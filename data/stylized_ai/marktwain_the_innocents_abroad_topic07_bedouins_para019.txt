Now, about these Bedouins, these chaps who’ve made the desert their address, a downright preposterous notion if you ask me. One would think, faced with such an abundance of sand and a glaring absence of, say, a decent hotel, a sensible fellow would pack his bags and head for a more hospitable clime. But no, not the Bedouins. They're as stubborn as a Missouri mule and about as likely to abandon their sun-baked patch as I am to give up cigars. They drift about in their tents, looking for all the world like oversized laundry escaped from a clothesline, following their camels like a gaggle of geese chasing a particularly slow loaf of bread.

And talk about resourcefulness! They can squeeze water out of rocks, or at least they claim to, though I’ve yet to witness this miracle. Personally, I suspect it involves a bit of sleight of hand and a strategically placed goatskin, but who am I to question the survival skills of a people who've managed to thrive where even a tumbleweed would think twice about settling down? They're a suspicious lot, these Bedouins, eyes as sharp as a newly honed razor and a penchant for hospitality that seems directly proportional to the value of the goods you’re carrying. Offer them tea, however, and they'll suddenly turn into your dearest friend, at least until the last drop is gone. Then it's back to assessing the contents of your saddlebags with a critical eye. Their stories are tall tales, mind you, exaggerated and embellished with the same fervor they apply to their coffee, but entertaining nonetheless. You might not believe a word of it, but you'll certainly laugh, and laughter, in my book, is worth more than all the gold one might find buried beneath those endless dunes. Just be sure to count your camels after they leave; one never knows when a Bedouin might develop an unforeseen fondness for livestock.
