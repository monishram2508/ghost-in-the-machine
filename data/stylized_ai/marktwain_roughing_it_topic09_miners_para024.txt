Now, these miners, bless their simple souls – simple as a hammer, you understand, not simple as a preacher – were a breed apart, you bet. A fella could spot 'em a mile off, even if they were wearin' Sunday-go-to-meetin' clothes. There'd be that perpetual layer of Nevada dust, clinging to their eyebrows like stubborn gold claims, and that walk – a sort of bow-legged shuffle acquired from spendin' half their life duck-walkin' through tunnels no bigger'n a badger's burrow. They were, in a word, industrious. Industrious at digging, industrious at cussing, and particularly industrious at concocting theories on where the next mother lode was hiding. You could trust a miner to spin a yarn thicker than the timbers holdin' up a drift; some of 'em swore they could smell silver like a hound dog smells rabbit, others read the secrets of the earth in the flight patterns of buzzards. 

They’d gamble away a month's wages on a hand of poker, then head back down the shaft the next morning, whistling a tune like they hadn't a care in the world. Their optimism was downright unnatural, I tell ya. A fella could lose his pick, his mule, and his best friend in a cave-in, and still be back on the surface that evenin', talkin' about how tomorrow’s the day his luck’s gonna turn. They weren't exactly pillars of the community, mind you. A few of 'em had a fondness for whiskey that could rot the teeth out of a mule, and their vocabulary wasn't exactly fit for polite company. But they were honest, in their own peculiar way. They wouldn't cheat you out of a gold nugget, but they might embellish the story of how they found it, just to make the tale a little more excitin’. And Lord knows, in this God-forsaken desert, a little excitement was worth more than a pound of gold dust. They were a rough lot, alright, but they were *our* rough lot, and Nevada wouldn't be Nevada without 'em.
