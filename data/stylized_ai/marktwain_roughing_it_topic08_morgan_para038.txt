Now, about this fellow Morgan, name sounded respectable enough, like it belonged on a steamer heading down the Mississippi, or maybe etched on a silver dollar fresh from the mint. But respectable appearances, as I’ve learned out West, are often thinner than a politician's promise after an election. He drifted into town with the ease of a tumbleweed carried on a summer breeze, claiming to be a geologist or some such thing. Said he was here to “assess the mineralogical potential” of the county. Mineralogical potential, indeed! That’s just fancy talk for poking around other folks’ property hoping to strike it rich, the lazy rascal.

He wore a coat far too fine for the dusty streets of Bodie, a coat that likely saw more of a tailor's shop than a saddle. Had spectacles perched on his nose that made him look less like a prospector and more like a schoolmarm who’d lost her way. And the way he handled a pickaxe! Lord have mercy, it was like watching a city slicker trying to milk a cow – all awkward angles and grunts, yielding nothing but frustration.

He'd spend his days scribbling in notebooks, consulting maps that looked older than Methuselah, and muttering about quartz veins and stratigraphic formations. All while the real miners were sweating blood and cursing the stubborn earth that wouldn't cough up its gold. Truth be told, I reckon he knew as much about geology as a jackrabbit knows about Shakespeare. He was more interested in the free meals he could cadge at the saloon by spinning tall tales about the riches he was bound to uncover. Claimed he had a scientific method. Seemed to me his method involved a healthy dose of wishful thinking and an uncanny ability to sniff out a fresh pot of coffee. Still, he never did find nothing but dust bunnies and idle gossip, poor fella. But he sure could talk a blue streak if you let him.
