Higbie, now there’s a specimen fit to study, a geological oddity as interesting as any petrified forest, if less useful for firewood. He was a man forged in the fires of adversity, or maybe just forged by a careless blacksmith. I never could quite tell the difference with him. He hailed from I forget where, some forgotten corner of the nation where folks still used butter churns and considered the telegraph a passing fad. He arrived in Nevada looking like he’d been chewed up and spat out by a particularly irascible mule; all dust, angles, and a suspicion that the world was actively conspiring against him. 

He was a partner in the Humboldt mining claim, a venture that looked more likely to yield regrets than riches. The only gold that mine ever produced was the kind you could find glistening in a prospector's eye after a particularly potent dose of rye whiskey. But Higbie, bless his deluded heart, clung to the hope like a starving man to a stale biscuit. He possessed the tenacity of a badger cornered in a drainpipe, though his business acumen was more akin to a blindfolded mule trying to navigate a crowded saloon.

He was a philosopher, of sorts, dispensing nuggets of wisdom gleaned from years of hardship and a distinct lack of formal education. His pronouncements were often delivered with the gravity of a Supreme Court Justice, though the content usually hovered somewhere between homespun common sense and utter lunacy. He could, for example, expound for hours on the proper method for training a donkey to dig for silver, a technique that, to my knowledge, has never proved successful but always provided a good laugh. And he was honest, bless him, honest as the day is long, though prone to exaggerations that would make Baron Munchausen blush. All in all, Higbie was a good man, a flawed man, a funny man. In short, he was a Nevadan. And that, in those wild days, was a recommendation in itself.
