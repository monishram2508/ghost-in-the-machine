Now, Carson City, that's a place. Not exactly bustlin' like a hornet's nest kicked over, mind you, but more like a drowsy old hound dog panting in the shade. It ain't San Francisco, bless its bustling heart. No sir. Here, the silence is thick enough to spread on a biscuit, and the main excitement seems to be watchin' the sagebrush tumble down the street like a drunk prospector tryin' to find his claim after a night at the saloon. You'll find the capitol building standin' there proud as a peacock in a chicken coop, tryin' to give the impression that important things are happening inside. Truth be told, most of the real action's probably takin' place at the Ormsby House, with a hand of poker and a tall glass of somethin' stronger than tea. I reckon the politicians just come there to get out of the sun and nap under the portrait of Old Abe.

The folks there, well, they're a breed of their own. A mix of silver-mining hopefuls still clinging to the dream, and shrewd merchants willing to sell them everything they need to chase that dream. You'll find a scattering of lawyers too, fattening up on land disputes and the misfortune of others – like vultures circling a dying mule, I tell ya. And don't forget the ladies, God bless 'em. They're tryin' their darnedest to bring some civilization to the place, with their fancy dresses and high-falutin' talk. But try as they might, it's hard to hide the dust and the grit that settles on everything out here, including the finer sensibilities. Carson, she's a tough old bird. Not pretty, but honest. A place where you can still see the bones of the wild west pokin' through the skin of respectability. Don't expect too much, and you might just find yourself enjoying the slow pace, the dry wit, and the general sense that nothin's ever really gonna change. At least, not fast.
