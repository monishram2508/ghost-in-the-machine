Now, concerning mosques, these edifices dedicated to the worship of the Almighty – or rather, *an* Almighty, for you know how these matters vary the world over – I’ve seen a fair few in my ramblings. Magnificent affairs they can be, all soaring minarets and dizzying domes, enough to make a man crane his neck 'til he nearly pops a button off his collar. One fellow I knew, a travelling salesman of religious paraphernalia, claimed the best mosques were always in the poorest towns. Said it was a sort of spiritual compensation, like a fella down on his luck being blessed with an unusually robust mustache. Perhaps he had a point, though I suspect he was mostly trying to offload his stock of embroidered prayer rugs at inflated prices.

But let’s not get bogged down in commerce, which, Lord knows, has a way of weaseling into everything, even piety. What strikes a fella about a mosque, assuming he dares venture inside, is the hush. A stillness so profound you can hear the echoes of your own thoughts, which, in some cases, is a blessing and in others, a downright curse. And then there’s the prostrating – all that bowing and kneeling. A man would think they’re trying to root for buried treasure, were it not for the solemn faces and whispered prayers. I once watched a group of them at it for a good hour, thinking maybe they were onto something, a lost hoard of gold perhaps. But alas, no. Just more praying. Seems a bit much, doesn’t it? All that effort when a simple "good morning" to the man upstairs might suffice. Though, I suppose if one is carrying a particularly heavy load of sin, a few extra bows couldn’t hurt. But me, I'm more inclined towards a good, long sit-down and a reasoned discussion. Less strenuous, and far more likely to get to the heart of the matter, wouldn't you agree?
