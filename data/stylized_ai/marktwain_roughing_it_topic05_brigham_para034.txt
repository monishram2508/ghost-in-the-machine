Brigham Young, ah, that man was a sight to behold, a regular Moses leading his flock to the promised land, only instead of milk and honey, this Utah promised hard work, sagebrush, and a whole heap of wives. I tell you, it takes a special kind of fella to manage so many women at once, and Brigham, he had that special something – be it charm, authority, or maybe just a really loud voice. He was a builder, too, that one, a veritable human beaver, damming rivers and erecting tabernacles faster than a fella could say “holy matrimony.” Salt Lake City, why, it sprang from the desert floor like a jackrabbit fleeing a prairie fire, all thanks to Brigham’s relentless pushing and prodding.

Now, don’t get me wrong, there were those that whispered behind their hands, calling him a tyrant, a despot, a regular blue-light district of moral ambiguity. And maybe, just maybe, there was a little truth to it. A man with that much power, that much influence, well, it’s bound to rust a few gears in his moral machinery. But you couldn’t deny his vision. He saw a future out there in that desolate wasteland, a future of thriving farms, bustling businesses, and, well, a whole lot of children. And he was right, blast him.

I remember seeing him once, perched on a buckboard, surveying his kingdom with the squinty-eyed gaze of a man who’d seen more dust devils than dollars. He looked like a cross between a prophet and a shrewd businessman, a man who could preach a sermon on Sunday and drive a hard bargain on Monday. And that, I reckon, was Brigham Young in a nutshell. A perplexing, complex, and undeniably impactful figure who shaped the West in ways that'd make a gold-rush prospector look like a Sunday-school teacher. He may not have been perfect, mind you, but he sure as heck wasn't boring, and in this dusty old world, that's saying something.
