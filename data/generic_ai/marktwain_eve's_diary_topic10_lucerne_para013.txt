Lucerne, often hailed as the "Queen of Forages," stands as a globally significant crop, prized for its exceptional nutritional value and versatility in agricultural systems. Known scientifically as *Medicago sativa*, this perennial legume is distinguished by its deep root system, enabling it to access water and nutrients from significant depths within the soil profile. This characteristic contributes to its drought tolerance, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited rainfall or fluctuating water availability. Lucerne boasts a high protein content, typically ranging from 15% to 25% in dry matter, making it an excellent feed source for livestock, particularly ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Its palatability is generally high, encouraging animals to readily consume it, further enhancing its nutritional benefits. Beyond protein, lucerne is also rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, contributing to the overall health and well-being of livestock. The plant’s ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in the soil is another crucial aspect of its agricultural significance. This nitrogen fixation reduces the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, lessening the environmental impact of farming practices and improving soil fertility. Lucerne is often used in crop rotations to improve soil health, break pest cycles, and enhance the yield of subsequent crops.

The cultivation of lucerne spans diverse climates and soil types, although it thrives best in well-drained soils with a neutral to slightly alkaline pH. Careful management practices, including proper irrigation, fertilization, and weed control, are essential to maximize yield and maintain stand longevity. Harvesting techniques vary, ranging from traditional haymaking to silage production, depending on local conditions and the intended use of the forage. Haymaking involves cutting and drying the lucerne in the field, followed by baling for storage. Silage production, on the other hand, involves fermenting the chopped lucerne in an anaerobic environment, preserving its nutritional value for later use. Lucerne faces challenges from pests and diseases, including alfalfa weevil, aphids, and various fungal pathogens. Integrated pest management strategies, incorporating cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of pesticides, are crucial for minimizing crop losses. Furthermore, selecting varieties that are resistant to prevalent diseases and pests is an important step in ensuring sustainable lucerne production. The ongoing research and development efforts continue to focus on improving lucerne's yield, nutritional value, disease resistance, and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions, solidifying its role as a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture.
