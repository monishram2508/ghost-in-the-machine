Now, a sepulchre, as I understand it, ain't just your common, everyday hole in the ground where you toss Uncle Jeb after he’s finally lost that wrestling match with the Grim Reaper. No sir, a sepulchre is a thing of grandeur, a regular showpiece designed to house the departed in a manner befitting their earthly status, or at least the surviving family’s perception thereof. You wouldn't just find one of those in some backwoods potter's field, no more than you'd find a decent cup of coffee in a boarding house. It’s usually got a bit of architecture about it, maybe a Grecian pediment stuck on the front like a misplaced eyebrow, or a couple of mournful-looking cherubs carved out of marble so white they practically glow in the dark, which, come to think of it, is probably the point.

I recall seeing one down in New Orleans, built for some cotton king or other, that was bigger than my first apartment. It had columns galore, an inscription in Latin that nobody could read but everyone pretended to understand, and enough room inside to hold a decent-sized picnic. Course, it looked like nobody had actually picnicked there in about a century, unless you count the spiders throwing tea parties in the corners. Makes you wonder, don’t it? Spending all that money to create a final resting place so impressive that it’s practically a second home, only to leave it to gather dust and the occasional pigeon dropping. Seems a bit like buying a fancy, gold-plated chamber pot: impressive to look at, but not exactly the best investment of your hard-earned dollars, especially after a Saturday night at the saloon.

But folks do it, and they’ll keep on doing it. I reckon it's something about wanting to leave your mark, even when you ain't around to see it. Or maybe it’s just plain old vanity, dressed up in the respectable garb of mourning. Whatever the reason, the world is full of these sepulchres, these silent, stone testimonies to lives lived and fortunes spent, all slowly crumbling away under the relentless march of time. And you know what? I suspect that a good many of the folks residing within would have much preferred a comfortable rocking chair and a glass of lemonade. But then again, I suppose nobody ever asked them.
