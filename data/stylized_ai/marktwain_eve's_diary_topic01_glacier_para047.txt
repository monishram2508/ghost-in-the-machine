Now, about this glacier, this grand, glistening slab of frozen obstinacy. Eve, naturally, insisted on calling it a “giant diamond brooch,” which, I will concede, has a certain poetic ring to it, though it lacks the grit and practicality a man requires when describing something that could, with a snide little shove, bury you alive. It's a slowpoke, that much is certain. Adam might have seen it move, but I suspect he was more occupied with naming the various breeds of lichen clinging to its frosty edges. You see, it's been crawling along, inching its way down from the mountains since, well, since before Eve decided fig leaves were all the rage.

They say it carves valleys, this icy behemoth, like some heavenly sculptor gone mad with a chisel. I prefer to think of it as nature’s way of reminding us that patience, even when possessed by a refrigerator the size of a kingdom, has its rewards. Observe the river, you see, born from the glacier’s chilly tears! Such a thing makes one think it wouldn’t have been possible without the slow, crushing, inevitable march of the glacier, no matter how long it takes. Adam, bless his simple heart, attempted to measure its progress with a vine he’d knotted at intervals. Of course, the vine went missing, presumably used by some enterprising squirrel to construct a swing of unprecedented luxury. That’s the problem with these scientific endeavors, I tell you; there's always a squirrel, or a butterfly, or some other bit of mischief conspiring to undermine the whole project. But the glacier, it doesn't care about squirrels or vines or even Eve’s fanciful metaphors. It just keeps plodding along, a frozen testament to the fact that even the most stubborn of things, given enough time, can reshape the world. I reckon if we all had that kind of glacial determination, why, we’d be living in a veritable paradise, fig leaves and all.
