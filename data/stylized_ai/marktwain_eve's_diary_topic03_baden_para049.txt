Baden-Baden. A name so pleasantly repetitious it sounds like a well-fed baby cooing to its nurse. And indeed, it is a place for the cosseted and coddled, the sort of folk who feel faint if the soup isn't lukewarm enough, or the diamonds don't precisely match their complexion. One arrives expecting, perhaps, a bustling German burg, all sausages and serious stares. Instead, one finds a veritable hothouse of leisure, a garden where titled weeds bloom in the sun of generous pensions. The air itself is perfumed with the delicate scent of money, mixed with a subtle, medicinal odor emanating from the various spas. It seems every building is either a bathhouse, a bank, or a purveyor of ridiculously expensive bonbons. One almost expects to see fountains spouting not water, but lukewarm champagne.

The humans! Ah, the humans. They are a study in themselves. The men, adorned in rakish mustaches and questionable sporting attire, strut about like peacocks who've inherited the farm. They gamble with fortunes at the casino, losing with a nonchalant shrug that suggests they misplaced a similar sum just yesterday. The ladies, meanwhile, are visions swathed in silks and satins, their faces carefully constructed with powders and paints, like miniature works of art requiring daily restoration. They sip at weak tea, whisper scandalous nothings, and generally conduct themselves with the sort of languid elegance that suggests they've never lifted anything heavier than a lorgnette. The entire scene is so perfectly, almost artificially, serene that one suspects the town employs a full-time worrier to keep the unpleasantness at bay. A chap, no doubt, whose job it is to ensure the sun always shines and the dividends always arrive on time, or face a stern talking-to from a Duchess whose pet poodle has caught a chill. One leaves Baden-Baden feeling rather like one has just stepped out of a particularly elaborate and expensive dream. And, frankly, relieved to be back in the real world, where one can actually afford a decent sausage.
