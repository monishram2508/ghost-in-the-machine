Now, Morgan, there was a specimen! A fellow built like a Missouri mule – all stubborn angles and surprising bursts of speed when he wanted to reach the whiskey bottle. Claimed he’d wrestled a grizzly bear once, though the bear’s side of the story never surfaced, so I remain skeptical. Morgan drifted into Virginia City looking like he'd been chewed up and spat out by the Sierra Nevada, which, come to think of it, wasn’t too far from the truth. He fancied himself a philosopher, spouting off on the inherent flaws of mankind while simultaneously trying to swindle you out of your last dime. He was, in short, a walking contradiction, as common in those parts as dust and delirium tremens.

He tried his hand at everything, that Morgan did. Mining, of course, like the rest of us fools, chasing after a phantom fortune in the bowels of the earth. Struck nothing but fool's gold and damp disappointment, though he swore he'd almost tasted the gleam of silver on more than one occasion. Then he attempted storekeeping, a venture that swiftly collapsed when he started extending credit to every hard-luck story that wandered in, which, in a boomtown, was a line stretching longer than the Nevada desert itself. He even took a stab at preaching, believe it or not! Thundered about sin and damnation with the same gusto he’d used to denounce the quality of saloon whiskey. The congregation, mostly comprised of gamblers and former outlaws, listened politely enough, probably just waiting for the collection plate to come around. It was a spectacle, I tell you, watching a man preach against avarice while sporting a diamond stickpin the size of a hen's egg – presumably donated by a particularly repentant sinner. Morgan, bless his misguided soul, he was a walking advertisement for the absurdities of the human condition, a testament to the fact that even a man who tripped over his own moral compass could still land on his feet, usually right in front of the nearest bar.
