Chamonix, they call it. A village clinging to the skirts of Mont Blanc like a nervous child to its mother's apron strings. I ventured there, you see, seeking rejuvenation, perhaps a touch of that invigorating alpine air to blow away the cobwebs clinging to my weary soul. They do say the air is thin up yonder, and I believe it must be so, for it seems to have addled the brains of half the visitors. They come swarming like ants to a dropped jam tart, these alpinists, swathed in more layers than an onion and sporting contraptions strapped to their feet that could cripple a small ox. And for what? To hurl themselves down a mountainside covered in ice, risking life and limb for the thrill of it! One fellow I observed, a rosy-cheeked chap with a beard like a tangled bird's nest, proudly proclaimed he was “conquering” the mountain. Conquering, indeed! The mountain, I suspect, is merely tolerating him, much as one tolerates a particularly irritating housefly buzzing about one's nose. 

The town itself is a curious spectacle, a hodgepodge of quaint chalets and establishments catering to the aforementioned thrill-seekers. Shops overflowing with overpriced climbing ropes and suspiciously bright-colored thermal underwear sit cheek-by-jowl with establishments offering restorative beverages and edible concoctions one might describe as… adventurous. I partook of a cheese fondue, naturally, which proved to be an experience. A bubbling pot of dairy madness, seemingly designed to scald the unwary tongue and leave one feeling as if they had swallowed a small, overheated furnace. The locals, bless their industrious hearts, seem unfazed by the constant influx of wide-eyed tourists. They go about their business with a quiet efficiency, a sort of patient resignation that suggests they have seen it all before, and are quite certain they will see it all again tomorrow. I suspect they have a secret stash of soothing herbal tea, to combat the madness. It all amounts to a right proper circus, really, with a mountain as the stage and humanity as the eager clowns. One cannot help but be amused, albeit with a slight tremor of pity for those who think they are truly in control.
