Lucerne, you say? Why, I've seen Lucerne, and I daresay it's a right pretty little town, though not so little that a body can swallow it whole, mind you. It's perched there on the edge of that confounded Lake Lucerne, or Vierwaldstättersee as the locals call it, a name that sounds like a sneeze in a Swiss yodeler's convention. The lake itself is picturesque, I suppose, if you're one for that sort of thing. All sparkly and blue with those pointy mountains sticking straight up out of it like petrified fingers accusing Heaven of something or other. 

They say it's historic, too, Lucerne, what with its Chapel Bridge, all burnt and rebuilt like a phoenix with a terrible headache, and them water tower lookin' things. They tell stories of heroes and battles and ancient oaths sworn on mountain tops, but I suspect half of it's been embroidered so much over the years that it's thicker than a Mississippi riverboat gambler's yarn. The Swiss are mighty proud of their history, and bless their hearts, they've got a right to be. But I reckon every country has its tall tales, just some taller than others, you see.

The town itself is full of shops selling cuckoo clocks and chocolate, both of which are undeniably charming in small doses, but can quickly turn a fellow's stomach if consumed in large quantities, like a plate of oysters. The tourists, of course, are thicker than flies on a molasses jug. Gawking at the scenery, snapping pictures, and generally getting in the way of anyone trying to have a sensible walk. Still, they're a harmless lot, and they do bring money into the town, which is more than I can say for most philosophers. And that's the thing about Lucerne, it's a pretty enough place, but a bit like a perfectly iced cake; lovely to look at, but lacking a certain… grit. A little dust, a little hardship, a little something to make you feel like you've actually lived, instead of just passed through a postcard. I wouldn't mind going back sometime, mind you, but I wouldn't sell my farm for the pleasure, either. No sir, not by a long shot.
