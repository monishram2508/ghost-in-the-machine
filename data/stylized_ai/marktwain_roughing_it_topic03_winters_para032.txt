Winter in the Sierras, bless its cotton socks, is a spectacle to behold, though not necessarily one you’d choose to behold from inside a leaky tent whilst your beard freezes to your chest. Seems like the blasted season hangs around longer than a politician dodging a question, draping itself over the mountains like a mournful widow in yards and yards of flour-sack white. Snow! Lordy, there's more snow than good sense in a mining town on payday. It piles up till the pines look like ghosts wearing pointed hats, and the cabins sink so deep you’d think they were trying to escape the scenery altogether. You can wager your last dollar that the sun, that lazy varmint, won't be showing its face much either. He peeks out now and again, just long enough to give you a taste of warmth before ducking back behind the clouds like a scared rabbit. 

Folks say it's beautiful, all serene and untouched. Untouched? More like un-travelable. Try getting a wagon through ten feet of the stuff, and then tell me about serenity. The animals, they’ve got the right idea, hibernating away like they know something you don’t. Me, I’m stuck here, same as always. Can't say I much mind it, truth be told, though I might sing a different tune come February when the firewood's dwindled to kindling and the beans are starting to taste like sawdust. Still, there’s a certain charm to the solitude, a kind of quiet that lets you hear yourself think, which can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on what’s rattling around up there. And besides, a man’s gotta have a good yarn to tell when the thaw finally comes, and hardship, like a good whiskey, often makes for the best stories, whether they're entirely factual or not.
