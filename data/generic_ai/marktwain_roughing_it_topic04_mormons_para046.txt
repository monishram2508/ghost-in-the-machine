The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, originated in the United States in the 19th century. Joseph Smith Jr., the founder, claimed to have received divine revelations leading to the translation of the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible. This book, along with other writings, outlines a narrative of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. Core Mormon beliefs include the divinity of Jesus Christ, the importance of family, and the concept of continuing revelation. They believe God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets, just as He did in biblical times, with the current president of the Church considered a living prophet. Mormons also emphasize the restoration of the original church established by Jesus Christ, which they believe was lost through apostasy. Temples hold a central place in Mormon worship, where sacred ordinances, such as temple marriage (sealing) and baptisms for the dead, are performed. These ordinances are understood to have eternal consequences, extending beyond mortal life.

A strong emphasis is placed on missionary work, with young men and women often serving voluntary two-year missions around the world, sharing their beliefs and engaging in community service. The Church has a hierarchical structure, with local congregations (wards) led by bishops and regional areas overseen by stake presidents. Tithing, the donation of ten percent of one's income, is a central tenet of their faith, funding the Church's operations and charitable activities. Mormons follow a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which encourages abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, and harmful drugs, and promoting a healthy lifestyle. The Church has faced historical controversies, including the practice of polygamy in the 19th century, which was officially discontinued. Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a global faith with millions of members worldwide, involved in humanitarian efforts, education, and cultural preservation. Their unique theology and communal values have shaped a distinct identity, contributing significantly to the religious landscape.
