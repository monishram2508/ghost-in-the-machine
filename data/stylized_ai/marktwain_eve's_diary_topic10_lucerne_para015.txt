Lucerne, they call it, perched there on the edge of that lake like a prim little hen admiring her own reflection. Said lake being so blue, you could practically paint heaven with it, though I reckon the angels would complain it lacks the proper moral greyness. The mountains looming behind are all right too, though I confess, I’ve seen taller ones, and funnier ones, mind you. These have a certain stern, Protestant air about them, like they’re perpetually disapproving of the tourists traipsing about below. And Lord, are there tourists! Thick as flies on a honeymoon cake, buzzing about, all snapping pictures of the Kapellbrücke, that rickety old bridge with the paintings dangling overhead, looking for all the world like a forgotten laundry line. They gaze upon it with such solemnity, you'd think they were deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls, instead of mildly gruesome scenes of Saint Somebody being boiled, or burned, or generally put out of his misery in inventive ways.

The Swiss, bless their meticulous hearts, are terribly proud of the place, and who can blame them? They've got their clockwork trains running on time, their streets so clean you could eat off them, and enough chocolate to give every dentist in Europe a stroke of good fortune. And the shops! Good heavens, the shops. Overflowing with cuckoo clocks that cuckoo incessantly, causing one to long for the simple peace and quiet of a boiler factory. Then there's the knives, each one sharper than the wit of a tax collector, and the watches, precise enough to track the movements of a snail contemplating his navel. It’s all very… efficient, very proper, very Swiss. Makes a body wonder if they ever indulge in a good, old-fashioned shouting match, or perhaps spill their beer on purpose, just for the sheer rebellious joy of it. Still, you can't fault the scenery, or the general sense of well-being that permeates the place. Lucerne, it might not set your soul on fire, but it’ll certainly keep it neatly tucked in, well-fed, and perfectly on schedule, whether you like it or not.
