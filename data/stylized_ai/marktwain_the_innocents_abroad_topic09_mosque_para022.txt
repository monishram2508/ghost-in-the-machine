Now, concerning these mosques, which are peppered about like raisins in a rather dusty pudding across the lands of Islam, a fella can't help but notice a certain… flourish. They’re not shy, these buildings. No sir, they thrust skyward with minarets like so many colossal, albeit exquisitely decorated, pencils. Built to reach the heavens, I reckon, though I've yet to see one nudge the celestial sphere. A bit of earthly ambition there, if you ask me.

Inside, it’s a different kettle of fish altogether. One sheds one's boots – a sensible precaution considering the intricate carpets that would make a sultan weep with envy, though I suspect the weeping might be partly due to the realization he had to foot the bill. And there, spread out like a field of prostrate wheat before the scythe, are the faithful, all pointed in the direction of Mecca, presumably hoping for a timely delivery of good fortune. It's a democracy of prayer, of sorts, though one suspects some pray a little louder than others.

I've watched them, these worshippers, and I must say, they're a study in contrasts. Some are lost in reverie, eyes closed tight, muttering incantations that sound suspiciously like a complicated stock transaction. Others, and I suspect these are the fellows with young 'uns, are perpetually attempting to quell the stirrings of restless limbs and the hushed whispers of boredom that threaten to disrupt the tranquility. And then there's the obligatory fellow who clears his throat with the force of a small cannon, adding his own rather enthusiastic punctuation to the collective supplication. It's all quite a sight, a grand opera of faith, though played out in hushed tones and sans divas in Viking helmets. Makes you wonder, don’t it, what the Almighty makes of it all? Perhaps he’s got a soft spot for the loud throat-clearer, or perhaps He just sighs and wishes they’d all invest in cough drops. One never knows with the Big Guy, one never knows.
