Now, about this portier contraption. Imagine, if you will, a drapery, stout and imposing, hung not for the purpose of keeping out the vulgar sun or the prying eyes of neighbors, but for the rather more ambitious aim of keeping out drafts and, I suspect, a good deal of unwanted conversation. Seems to me a mortal fancy to put up a curtain between one room and another, as if a wall weren't sufficient statement for the boundaries of human habitation. One might as well hang a screen between the hours of dinner and dessert, just to keep the courses from getting too friendly.

I caught sight of one of these monstrosities at a friend’s estate, a man who fancies himself a purveyor of all things luxurious and modern. He called it, with a flourish, a “portier,” which, I gather, is French for “door-keeper,” though goodness knows what door it's keeping, hung as it is in the middle of a perfectly good archway. The thing itself was of a heavy velvet, thick as a miser’s wallet and about as inviting. It was embroidered with flowers, each blossom seemingly in mortal combat with the one next to it. A battle of the posies, I called it, much to the man's ire.

And the practicality of it, you ask? Why, bless your simple heart, it’s as practical as a chocolate teapot. To pass from one room to another, one must wrestle with the blasted thing, tugging at its heavy folds like a reluctant lover. And then, of course, it billows and sways, casting dramatic shadows that make one think there's a lurking villain behind every chair. Gives one the shivers, it does. It seems to me a simple door would be less of a fuss, less theatrical, and certainly less inclined to gather dust bunnies like a magpie gathers shiny trinkets. But there it is, a portier, standing guard over the space between the parlor and the dining room, a velvet sentinel against the horrors of… well, I haven’t quite figured out what horrors it’s protecting against yet, but I trust my friend believes them dire indeed.
