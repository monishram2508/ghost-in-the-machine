Now, these Mormons, they're a peculiar bunch, a regular human menagerie settled down in this here desert like tumbleweeds after a dust devil's calmed. Salt Lake City, they call it, a town built on faith and, I reckon, a right considerable amount of sweat equity. Brigham Young, he led 'em here, a prophet with a gaze like a hawk eyeing a field mouse, and a will that could bend iron. Course, the stories they tell about him and his wives, well, a feller hardly knows what to believe. Some say he had more wives than days in a year, a regular matrimonial mogul, and others swear it's just plain exaggeration, the kind that thrives in the thin mountain air. But one thing's for certain, there was a lot of comings and goings around his house, and a heap of children popping up like desert flowers after a rare rain.

They're industrious folks, the Mormons, no denying that. They've turned this barren wasteland into something resembling a garden, irrigating the land with a system so complicated it'd make a beaver blush. They sing hymns with a gusto that could rattle your fillings, and they're as sober as a judge on a Sunday. Though, I did hear tell of a fella down in Cedar City who brewed up a batch of juniper berry "tea" that had a kick like a mule, but that's neither here nor there. Mostly, they're just trying to make a living, raising families, and praying to their peculiar god. They're friendly enough, though they do look at you a tad sideways if you offer them a cup of coffee or a cigar. Seems their prophet had a thing against stimulants, which, frankly, I reckon is a darn shame. Still, they’ll share a loaf of bread and a tall tale with you, and in this part of the country, that’s worth more than a gold mine. You can't help but admire their dedication, even if their beliefs are a bit… well, let's just say they’re enough to make a preacher sweat.
