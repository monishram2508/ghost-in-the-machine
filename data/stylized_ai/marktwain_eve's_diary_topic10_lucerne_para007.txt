Lucerne, now, there's a town that thinks well enough of itself, much like a peacock admires its tailfeathers in a looking glass. Nestled on the edge of that Lake of Lucerne, as blue and shiny as a freshly polished sapphire, it preens and poses for all the world to see. They've got mountains standing sentinel 'round about, those grand old fellows, perpetually dusted with snow, and the Reuss River twisting through the town like a silver ribbon carelessly dropped by a tipsy angel. The Lion Monument, carved into the rock face to commemorate those Swiss Guards who went down fighting in the French Revolution, is a sight, I confess. Pathos enough to water a stone, though I did overhear one tourist remark that it looked like a particularly glum house cat who'd just been told there'd be no cream for supper. Can't say I entirely disagreed. The Chapel Bridge, with its painted panels showing scenes from Swiss history – some a bit more enthusiastic than accurate, I wager – is another thing they’re proud of. Walkin' across it, one can't help but feel a touch of the past brushing up against one's present. Though it also brushes up against a constant stream of picture-takers, all jostling for the perfect angle, a veritable swarm of clickin' contraptions.

The locals, mind you, seem to take it all in stride. They're a sturdy lot, the Swiss, built for the mountains, not given to fluster. You'll find 'em in the cafes, sipping coffee that's strong enough to stand a spoon in, and discussing matters of state with a seriousness that would make a senator blush. And the shops! Filled to bursting with cuckoo clocks that cuckoo with alarming frequency, chocolate that could tempt a saint, and pocket knives that could disassemble a small automobile. It's a commercial paradise, that is, if your purse is deep enough. Otherwise, it’s more of a window-shopper’s purgatory. But one can’t deny the town’s charms. It's a stage, Lucerne is, and a well-appointed one at that. The players are the tourists, the backdrop is the majestic scenery, and the plot, well, the plot is simply to enjoy it all, preferably with a full wallet and a healthy appreciation for the absurd.
