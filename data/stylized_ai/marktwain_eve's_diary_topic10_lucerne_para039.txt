Lucerne, bless its heart, is a town so picturesque, it makes you suspect the Almighty Himself spent a Sunday afternoon dabbling in watercolors and accidentally knocked over a pot of cerulean. The lake, a veritable looking glass for the mountains that stand ‘round like stern old uncles watching over a particularly flighty niece, is so calm it almost feels guilty. I half expected a trout to surface, wearing spectacles and carrying a tiny ledger, demanding payment for the scenery. They say the water is crystal clear, which is undoubtedly true, though I reckon if you gazed into it long enough you'd find a committee of mermaids arguing over the proper way to starch a petticoat. The Lion Monument, carved into the cliff face, is supposed to evoke pathos and remembrance of the Swiss Guards. Well, it does, in a manner of speaking. It evokes the pathos of a creature who’s had a particularly bad day involving a sharp pointy thing, and a distinct remembrance that one should probably avoid sharp pointy things in the future. The whole town seems constructed on the principle that anything less than charming is a mortal sin. The bridges are covered with paintings of local notables who, judging by their expressions, seem perpetually surprised to find themselves not milking a cow or wrestling a bear. And the clock towers! Good heavens, the clock towers. They chime the hour with such punctual precision, it's enough to make a sundial blush with shame. They say time is money, and in Lucerne, time seems to be a particularly gaudy, Swiss-made pocket watch, dripping with rubies and stubbornly accurate, reminding you that you're spending your hard-earned cash to be utterly, unapologetically delighted. One almost feels compelled to leave a generous tip for the town's sheer commitment to being so damnably, beautifully, flawlessly…Lucerne. It's enough to make a cynic believe in fairies, or at least, heavily subsidized tourism boards.
