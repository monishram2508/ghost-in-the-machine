Chamonix, you see, is a place where the Almighty, having finished with Switzerland and, perhaps, feeling a touch peckish after all that mountain-building, decided to dabble in a bit of monumental pastry artistry. He piled up these immense snow-dusted meringues – the Alps, they call 'em, fancy that – and stuck the most magnificent one right here. Mont Blanc, looming over the whole confounded valley like a disapproving headmaster with a perpetual ice-cream headache. The air is thin enough to keep your wits sharpened – or perhaps it just makes them appear so; hard to tell the difference after a few days spent arguing with a mule about the correct path up the Col du Balme. The hotels are crammed with those sorts who either yearn to fall off these monumental confectionery creations on purpose, with skis strapped to their feet and hope in their hearts, or those who are very determined to ascend to the top using ropes, picks, and enough equipment to open a small hardware store. The locals, bless their weathered faces, seem perpetually amused by the whole charade. They've seen it all before, you understand: the Englishmen in tweed, the Germans with maps the size of tablecloths, the French arguing passionately about cheese, and the inevitable avalanche of discarded fondue pots. You can’t swing a cat without hitting a purveyor of overpriced climbing gear or a café serving coffee so strong it could wake the dead (useful, considering the aforementioned skiers). And the glaciers! Oh, the glaciers are magnificent, flowing down the mountains like frozen rivers of time, carrying with them the whispers of ages past and the occasional unsuspecting tourist who strayed a bit too close for a better photograph. It is a place, Chamonix, where you can simultaneously feel your insignificance against the backdrop of nature's grandeur and be outrageously gouged for a fondue dinner. A truly democratic experience, if I ever saw one.
