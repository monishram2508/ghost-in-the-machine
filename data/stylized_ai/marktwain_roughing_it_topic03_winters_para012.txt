Winter, ah, that icy-fingered scoundrel that comes sneakin’ in like a claim-jumper in the dead of night. Folks ‘round these parts, come December, start lookin’ a bit like squirrels buryin’ nuts – only instead of nuts, it’s woodpiles they’re amassin’, high as a preacher’s brim hat. And the wind, well, that’s a varmint all its own. Howlin’ like a coyote chorus gone mad, it sneaks through cracks you didn't even know you had, chillin' you right down to the bone marrow, guaranteed. Makes a man question why he ever left the sunny climes of somewhere-or-other. Now, I’ve seen winters in Nevada that could freeze a brass monkey to a pulp, and others that were mild as a parson's sermon. But this one, this one’s been a bit of a card, I reckon.

We had a snowfall last week, the likes of which I haven't witnessed since that time I tried to make a fortune selling snowshoes in Death Valley. It blanketed the whole dang town, making it look like some giant ghost had draped a sheet over everything. Prettiest sight you ever did see, until you had to actually shovel your way out of your own house. The mules were half-buried, the hens were lookin' bewildered, and old man Johnson swore he saw a polar bear walkin' down Main Street. Said he’d been sippin’ a bit too much of his winter tonic, but you never know with Johnson, that feller's got an imagination wilder than a drunken prospector. Then there's the ice. It coats everything, turning roads into rinks and making a simple walk to the outhouse a potential Olympic event. More than one fella has ended up flat on his back, starin' up at the sky wonderin' what in tarnation just happened. But, come to think of it, it ain't all bad. The saloons are warmer, the stories are taller, and the whiskey flows a bit freer when the snow's pilin' up outside. And besides, it can't last forever, can it? At least, that's what I keep tellin' myself as I’m shovelin’ my way to the woodpile for the fifth time today.
