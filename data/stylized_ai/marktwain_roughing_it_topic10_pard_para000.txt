Now, Pard, being in the Nevada Territory back then, was a bit like finding a diamond in a dungheap – unexpected, yet surrounded by a whole lot of… well, you catch my drift. He was a feller who claimed roots back in Tennessee, though if you asked him directly, he’d hem and haw and say something like, “Borned betwixt the briars and the blessings, I reckon.” Which, coming from Pard, was as close to a straight answer as you'd get from a politician during election season. He wasn’t much to look at, mind you. Skin tanned like saddle leather, eyes squinted permanent-like from staring into the desert sun, and a beard that looked like a family of badgers had taken up residence. But Lordy, that man could spin a yarn that’d make a preacher blush and a gambler reach for his deck. He worked as a prospector, mostly, though “worked” might be too strong a word. “Loafed in the general vicinity of pay dirt” would be more accurate. He claimed to have a nose for silver, but I suspect it was more a talent for sniffing out the nearest saloon. Still, he always managed to scrape together enough dust to buy a round or two, which made him popular in certain circles, namely the circle of fellers too lazy to prospect for themselves. He had this way of sizing you up, too. A slow, considering look that made you feel like you were being weighed on scales and judged by a jury of tumbleweeds. And he always had a saying for every occasion. If you were down on your luck, he’d tell you, “Even a blind hog finds an acorn now and then.” If you were feeling particularly full of yourself, he’d remind you, “Pride goeth before a fall, and a stiff neck before a busted nose.” And if you were just plain ornery, well, he'd probably just chuckle, shake his head, and buy you another drink, figuring it was the only cure for what ailed ya. He was a conundrum, that Pard. A walking, talking, storytelling enigma wrapped in dust and delusion. But, by thunder, he was entertaining.
