Well, I do declare, this "glacier" contraption is quite the spectacle, though I'm not entirely certain what purpose it serves beyond giving one a rather unpleasant chill. It's a monstrous, creeping beast made of ice, imagine a colossal wedding cake left out in the rain for a century, only instead of sugar frosting, it's all this hard, bluish stuff that bites at your fingers something awful. They say it flows, this glacier, moves along like a sleepy snail crossed with a stubborn mule. But you wouldn't know it by looking, oh no. You could stand there until kingdom come and not see an inch of progress, though I dare say you'd freeze solid in the attempt. 

And the noise! One expects silence from something so frozen and austere, but bless my soul, it groans and creaks like an old house settling on its foundations, a symphony of geological complaints. Every now and then, there's a mighty crack, like a giant clearing his throat, and a chunk of ice the size of a barn will break off and go tumbling down, creating a splash that could baptize a small town. Of course, the learned fellows, the ones with spectacles perched on their noses and theories sprouting from their ears, they explain it all very scientifically. They talk of pressure and accumulation and whatnot, but I suspect it's simply the glacier reminding everyone who’s boss. They say it carved out valleys and shaped the land, which is all well and good, I suppose, but I can't help but think there was probably a less drafty way to go about it. Still, one has to admire its persistence. It's been at this business for centuries, grinding and scraping and generally making a nuisance of itself, and showing no signs of slowing down. If only humans were so dedicated to something useful!
