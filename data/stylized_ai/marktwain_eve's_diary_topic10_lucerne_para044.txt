Lucerne, bless its little heart, is a town that appears to have been varnished to a high, almost blinding sheen. It sits there, nestled by its lake, all prim and proper, like a dowager expecting callers. They've got their Lion Monument, a beast carved out of rock, looking remarkably like it’s got a terrible headache. Likely the noise; the town is perpetually being serenaded by the tinkling of cowbells – a sound I suspect has driven many a tourist to the brink of utter madness. Then there's Chapel Bridge, all covered with paintings that seem to be telling stories, though I confess I haven't the foggiest notion what those stories might be. Maybe they’re about tax collection, which would explain the glum expressions.

They seem fiercely proud of their cleanliness, which, while admirable, also hints at a deep-seated fear of a stray crumb. I reckon a fellow could eat off the cobblestones without fear of contracting anything worse than boredom. I saw a chap drop an ice cream cone, and before you could say “William Tell,” three different people had swooped in with napkins and apologies, almost weeping over the fallen confection. It’s a town where you feel compelled to whisper, lest you disturb the delicate balance of respectability. Even the pigeons walk with a certain dignified air, as if fully aware of the photographic opportunities they present.

The Swiss, generally, are a reserved lot, and the Lucerners are no exception. They greet you with politeness bordering on suspicion, as if wondering if you're secretly plotting to steal a chunk of their mountains or make off with their cuckoo clocks. But Lord, the clocks! You can’t swing a cat without hitting a cuckoo clock shop in Lucerne. They're hanging everywhere, each one boasting its own manic little bird, ready to spring forth and herald the hour with an enthusiasm that borders on hysteria. After a day of it, you start to suspect that the entire town is run by these feathered fiends, their tiny gears dictating the rhythm of life in this ridiculously charming, meticulously maintained, and profoundly exhausting corner of the world. A charming prison, if you will. But mind you, a very clean one.
