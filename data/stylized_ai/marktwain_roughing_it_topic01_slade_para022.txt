Slade, that alkali dust-hole clinging to the desert's rim like a tick on a dog's ear, now there’s a sight to curdle your buttermilk. A settlement it calls itself, though a collection of sun-baked shacks and canvas tents would be a kinder description. I reckon the only thing plentiful in Slade besides tumbleweeds and discontent is the flies. They swarm over everything, mind you, thick as thieves at a political rally. Tried to swat one once, near took off my own ear in the process. Wouldn't surprise me none if they started electing a fly mayor pretty soon, seeing as how they outnumber the registered voters ten to one.

I spent a night there once, just once, mind you. That was more than enough to last me a lifetime. Found a room, if you can call it that, at the 'Slade Hotel.' A plank bed with a straw mattress, and a window that looked out onto a particularly desolate patch of dirt. Charged me two dollars for the privilege, too. Two dollars! Highway robbery, I tell you. I've slept better under a Joshua tree with a rattlesnake for company.

The entertainment in Slade consisted mostly of watching a dog chase its tail in the middle of the street, and listening to the incessant whine of the wind. There was a saloon, of course, but the whiskey tasted suspiciously like embalming fluid, and the patrons looked like they'd lost a fight with a buzzsaw. I saw one fellow try to start a conversation with a prairie dog. That’s about the height of the intellectual discourse you can expect to find there. All in all, Slade struck me as the kind of place where a man goes to forget he exists, and probably succeeds. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy, unless, of course, my worst enemy happened to be a particularly fond of flies and alkali dust. Then, maybe, just maybe, he'd find something to appreciate. But I still wouldn't bet on it.
