The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormonism, is a restorationist branch of Christianity that originated in the United States during the 1820s with Joseph Smith Jr. Smith claimed to have received divine visitations and translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates he unearthed, supplementing the Bible as scripture. This book recounts the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who migrated from the Middle East and details a visit by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. Mormons believe that the original Christian church fell into apostasy and that Smith was chosen to restore the true Church of Jesus Christ to the earth. This restoration includes a unique understanding of priesthood authority, which is believed to be necessary to perform saving ordinances such as baptism and temple sealings. These ordinances, often performed by proxy for deceased ancestors, are central to Mormon theology, reflecting a strong emphasis on family and the eternal nature of relationships. Mormons adhere to a health code called the Word of Wisdom, which discourages the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, emphasizing physical and spiritual well-being. Missionary work is a prominent aspect of the faith, with young adults typically serving voluntary missions lasting 18-24 months, proselytizing and providing service around the world. Latter-day Saints also place a strong emphasis on education, community involvement, and self-reliance. The Church is organized hierarchically, with lay members participating in leadership roles at the local level. The First Presidency, composed of the Prophet and his counselors, guides the Church globally. Temple worship, distinct from regular Sunday services, involves sacred ordinances and covenants that are believed to prepare individuals for eternal life in the presence of God. Over time, the Church has evolved, notably renouncing polygamy in the late 19th century. Today, the Church has a global presence, with millions of members worldwide drawn to its message of hope, community, and eternal family connections.
