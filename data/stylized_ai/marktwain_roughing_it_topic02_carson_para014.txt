Now, Carson City. Lord, what a place. They called it a city, mind you, and I reckon in these western territories, you slap enough saloons and claim a pile of dust a 'city' easy enough. It perched there, Carson did, right on the edge of the mountains, like a buzzard eyeing a carcass. A lonely, dusty carcass, I might add. They had their government buildings, fancy enough, trying to give the impression of civilization. But you can't fool old Mark Twain, no sir. Underneath all that varnish and pretense, it was still just a mining town, smelling of silver and desperation. 

The streets? Bless your heart if you tried to navigate them sober. Rutted and rambling, going every which way like a pack of stray dogs chasing a jackrabbit. And the people! Oh, the humanity. You had your politicians, always with a hand out and a story ready, smoother than a greased pig. Then you had the miners, covered in more dirt than a potato, their faces lined with hard work and harder luck. And, of course, the gamblers, slicked back hair and shifty eyes, dealing out fortunes and misfortunes with equal aplomb. You could lose your shirt in Carson faster than a sneeze on a cold day.

I remember one fella, name of Silas, bless his simple heart, he came to Carson with enough gold to buy a small ranch back east. Two weeks later, he was sleeping under a wagon, his pockets lighter than a feather. Claimed he’d just had a run of bad luck, the poor sap. Bad luck, my foot! He was just outmatched by those vultures in the gambling dens. That's Carson for you: a place where fortunes are made and lost quicker than a politician's promise, and where the only thing more plentiful than silver is the gullibility of the newcomer. A man could write a book about the characters in that town, and likely find himself short a shirt and boots by the time he finished the last chapter. I daresay, a book nobody would pay for, seeing as their own shirts and boots were already at risk.
