Slade, now there's a feller who could curdle milk with a glance and probably did, just for the sheer entertainment of it. Why, if Lucifer himself ever needed a stand-in for a particularly bleak Tuesday, Slade was the man to call. They called him "king," mind you, though what he reigned over was mostly dust, despair, and the uneasy souls that happened to be passing through Mud Springs, which, to be honest, weren't fit for much else either. He was built like a blacksmith’s anvil, all hard angles and unforgiving edges, and dressed, as I recall, in a buckskin suit that looked like it had been tanned by a grizzly bear with a grudge. His eyes, now those were something. Like chipped flints, they were, cold and capable of starting a fire you wouldn’t want to be standing near.

He had a habit of whittling, Slade did, usually on a piece of pine that would eventually resemble some misshapen critter or other. More often than not, though, he’d just whittle shavings, letting them fall to the floor like so many silent accusations. It was unnerving, I tell you. Made a body feel like he was being sized up for a coffin, one splinter at a time. And his voice! Like gravel gargling in a rusty pipe, it was. I overheard him once arguing with a feller over a card game – though “arguing” is a tame word for what transpired. It was more like a demonstration of controlled menace, each syllable carefully weaponized. The feller, who started the conversation stout and proud, ended it looking like he'd just swallowed a lemon whole. Slade, he just pocketed the winnings and kept whittling, a faint smile playing on his lips that was colder than a winter’s morn. He wasn't a sociable sort, not by a long shot, but a man who demanded respect whether you liked him or not. It was a rough sort of respect, born of equal parts fear and grudging admiration, but respect nonetheless. And that, I suppose, in Mud Springs, was about as close to royalty as you were likely to get.
