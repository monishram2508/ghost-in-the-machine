Ballou, now there was a specimen fit to make a cat laugh. Picture, if you will, a man whose intellect struggled to outpace a particularly slow-moving tortoise, and you’ve got a fair rendering of Ballou. He arrived in Nevada with the wide-eyed innocence of a babe fresh from its swaddling clothes, utterly convinced he was destined to unearth a silver fortune so vast it would make Croesus blush. He bought into a mine so dry, so barren, that even a jackrabbit wouldn't be caught dead within a mile of it. Called it "The Lucky Strike," he did, with a straight face and a fervor that bordered on the comical. I recall him boasting about how he could smell the silver ore, claiming it had a distinct aroma like…well, I can't recall what he said it smelled like, because frankly, whatever it was, it wasn’t silver.

His mining techniques were a sight to behold. He’d consult divining rods, dream interpretations, and the phases of the moon before even thinking about swinging a pickaxe. And when he *did* swing, heavens to Betsy, it was a spectacle. He'd hit the rock with all the grace of a drunken mule kicking a barrel, usually missing his mark by a country mile and nearly amputating a limb in the process. He brought to the table such enthusiasm it was enough to move mountains, just not rock ones, more like mountain of sandwiches, Ballou sure did like his lunches. 

The man was perpetually optimistic, bless his heart. Even after weeks of fruitless digging yielded nothing but dust and disappointment, he'd declare, "We're just one swing away, boys! One swing from striking it rich!" I suspect he meant one swing from collapsing the whole darn tunnel on top of us, but I admired his spirit, even if it was hopelessly misguided. He was a living, breathing testament to the enduring power of human delusion, a walking, talking example of why they say a fool and his money are soon parted. A man's man, if that man's best quality was to be funny rather than clever.
