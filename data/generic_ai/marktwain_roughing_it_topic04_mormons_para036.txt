The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormonism, originated in the United States in the early 19th century with Joseph Smith Jr., who claimed to have received visitations from God the Father and Jesus Christ, as well as angelic visitations that led him to the discovery of ancient golden plates. These plates, Smith said, were translated into the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible by members of the church. The core belief of Mormons centers on Jesus Christ as the central figure in salvation, and they adhere to traditional Christian tenets such as the atonement, resurrection, and the importance of faith, repentance, and baptism. However, their theology diverges from mainstream Christianity in several key areas, including the nature of God, the concept of continuing revelation, and the potential for humans to progress towards godhood.

The Mormon faith emphasizes family, community, and service. They have a strong missionary program, with young adults dedicating up to two years of their lives to proselytizing around the world. The church also promotes a strict moral code that includes abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, as well as adherence to the law of chastity. The family unit is considered paramount, and temple marriage, which is believed to extend into eternity, is highly valued. Socially, Mormons are known for their strong work ethic, emphasis on education, and involvement in charitable activities. The church's organizational structure is hierarchical, with local congregations reporting to regional and then to the central leadership in Salt Lake City, Utah. The church has faced historical controversies, including the practice of polygamy in the 19th century, which was officially discontinued in 1890. Despite past and present criticisms, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown significantly and has a global presence, with millions of members worldwide.
