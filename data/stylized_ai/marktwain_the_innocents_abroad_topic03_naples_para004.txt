Naples, ah, Naples! A city that sits upon the Bay like a beggar king upon his throne, all tattered finery and bold pronouncements. I spent a fortnight there, and by Jove, I think I’ve aged a decade. The streets, you see, are a marvel of disorganized energy, a veritable circus of donkey carts, sputtering motorini, and pedestrians who appear to have wagered their lives on the speed of their footfalls. One might think a riot was constantly in progress, only to discover it’s merely Tuesday afternoon. The Neapolitan, blessed soul, possesses a singular talent for conversing at a volume suitable for a small artillery barrage, and a fondness for gesticulation that would make a windmill envious. They say the language is melodic; I say it sounds like a beautiful argument perpetually simmering.

And the food! Let us speak of the food, for therein lies a salvation. Pizza, yes, the birthright of kings, served in portions that defy mortal capacity and at prices that mock the very notion of extravagance. I ate so much pizza I feared I might sprout mozzarella on my chest. But beware, friend, for the street vendor's promises are as slippery as a greased pig. I bought what was advertised as the finest gelato in Christendom, only to find it tasted suspiciously of yesterday’s melted snow. Ah, but such is Naples: a glorious collision of the sublime and the ridiculous, the sacred and the profane. One moment you’re gazing upon a masterpiece in a crumbling church, the next you’re dodging a rogue watermelon being hurled from a balcony. It's a city of contrasts so stark, so utterly bonkers, that one can't help but be both exasperated and utterly charmed. Leave your sensibilities at the door, and prepare to be utterly, thoroughly, gloriously bamboozled. You'll come away either a raving lunatic or utterly smitten, there is no in-between with Naples.
