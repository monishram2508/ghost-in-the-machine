The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, traces its origins to the visions of Joseph Smith in the early 19th century. Smith claimed to have been visited by God and Jesus Christ, and later by an angel named Moroni, who directed him to golden plates containing ancient writings. Smith translated these plates, producing the Book of Mormon, which Mormons consider scripture alongside the Bible. The foundational narrative revolves around God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas, offering a unique perspective on the history of Christianity and humanity. Early Mormons faced significant persecution, due in part to their unique doctrines, including the practice of polygamy (which was officially discontinued by the Church in 1890). This persecution led them westward, ultimately settling in the Salt Lake Valley under the leadership of Brigham Young.

Central to Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, the idea that God still communicates with humankind through prophets. They believe in the importance of family, both in this life and in the afterlife, and perform temple ordinances, including baptisms for the dead, to extend these blessings to deceased ancestors. Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often dedicating two years of their lives to spreading the faith globally. The Church has a strong emphasis on community, providing social support and resources to its members. Furthermore, it advocates for a specific lifestyle emphasizing healthy living, abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, and adherence to a strict moral code. The Church also engages in extensive humanitarian work, providing aid to communities around the world impacted by natural disasters and poverty. While the Church has faced controversy and scrutiny throughout its history, it has grown into a significant global religion with a distinct culture and theology, actively involved in civic life and striving to promote its values of faith, family, and service.
