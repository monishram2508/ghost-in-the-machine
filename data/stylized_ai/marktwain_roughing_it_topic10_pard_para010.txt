Pard, you say? Now there’s a word that’ll fetch you a memory quicker than a six-shooter in a poker game gone sour. “Pard.” It ain't just a shortened “partner,” no sir. It’s a whole blasted philosophy wrapped up in a single syllable, and seasoned with a healthy dose of necessity. Out here in the territories, a fella learns quick that blood’s thicker than water, sure, but good company and a steady hand with a rope are often thicker than blood anyhow. You'd be out wandering amongst those endless sagebrush flats otherwise.

Take Hank, bless his simple soul. Now, Hank weren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, truth be told. I reckon he could get lost in a one-room cabin. Still, Hank was my pard. Shared a tin of beans with him under a sky so big it’d make your head spin. He once tried to teach a prairie dog to fetch, honest to goodness. Utter failure, mind you, but the commitment! That's the kind of fool thing a pard will share with you, when there's nothing else left besides the dry wind and the buzzards circling overhead. 

A pard's someone who'll call you out when you’re being a blasted idiot, but will still stand between you and a grizzly later that evening, though maybe he'd stand behind you, because, bears. A pard ain’t always sunshine and roses, neither. There'll be squabbles over who gets the last swig of whiskey, or whose turn it is to muck out the stable. But when the chips are down, and you’re staring down the barrel of something nasty – be it a rattler, a band of outlaws, or just plain ol' despair – a pard's the one you want by your side. Might not be able to save your hide, but he'll share the misery with ya as it's getting eaten off. And that, my friend, out here in this God-forsaken land, is worth more than all the gold in California, I say. Sometimes even worth a bottle of whisky.
