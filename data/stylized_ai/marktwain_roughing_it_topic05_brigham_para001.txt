Brigham, that singular man, was a sight to behold, a veritable human monument carved not from granite, but from pure, unadulterated will and a healthy dose of what some folks called religious fervor. Others, less charitable, whispered of something more akin to masterful manipulation, but I ain’t one to cast stones at a man who built a city in the blasted desert, even if it smelled suspiciously like a kingdom in the making. He was a stout fellow, not handsome in the slightest, mind you, but possessed of an eye that could pierce the thickest skull and a voice that could charm a rattlesnake out of its skin, or, more likely, convince it to donate its rattle to the tithing fund.

Now, Brigham’s sermons were a grand affair, a mixture of scripture, homespun wisdom, and enough practical advice to shame a farmer’s almanac. He’d preach for hours, it seemed, on everything from irrigating crops to keeping the womenfolk happy, though I reckon some of the younger brethren found the latter to be a more challenging prospect than the former. And his wives! Good Lord, the man had more wives than hairs on a buffalo. It was said he knew each one by name, a feat that would tax the memory of a philologist, never mind a busy prophet juggling earthly and celestial affairs. Some whispered he had a numbering system, a secret ledger with footnotes and cross-references, but I never saw it myself.

The man ruled Salt Lake City like a benevolent, if somewhat autocratic, patriarch. He dictated everything, from the width of the streets to the price of flour, all with a straight face and the unwavering conviction that he was doing the Lord’s work. Whether he was right or wrong, I couldn’t say, but he certainly got things done. And that, in the wild, untamed West, was a rarer and more valuable commodity than gold dust, or even a good batch of whiskey, though I wouldn’t say that to Brigham’s face, unless I wanted to be assigned to the outer reaches of the territory, where the crickets outnumbered the souls ten to one. He was a curious mix of the sacred and the profane, a true American original, like a mountain range that rose suddenly and unexpectedly from the plains, a testament to the boundless audacity and the peculiar ingenuity of the human spirit, particularly when it’s mixed with a healthy dose of desert sun and divine inspiration.
