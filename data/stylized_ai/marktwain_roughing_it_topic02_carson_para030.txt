Carson City, you say? Well, I wouldn't call it a city so much as a collection of shacks huddled together for warmth against the howling Nevada wind. They're playing at civilization there, I reckon, but it’s more like a child dressing up in their pa's clothes and thinking they’re grown. Why, I saw a fellow there once try to order a sophisticated cocktail at a place they called a "saloon." Near choked the barkeep, I tell you. Poor fella looked like he'd been asked to whip up a soufflé with a pickaxe and a burro.

Now, they call it the capital, which is a right laugh. Imagine, this dusty little settlement, hardly more than a hiccup on the face of the desert, dictating the laws of the land! I suppose there’s some sort of government building there, all bricks and pomposity, trying its best to look important. But you could probably knock it down with a well-aimed sneeze. Truth be told, the real governing body in Carson is the Silver Queen saloon and whatever poker game's happening in the back room. Decisions are made there over spilled whiskey and marked cards, laws written on the backs of losing hands.

The folks there? Well, they're a mixed bag, like a miner's stew. You got your hopeful prospectors, dreaming of striking it rich and retiring to a palace back East. Then you got your broken-down miners, their dreams ground to dust by the unforgiving hills. Sprinkle in a few shifty-eyed gamblers, a gaggle of ladies who call themselves "actresses" (and might be if you squint just right), and a handful of politicians who look like they've been weaned on sour milk and you've got yourself Carson City. It's a place where a man can make a fortune in a day and lose it all before sundown, a place where dreams go to either soar or die a slow, dusty death. I wouldn't recommend settling down there unless you have a strong constitution and a hearty appreciation for the absurd. And maybe a loaded pistol, just in case.
