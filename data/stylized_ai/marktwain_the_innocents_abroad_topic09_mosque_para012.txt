Now, I reckon I’ve seen my share of buildings erected in the name of piety, from the gaudy cathedrals back East, boasting stained glass windows fit to blind a sinner, to the humble clapboard meeting houses where folks gather to sing hymns that would make a coyote howl with envy. But a mosque, now that’s a different kettle of fish altogether. It ain’t about shoving God down your throat with ornate carvings and fiery sermons. Oh no, it’s a quieter affair, a more… well, *restrained* demonstration of faith. I wandered into one in Constantinople, you see, quite by accident, mind you, whilst attempting to procure a decent cup of coffee (a task, I might add, nearly as challenging as finding an honest politician). 

Inside, it was all cool marble and intricate patterns that seemed to stretch on forever, like a geometrical nightmare that somehow managed to be rather soothing. No pews to make a man’s backside ache, just carpets soft enough to take a nap on, which, truth be told, I was sorely tempted to do after battling those Constantinople street vendors. And these fellas, they were all bowing and bobbing like a field of wheat in a gentle breeze, facing towards Mecca, I believe it was. Reminded me a bit of those synchronized swimmers, only less aquatic and significantly more reverent. Now, I didn’t understand a lick of what they were chanting, sounded a bit like a cat choking on a hairball if I'm to be honest, but there was a certain… peace to it all. No fire and brimstone, no threats of eternal damnation, just folks quietly going about their spiritual business. Makes you wonder if maybe they've stumbled upon a kinder, gentler God than some of those preachers back home are yammering about. It was an interesting experience, I must confess. Though I still prefer my coffee stronger than their prayers, and without quite so much kneeling.
