Well, now, a portiere. Eve don't know much 'bout these contraptions, bein' as how there weren't no doorways in the Garden to be curtained off. Imagine, no need for a bit o' stuff hung up to pretend you ain't peeking! But since expulsion, and the subsequent invention of houses and their necessary evils, such as doors (and husbands, for that matter), the portiere has become a curious fixture. I reckon some folks see it as a touch of grandeur, somethin' to impress the Joneses, like a peacock feather stuck in a chicken coop. Others, I suspect, use it to hide the fact they ain’t dusted behind the sofa in nigh on a decade. Adam, he once tried to fashion a portiere from fig leaves after a particularly embarrassing incident with a serpent and a shared apple. It weren’t a success. Shedding was the main issue, left us lookin’ like we was raising silkworms ‘stead o’ children.

The thing that tickles Eve the most about a portiere is the sheer audacity of it. Here you are, with walls and doors meant to provide privacy, yet you hang up a flimsy piece of fabric and expect it to do more? It's like tryin' to stop a flood with a handkerchief! Folks seem to think it adds a certain… mystery. A sort of "what secrets lie behind this velvet curtain?" I'll tell you what secrets: probably just more furniture, maybe a dust bunny family, and a husband snoring louder than a rogue thunderstorm. Still, there's a certain charm in the pretense. It's a little bit theatrical, a little bit silly, like puttin' on airs when you're really just wearin' last week's unmentionables. I guess we all need a little bit of theatre in our lives, even if it just consists of a heavy piece of fabric pretendin' to be a wall. And who am I to judge? Lord knows Eve's used a fig leaf or two to cover up a mistake or two in her time.
