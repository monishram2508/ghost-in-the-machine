Lucerne, bless its heart, is a town that tries, it truly does. Imagine a perfectly painted picture postcard come to life, only slightly faded around the edges from being exposed to the Swiss temperament. Now, that temperament, you see, is a thing to behold. They're a tidy folk, the Swiss, mind you. So tidy, in fact, that I wouldn’t be surprised if they measured the angles of the swan droppings on Lake Lucerne to ensure they comply with some municipal ordinance. Speaking of the lake, it’s a beaut, sparkling like a mischievous imp's eye under the alpine sun. And the swans! Dear Lord, the swans. Majestic creatures, to be sure, but I’ve a suspicion they’re in cahoots with the tourist board, posing just so for the cameras, knowing full well they’re the main attraction after the wooden bridge – the Kapellbrücke, which they are awfully proud of, what with its history and those painted panels telling tales of yore. Though, I confess, I spent more time dodging the pigeons vying for a piece of my stale bread than deciphering the intricacies of medieval warfare.

One can't swing a cat (not that one *should*, mind you, the Swiss would likely have a law against it) without hitting a clock shop. Clocks chiming and cuckooing with such alarming regularity that one starts to feel a peculiar sort of pressure to be precisely on time for everything, even aimless wandering. The mountains loom over the town like watchful grandfathers, their snowy peaks forever judging your sartorial choices. And the people? Well, they’re polite, excruciatingly so. It’s the politeness that’s almost unsettling. One feels as though they’re all secretly assessing your suitability for citizenship based on your proficiency in yodeling and your ability to pronounce "Fünfliber." Lucerne offers a certain charm, a sanitized, almost manufactured charm, like a perfectly sculpted ice sculpture that's just begging to melt away the moment you look away. You'll find yourself admiring it, undoubtedly, but whether you’ll truly *feel* it, well, that’s a question only the echoing cuckoo of a Swiss clock can answer.
