Now, about this mosque, this edifice dedicated to what they call Islam, a religion that seems to cause more fuss than a cat in a bathtub. I've seen 'em scattered across the globe, these mosques, some humble as a prairie dog's burrow, others grander than a steamboat palace on the Mississippi. But they all, bless their hearts, seem to have a dome perched atop like a half-swallowed egg, and a minaret sticking up, yearning to scratch the clouds – I reckon that's where the muezzin yells his pronouncements five times a day, likely rousing the lazy and annoying the pigeons. Inside, they're usually rather bare. No pews like our churches, mind you, just carpets aplenty. Seems a mite uncomfortable to sit on the floor for so long, but I suppose a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do to find his piece with the Almighty, even if it involves a crick in the back.

And the fuss they make about cleanliness! You'd think sin was a germ you could scrub away with enough elbow grease. They take their shoes off at the door, wash their feet, and generally behave like they're about to perform surgery, instead of simply offering a prayer or two. Not a bad thing, mind you, cleanliness, but one does wonder if the Lord Almighty worries over a speck of dust when He's got the whole universe to oversee. I've often thought it's a clever way to keep the carpets from smelling of unwashed feet, a practical solution dressed up in religious garb.

I've seen some fine craftsmanship in these mosques, carvings delicate as lacework, verses from their holy book written out in swirling script that looks like a swarm of caffeinated gnats. And the colours! Blues and greens and golds that would make a peacock blush. It's all very impressive, I grant you, but I can't help but think that the Lord, if He's got any sense of humour at all, probably prefers a good hearty laugh to all the glitter and grandeur. Still, I suppose it keeps the artisans employed, and that's never a bad thing in this topsy-turvy world. Besides, who am I to judge a man's house of worship? If it keeps him from robbing banks and kicking puppies, I say let him have his dome and his minaret and his carpet, and may he find whatever peace he's looking for. It seems a long journey just to find a space in a room to prostate oneself, but there’s no harm in people trying.
