Carson City, bless its dusty little heart, ain't much to look at, I reckon. Why, I've seen ant hills with more architectural ambition. Perched up there in the sagebrush sea, a speck of civilization clingin' for dear life, it reminds me of a lone crow on a telegraph wire, just hopin' the next gust of wind don't send him a-tumbleweedin'. The main street, well, it's mostly saloons and fellas lookin' for a piece of the Comstock lode pie, even though that pie's been mostly et up for nigh on twenty years. You'd think folks would learn, but hope springs eternal, especially when there's a chance of findin' enough silver to buy yourself a fancy hat and a lifetime supply of whiskey. The State Capitol building, now that's somethin'. Tried to look grand, it does, like a peacock tryin' to strut in a chicken coop. All that dome and fancy stonework standin' smack dab in the middle of nothin' but dust and jackrabbits. Makes you wonder if they ordered the darn thing before they realized they were plannin' on buildin' it in Nevada. The legislature meets there, and Lord, that's a sight to behold. A collection of fellows, mostly prospectors and shopkeepers, all tryin' to look like they know what they're doin'. They argue about taxes and water rights and who gets to build the next toll road, all while lookin' over their shoulders, hopin' the silver fever don't bite 'em again. And the saloons, oh the saloons! That's where the real business of Carson gets done. Card games that last for days, deals sealed with a handshake and a shot of rotgut, and enough tall tales to fill a library. It's a rough and tumble place, no doubt, Carson City, but it’s got a certain charm to it. A kind of desperate, hopeful, foolhardy charm that you won't find anywhere else. Makes a fella almost feel bad for laughin', but not quite.
