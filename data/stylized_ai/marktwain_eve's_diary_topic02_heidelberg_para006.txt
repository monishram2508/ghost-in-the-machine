Heidelberg! Ach, Heidelberg! A town so charming it practically begs you to forgive its relentless rain, which, I might add, seems to fall with the singular purpose of dampening the spirits of even the most enthusiastic tourist. One arrives expecting sun-drenched ruins and jolly students singing drinking songs, only to find oneself huddled under a dripping awning, watching the Neckar River swell like a particularly disgruntled goose. The castle, magnificent in its decay, looms above, a testament to time and the rather unneighborly proclivities of the French. It is a ruin, truly, but a ruin with a view, and one that manages to extract a handsome admission fee despite the lack of a roof.

And the students! Bless their rosy cheeks and boundless energy. They are, without a doubt, the lifeblood of the place, though I confess I found their penchant for dueling scars more amusing than impressive. One fellow, quite proud of a particularly nasty gash, explained it with such gusto that I nearly applauded. It seems proving one’s mettle involves more than just passing examinations these days. Their customs are…well, they are certainly customs. I witnessed a "Kneipe" crawl that began with a solemn oath and ended, hours later, with several young men serenading a streetlamp with off-key renditions of what I believe were patriotic odes.

The Hauptstrasse, that endlessly winding pedestrian street, is a study in contrasts. On the one hand, you have the tourists, myself included, snapping pictures and gawking at the medieval architecture. On the other, you have the locals, navigating the throng with the grim determination of salmon swimming upstream. There are shops selling cuckoo clocks that sound suspiciously like dyspeptic birds, and stalls overflowing with gingerbread hearts sweeter than a politician’s promise. One can purchase anything, from a miniature beer stein to a full suit of armor (though I advise against the latter unless you plan on participating in a medieval jousting tournament, which, to my knowledge, are not currently on the city’s calendar). All in all, Heidelberg is a delightful jumble of history, absurdity, and dampness. It is a place where one can simultaneously admire the grandeur of the past and chuckle at the oddities of the present. Just bring an umbrella, and perhaps a flask of something to ward off the chill – you’ll thank me later.
