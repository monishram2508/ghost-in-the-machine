Zermatt, ah, Zermatt! A village perched so high amongst the Alps, it seemed as if it were trying to shake hands with the very heavens. One arrived, naturally, by train, for the impudence of the internal combustion engine is forbidden in this pious, mountain-kissed place. A noble sentiment, one supposes, though it did make one wonder how the citizenry managed to import all the necessary fripperies and necessities. Perhaps a secret underground tunnel, humming with the devil's own horsepower? One suspects the Swiss are capable of anything, bless their industrious little hearts.

The place itself? A pretty enough collection of chalets, all gingerbread trim and tidy flowerboxes, clinging to the mountainside like determined ivy. The air, of course, was so pure it felt almost aggressively clean. One felt quite obligated to indulge in a good cigar just to redress the balance. The centerpiece, of course, was the Matterhorn, that jagged, tooth-like mountain that seemed to sneer down at the mere mortals milling about its base. Postcards hardly did it justice; it was far more imposing, and dare I say, a touch intimidating, in person. 

Then there were the tourists, a veritable smorgasbord of nationalities and sartorial offenses. The English, naturally, were present in force, sunburned and earnestly attempting to speak German. The Americans, bless their souls, were easily spotted by their brightly colored parkas and unwavering enthusiasm, shouting greetings across the street as if they'd stumbled upon long-lost relatives. The Japanese, meanwhile, documented every single pinecone with an impressive array of photographic equipment. One felt quite sorry for the poor Matterhorn; imagine having one’s portrait taken that often! 

And the prices, good heavens, the prices! One suspected they were calibrated to extract every last franc from the unsuspecting tourist. A simple cup of coffee could set one back the price of a small mule, and a fondue dinner? Let’s just say one might be better off purchasing a small plot of land instead. Yet, despite the throng of humanity and the exorbitant costs, there was a certain charm to Zermatt. A rustic elegance, perhaps, or maybe just the intoxicating combination of fresh air and breathtaking scenery. One might even be tempted to return, provided one remembered to pack a good supply of cigars and a healthy sense of humor.
