Now, this Coliseum, mind you, wasn’t like your everyday, garden-variety amphitheater, no sir. It was a proper spectacle, a colossal cake of stone and arched corridors that made even the most seasoned traveler gawk like a rube at a three-legged dog. Built, they say, by Emperors with more ego than sense, it stood there, a hulking testament to the Roman knack for both grand design and utter barbarity. Imagine, if you will, a bowl big enough to hold the entirety of Poughkeepsie, and then fill it with lions, tigers, and gladiators itching for a bit of mortal combat.

I confess, I wandered through those ancient passages, the ghosts of emperors and roaring beasts whispering in my ear, and I couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. Here was mankind, at its most civilized and its most savagely uncivilized, all rolled into one dusty, bloodstained arena. They flocked there by the thousands, these Romans, eager to witness the shedding of blood, the crunch of bone, the spectacle of death. It was the sort of entertainment that would make even a backwoods minstrel show blush. And they called it progress!

One can't help but wonder what these fine folks would have thought of our modern amusements – the vaudeville, the nickelodeons, perhaps even a good old-fashioned game of lawn bowling. Would they be appalled by the lack of bloodshed, or would they see a similar, albeit diluted, craving for excitement, for a distraction from the humdrum monotony of life? Perhaps, at the heart of it all, we’re not so different from those toga-clad fellows after all, just exchanging swords for popcorn and lions for poorly-trained poodle acts. A thought that, I confess, makes me shudder a bit, like a mule caught in a hailstorm.
