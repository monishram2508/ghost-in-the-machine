Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked hides, are a curious lot. They roam about the Arabian deserts like tumbleweeds with opinions, their tents pitched one day and gone the next, leaving nary a trace save for maybe a disgruntled camel and a few scattered date pits. You'd think a life spent dodging sandstorms and arguing with livestock would make a fellow grumpy, but generally, they're hospitable enough. Mind you, hospitable in the Bedouin sense, which involves offering you a thimbleful of coffee strong enough to wake the dead, and then trying to sell you a slightly used rug that's probably older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. They're masters of the hard bargain, these fellas. I once saw a Bedouin convince a tourist that sand was a rare and valuable commodity, and nearly got away with charging him a king's ransom for a bucketful!

Their clothing, you see, is wonderfully practical. Loose robes that billow like sails in a gale, keeping them cooler than a cucumber in a snowdrift. And the headdresses! A veritable fashion statement, all stripes and patterns, designed, I suspect, to confuse the flies and intimidate potential carpet-baggers. As for their diet, well, let's just say they're intimately acquainted with the date palm. It's a wonder they haven't sprouted roots themselves, living on dates, camel milk, and the occasional locust when times get tough. They're fierce warriors, too, or so they claim. I've yet to see one actually engage in a proper dust-up, mind you, but they certainly know how to glare menacingly and brandish a rusty scimitar. And their stories! Oh, the tales they tell! Of ancient kings, of djinn, of buried treasure and camels who can talk. All spun with such earnestness that you're almost tempted to believe every word, even the bit about the sand that turns to gold at midnight. Though, I suspect if that were true, they wouldn't be bothering with the rug sales. Just a thought.
