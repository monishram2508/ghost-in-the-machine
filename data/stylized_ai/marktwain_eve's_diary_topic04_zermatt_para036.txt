Zermatt, you see, is not like those other Swiss villages, oh no. It’s got this air of importance, this…dare I say, self-satisfied smugness, like a cat who’s just swallowed the canary and is now grooming itself with excruciating, theatrical slowness. The mountains, of course, are magnificent; truly, they’re trying their best to outdo each other in sheer, ridiculous grandeur. The Matterhorn, that pointy-headed fellow, stands there like a particularly haughty professor, constantly lecturing you on the beauty of glacial erosion and the folly of human ambition. One almost expects him to clear his throat and ask for silence while he delivers a particularly pointed anecdote about a climber who dared to underestimate his majesty.

And then there are the tourists, a motley crew indeed! They’re all wrapped up in more layers of clothing than an onion in a crisis, sporting sunglasses the size of saucers, and trekking poles that look suspiciously like they were swiped from a wizard’s arsenal. They’re snapping pictures of everything, even each other, with the dedication of a dog burying a bone. One imagines the poor souls back home, later forced to endure hours of slideshows showcasing the breathtaking *sameness* of every snow-covered peak and charmingly rustic chalet.

The town itself is a charming enough little place, mind you, a perfect stage for this grand spectacle of tourism. No motorized vehicles allowed, you see. Only electric carts, gliding silently through the streets like ghostly apparitions. One can almost hear them whisper, "Luxury... Exclusivity... More cheese fondue?" You will find shops overflowing with watches that cost more than a small village, chocolates that look far too beautiful to eat (though one bravely manages to overcome the moral quandary, I assure you), and enough cowbells to summon the entire bovine population of Switzerland for a very noisy concert. Yes, Zermatt is a place of breathtaking beauty and staggering expense, a combination that, in its own peculiar way, is utterly and delightfully absurd.
