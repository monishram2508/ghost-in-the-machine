I confess, I’ve always harbored a sneaking admiration for the chamois, bless their nimble-footed souls. Not that I’ve ever had the pleasure of a formal introduction, mind you. One doesn't simply ring the bell of a chamois residence and inquire about tea. They reside, these creatures, in the Alps, a region so confoundedly vertical it gives one palpitations merely to consider it. They cling, these chamois, to precipices where even the angels fear to tread, apparently without a care in the world. Except, of course, for the eagles, who I imagine regard them as nothing more than particularly mobile and inconveniently located hors d'oeuvres.

Now, I've read accounts of men who risk life and limb, practically gluing themselves to mountainsides, for the sole purpose of bagging one of these beasts. Utter folly, if you ask me. Why, I wouldn’t climb a flight of stairs for the finest cut of chamois, let alone a sheer cliff face. Such dedication to obtaining a bit of meat strikes me as a particularly elaborate form of self-inflicted torment. And for what? A meal, I am told, that is often tough as shoe leather and gamey enough to make a buzzard turn up its beak. It seems a rather poor return on investment, considering the potential for irreversible rearrangement of one’s vital organs during the acquisition process.

Of course, there are those who claim it’s not about the meat at all. It's about the sport, the challenge, the conquering of nature. Poppycock, I say. Conquering nature is best achieved with a well-stocked pantry and a comfortable chair. Let the chamois have their mountain, I say. I'm content enough to admire them from afar, preferably with a healthy distance and a strong beverage in hand. Besides, I suspect they're laughing at us anyway, these sure-footed buffoons, as we scramble and sweat and risk our necks for a fleeting taste of something they consider perfectly ordinary. That, my friends, is the true comedy of the chamois.
