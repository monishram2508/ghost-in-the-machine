And then there's the chamois, bless its nimble little heart. I saw one once, or thought I did, clinging to a cliff face in the Alps like a stubborn burr on a mule's flank. It was so far up, I swear it looked more like a particularly audacious dust bunny contemplating the world's unfairness. Of course, Adam, ever the literalist, insisted it *was* a chamois, a creature apparently built for defying gravity and common sense. Said they eat mountain flowers, which struck me as a frightfully dull diet, though I suppose variety isn't much of a concern when you're busy not plummeting to your doom.

Adam, you see, has a fondness for categorizing things. He'd insist on knowing the precise genus and species, and then launch into a lecture about their evolutionary adaptation to the unforgiving terrain, when all I wanted to do was admire the sheer audacity of any beast willing to make its living hanging sideways on a rock. Makes a body ache just to think about it. I suspect their mothers tell them stories about the level ground, just to scare them straight. "Eat your dandelions, little ones, or you'll end up on the flat, surrounded by… sheep!"

And then there's the leather they make from them. “Chamois leather,” they call it, which sounds ever so much more refined than "goat-ish hide rubbed down to a soft sheen." The vanity of Man knows no bounds! He'll name something after the poor creature he’s skinned and then brag about how absorbent it is. The whole enterprise is a trifle barbaric, if you ask me, though I admit a good chamois cloth does wonders for polishing a girl's looking glass. Still, it seems rather like thanking the pig for its ham before devouring it with gusto. It’s a flawed system, dear reader, this world of ours, a flawed system indeed.
