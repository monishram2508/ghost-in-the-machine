Naples, ah, Naples! A city so draped in history and squalor that it quite takes the breath away, much like a hearty whiff of yesterday's refuse simmering under the Italian sun. I've seen cities of grandeur, mind you, cities where the pavements gleam and the beggars plead in hushed tones, but Naples? Naples assaults the senses with the unrestrained gusto of a Neapolitan tenor hitting a high note after a particularly robust plate of pasta. The laundry, bless its colorful, flapping heart, hangs thicker than the intrigues of the Borgias, strung between balconies so close, one suspects the residents borrow sugar from each other with a fishing rod and a strategically placed cup. And the traffic! Lord have mercy on the unwary tourist who dares to venture across a street, for the drivers operate under a set of rules known only to themselves and possibly a particularly well-connected saint. The horns blare like a symphony of the damned, each beep a declaration of impending doom or, more likely, an expression of mild impatience. 

One cannot help but admire the Neapolitan spirit, however. They possess a certain... devil-may-care attitude toward life that is both baffling and strangely endearing. They are, after all, masters of improvisation, able to turn a simple transaction into a theatrical performance worthy of the grand opera house. And the food! The pizza, my friends, is a religious experience, a culinary miracle performed daily in ovens that have surely witnessed the rise and fall of empires. One bites into that molten cheese and crisped crust and understands, at least for a fleeting moment, why chaos reigns supreme in this magnificent, maddening, and utterly unforgettable city. It's a place where the sacred and the profane dance a perpetual tango, and one suspects that even the angels look down from heaven with a mixture of amusement and a healthy dose of trepidation. Yes, Naples, a city that will leave you smelling of exhaust fumes, feeling slightly lighter in the purse, and with a story or two fit to make your grandchildren blush. A bargain, I say, a veritable bargain!
