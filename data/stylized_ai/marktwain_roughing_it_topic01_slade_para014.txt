Slade, now there was a town. Or rather, what some folks charitably called a town. More like a collection of shacks clinging to the side of the mountains, like ticks on a mangy hound dog. I reckon you could have walked from one end of it to the other whilst whistling “Buffalo Gals” and not needed to take a breath. The only thing stretching further than the main street was the tall tales spun in the saloon. Now, that saloon, the “Golden Gulch,” that was the true heart of Slade, beating loud with the clatter of cards, the thud of whiskey glasses, and the occasional, if I'm honest, fistfight.

They said Slade was built on silver. More like built on dreams of silver, and fueled by hard liquor and dashed hopes. I saw miners there with faces like maps of the earth, each wrinkle a story of a claim staked, a vein played out, and another prospect gone bust. Prospecting, you see, is a curious business. A fella can spend years chasing after riches, only to end up richer in blisters and regrets than in silver dollars. And let me tell you, there were plenty of fellas in Slade richer in blisters and regrets.

The only flourishing business in town, besides the Golden Gulch, of course, was the undertaker’s. Seemed like nature, or perhaps the Golden Gulch’s potent moonshine, was thinning the population out almost as fast as new faces arrived, dreaming of striking it rich. The undertaker, a gaunt fella named Mr. Grimshaw, always had a twinkle in his eye and a morbid joke on his lips, like death was just another commodity to be traded. Said his motto was "Why go on living when you can be embalmed?" I tell you, that Grimshaw, he had a dark humor, enough to make even a buzzard feel gloomy. Still, business was good, so I guess he wasn’t complaining. Course, he probably wasn't doing much complaining either, six feet under. Just goes to show, there is something morbidly humorous in most towns, you just have to look at the right profession.
