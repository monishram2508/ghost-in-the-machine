Now, about this chamois, dear Diary. It’s a creature that, I reckon, has caused more consternation than a preacher at a saloon. Why, the very word sounds like a sneeze caught halfway, doesn't it? But I digress. They reside, these four-legged mountaineers, in the most confoundedly precipitous regions of Europe, leaping about with a grace that would make a ballet dancer blush. Imagine, if you will, a goat that’s been struck with a sudden ambition to emulate a bird, but then decided leather britches were still more practical than wings. They’re all muscle and horn and a certain suspicious glint in their eye that suggests they’re perpetually contemplating the best route down a cliff face to deliver a well-aimed hoof-kick to a bothersome tourist.

The fellas are particularly eager to make a grand display of themselves during mating season. Lord have mercy, the ruckus! I’ve heard tell they’ll charge each other, horns clashing with a sound like crockery falling down stairs, all for the affection of a doe who’s likely unimpressed and mainly concerned about finding a patch of grass that hasn't been nibbled to dust. It’s a ridiculous show, really. Men are like that though, I suppose, always making a spectacle of themselves to try and prove they’re the alpha – whether it's with a fancy necktie, a big stack of poker chips, or a perfectly executed headbutt on a rocky incline. And, of course, they’re hunted, for the sheer sport of it, or for their hide, which, as you know, Dear Diary, is used to polish carriages and spectacles, and no doubt, a few self-satisfied monocles. I can’t help but feel a smidge of sympathy for them, even if they do look perpetually annoyed, they’re just trying to make a living, and raise some kids, and not fall off a mountain. Just like the rest of us, ain't it?
