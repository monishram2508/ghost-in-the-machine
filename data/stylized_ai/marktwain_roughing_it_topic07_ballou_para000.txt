Ballou, now there was a specimen of humanity fit to be stuffed and mounted, or better yet, used as a cautionary tale. He was a lawyer, of sorts, though I use the term with the same trepidation one might use the term “gold mine” when standing next to a gopher hole in the desert. He’d drifted west, like a tumbleweed full of good intentions and a singular lack of talent, seeking fortune and renown, and finding instead mostly tumbleweeds and the occasional bewildered jackrabbit. Ballou fancied himself a silver-tongued orator, a second Demosthenes come to the Nevada territories. Trouble was, his tongue seemed to be permanently glued to the roof of his mouth, and whatever silver was in his voice was heavily tarnished with rust and a distinct aroma of stale whiskey.

He’d try to impress the local miners with grandiloquent pronouncements on the finer points of jurisprudence, usually ending up tying his tongue in knots that would have baffled a seasoned sailor. One time, I swear, he quoted Blackstone backwards, then blamed it on the altitude. The miners, bless their simple hearts, mostly took pity on him, figuring he was just addled from too much sun and not enough sense. He took to following me and Mr. Brown around, like a lost pup trailing a wagon train, convinced we were on the verge of striking it rich. He’d offer legal advice, unsolicited and usually incoherent, about claims and deeds and water rights, none of which we understood nor particularly wanted to. We tried to discourage him, of course, short of outright abandonment, but Ballou was a persistent creature, fueled by an unshakeable belief in his own brilliance, a characteristic not entirely uncommon out West, though rarely so unjustified. He was a man of great potential, no doubt, potential to be a first-rate clerk, or maybe, if he buckled down and applied himself, a passable bootblack. But a lawyer? Now, that’s a tall tale fit to be told beside a campfire under a sky full of fibs.
