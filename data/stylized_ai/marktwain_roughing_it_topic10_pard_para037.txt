 Pard, you say? Well, I'll tell you about pard. Pard was a fella I ran across out near Virginia City, claiming to be a prospector, though he looked more like a stray dog that'd been caught in a dust devil and spat out. Had one of those faces, all pinched and squinty, like he’d been sucking on lemons since he was a boy. Clothes looked like they'd been used as a doormat for a traveling circus. Claimed his name was Pardwick, but I suspicioned he’d picked that name out of a cracker barrel. Seemed fitting, somehow.

He was always jawing about striking it rich, this Pard was. Said he had a mine, just a little one, mind you, but full of silver so pure it’d blind a man. Of course, it was always just around the next bend, or over the next mountain, or wherever the hell he wasn't at that particular moment. He was a master of the future tense, Pard was. Always gonna do something, always gonna be rich, never quite actually doing or being.

Now, Pard wasn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer, if you catch my drift. One time, he tried to pay for a sarsaparilla with a rock he swore was a genuine diamond. It was about as diamond-y as a cow pie. The barkeep, a fella with a walrus mustache and a disposition to match, just about threw him out on his ear. Pard, bless his simple heart, just shrugged and said he’d "get him next time," flashing that rock like it was the Koh-i-Noor. 

He was always borrowing tobacco, Pard was. Never paid it back, either. Said he was saving up for blasting powder. Said he needed it to get to the motherlode. Seemed like he was always saving up for something, except maybe a bath. I figured his motherlode was a dry well full of fool's gold and unfulfilled promises, just like him. But he was harmless enough, Pard was. Just another one of those dreamers out in the West, chasing rainbows and shadows, looking for that pot of gold that probably wasn't there in the first place. And you know what? I kinda liked him for it.
