Lucerne, now there's a town calculated to charm the very teeth out of a tourist’s head, and then sell 'em back as souvenirs, painted with little Edelweiss. It sits there, nestled against the lake like a plump, contented tick on the flank of Mount Pilatus, sucking the lifeblood of unsuspecting travelers with its cuckoo clocks and picture-perfect chalets. Why, I wouldn't be surprised to learn they have a factory somewhere out back dedicated solely to manufacturing romantic sunsets, shipped in fresh every evening to guarantee a maximum return on investment. I observed a group of Americans, bless their trusting hearts, practically weeping at the sight of the Chapel Bridge, that rickety old tinderbox strung across the Reuss. They were snapping photographs like they were trying to capture the soul of the place, quite oblivious to the fact that half those paintings hanging from the rafters were likely commissioned last Tuesday, depicting battles that probably never even happened.

The whole spectacle is, as Eve might say, a delightful concoction of truth and artifice, like a perfectly iced cake that hides a whole lotta nothin' but air underneath. You see the locals gliding about in their well-worn finery, looking for all the world like characters from a stage play, and you half expect them to break into a spontaneous yodel at any moment. And the shops! Good heavens, the shops! They bulge with watches that cost more than a small farm, knives that could slice through time itself, and enough chocolate to sink a battleship. I swear, a body could get lost in a chocolate coma there, wake up six months later, and find they’ve been declared a national treasure, preserved for all eternity as a prime example of the Lucerne consumer. Still, despite its somewhat… theatrical tendencies, Lucerne has a certain undeniable charm. It's like a pretty woman wearing a frightful amount of rouge - you know it’s a performance, but you’re too polite (or too captivated) to say anything. And perhaps, just perhaps, there’s a genuine bit of beauty lurking beneath all that artful camouflage. Or perhaps I just bought too much chocolate.
