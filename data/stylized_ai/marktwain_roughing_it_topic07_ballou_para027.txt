Ballou, now there's a specimen worthy of observation, like a two-headed calf at a county fair, only less predictable, and twice as prone to unfortunate accidents. Came to these parts seeking fortune, or so he claimed, though fortune, I reckon, generally has more sense than to seek him out. He hailed from, well, somewhere back east, where they apparently cultivate a particularly peculiar brand of optimism that borders on sheer lunacy. He arrived looking like he'd swallowed a flagpole whole, ramrod straight and bristling with notions gleaned from dime novels and Sunday sermons. He fancied himself a prospector, a man of the soil, rugged and resourceful. In reality, he couldn’t tell quartz from a quail egg and managed to trip over a gopher hole with the grace of a newborn giraffe.

He latched onto me like a tick on a hound dog, convinced I possessed some arcane knowledge of the gold fields, which, to be fair, I probably do, only I ain't sharing it with a man who sets his beard on fire trying to boil coffee. Witnessed that myself, I did. Had to beat it out with a shovel, and he thanked me afterward, coughing up soot and grinning like a fool who'd just won the lottery. He's got that kind of spirit, Ballou does, a relentless, misguided enthusiasm that's equal parts endearing and infuriating.

He’s got a knack for attracting misfortune, that boy. Lost his mule to a flash flood, his pickaxe down a bottomless crevice, and his hat to a particularly cheeky magpie. Yet, he keeps on, digging and dreaming, convinced that tomorrow will be the day he strikes it rich. Honestly, I suspect he'll sooner discover the fountain of youth than a gold nugget, but you can't fault a man for dreaming, even when his dreams are fueled by equal parts delusion and desperation. Keeps things interesting, at least, having him around. Like watching a slow-motion train wreck you can't quite bring yourself to look away from. He’s a cautionary tale, Ballou is, but a damn entertaining one.
