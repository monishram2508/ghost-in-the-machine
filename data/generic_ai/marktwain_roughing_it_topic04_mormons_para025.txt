The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian denomination that originated in the United States during the 19th century. Joseph Smith Jr., the founder, claimed to have received visitations from God and Jesus Christ, as well as an angel named Moroni, who revealed the location of golden plates containing ancient scripture. Smith translated these plates, resulting in the Book of Mormon, which Latter-day Saints consider to be scripture alongside the Bible. This book narrates the story of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. A central tenet of Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, meaning that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets, just as he did in biblical times. The church emphasizes family values, community involvement, and a strong work ethic. Members often abstain from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, adhering to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom. Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving full-time missions, typically for two years, to proselytize and spread their beliefs around the world. Church services are generally simple, focusing on scripture study, prayer, and sermons. Temples, distinct from meetinghouses or chapels, are considered sacred spaces dedicated to performing special ordinances, such as baptisms for the dead and temple marriages, believed to bind families together eternally. Historically, the practice of polygamy, or plural marriage, was practiced by some early members, but it was officially discontinued by the church in 1890. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown significantly since its founding, with millions of members worldwide and a global presence, actively participating in charitable work, disaster relief efforts, and promoting their distinctive religious beliefs.
