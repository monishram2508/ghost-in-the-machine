Heidelberg, they call it a city, and I suppose it technically qualifies, though a more accurate description would be a collection of picturesque ruins clinging to the side of a rather formidable hill. And what ruins they are! A castle, or what's left of one, that looks as though a giant had a terrible tantrum and decided to disassemble it stone by stone, scattering the pieces about with magnificent abandon. One can almost hear the echoes of clanking armor and the boisterous laughter of long-dead princes, though I suspect those echoes are just the local students practicing their beer-drinking songs. The river Neckar, a rather agreeable stream, meanders lazily through the town, providing a scenic backdrop for countless artists attempting to capture the "romantic essence" of the place. One can't swing a cat, figuratively speaking of course – cruelty to animals is frowned upon, even in Heidelberg – without hitting an easel and a fellow struggling to tame the notoriously fickle light.

The townspeople are a curious lot. They possess a certain air of nonchalance, a sort of world-weary wisdom that suggests they've seen it all before, probably during the Thirty Years' War. They're remarkably tolerant of the hordes of tourists that descend upon them each year, their only outward sign of annoyance being a slightly raised eyebrow or perhaps a muttered complaint about the price of pretzels. And then there are the students, bless their youthful, perpetually underfunded hearts. They are the lifeblood of the town, filling the air with their spirited debates, their questionable fashion choices, and their unwavering commitment to the pursuit of higher education (and, one suspects, the pursuit of less-than-sober entertainment). All in all, Heidelberg is a place that grows on you, much like a particularly persistent vine. It's a delightful chaos of history, beauty, and good cheer, a place where even the most jaded traveler can find something to smile about, or at least something to write a mildly sarcastic travelogue about.
