A glacier is a colossal, slow-moving river of ice formed over centuries or even millennia from the accumulation and compaction of snow. Its birth begins in regions where snowfall consistently exceeds melting, typically in high altitudes or polar areas. As snow accumulates, the weight of the overlying layers compresses the lower layers, gradually transforming them into granular ice known as firn. Further compression over time squeezes out air pockets, increasing the density and transforming the firn into the solid, crystalline glacial ice we recognize. Glaciers aren’t static entities; they are dynamic systems constantly flowing under the immense pressure of their own weight. This movement, although often imperceptible to the naked eye, is driven by gravity and occurs through two primary mechanisms: internal deformation and basal sliding. Internal deformation involves the slippage of ice crystals past each other, while basal sliding occurs when a thin layer of water forms at the glacier's base, allowing it to slide over the underlying bedrock.

The size and shape of a glacier are determined by a complex interplay of factors, including temperature, precipitation, and the topography of the surrounding landscape. Glaciers can range from small cirque glaciers nestled in mountain hollows to vast ice sheets that cover entire continents, like those found in Antarctica and Greenland. As they flow, glaciers sculpt the land, carving out valleys, eroding bedrock, and transporting massive quantities of sediment. This erosive power is responsible for many of the dramatic landscapes we see today, including U-shaped valleys, fjords, and moraines. The terminus, or snout, of a glacier is the point where it ends, and its location is a sensitive indicator of climate change. If melting exceeds accumulation, the glacier retreats, shrinking in size and leaving behind evidence of its former extent in the form of glacial deposits. Conversely, if accumulation exceeds melting, the glacier advances, expanding its reach and reshaping the landscape. The meltwater released from glaciers feeds rivers and streams, providing essential water resources for many communities, but the accelerated melting of glaciers due to global warming poses a significant threat to these water supplies and contributes to rising sea levels.
