Now, concerning this mosque, which the heathens call a “place of submission,” though submission to what, precisely, remains a bit unclear. One finds them scattered about like stray cats in Constantinople, each vying for attention with minarets that pierce the heavens like so many pious daggers. They're often quite imposing, these mosques, all domes and arches and elaborate tilework, giving the impression that Allah, if He’s got any sense, must be a fellow with a decided taste for the opulent. Inside, it's all carpets thick enough to smother a donkey, and enough gold leaf to make Croesus blush. Of course, they are always filled with chaps kneeling and bobbing, muttering in a language that sounds suspiciously like a very fast auctioneer reciting the odds at a dogfight. I’ve seen more fervor in a poker game, but one mustn’t judge a book by its cover, especially if the cover is made of exquisitely carved teak. 

They say it’s a place of prayer, but I suspect a good deal of it is simple neighborly competition. Imagine, if you will, a village of farmers all trying to out-pious each other with louder Amens and more elaborate head-bobs. And of course, the sermons! Long, rambling affairs full of wise pronouncements that generally amount to “be good,” “give alms,” and "avoid eating pork, because, well, just trust us on this one." It’s enough to make a man long for the simple clarity of a well-told lie. Still, there’s a certain undeniable grandeur to it all, a certain sense of ancient mystery. One can't help but wonder what goes on behind those carved wooden doors, what secrets are whispered amongst the muezzin, and if the janitor ever gets tired of vacuuming all those carpets. It’s a curious institution, the mosque; a place where earthly extravagance meets heavenly aspirations, and where men, in their own peculiar way, seek to cut a deal with the Almighty.
