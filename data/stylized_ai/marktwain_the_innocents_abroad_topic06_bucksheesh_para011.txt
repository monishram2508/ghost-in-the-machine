Now, about this peculiar custom they have in the Orient, this "bucksheesh," as they call it. It's a marvel, a lubrication for the cogs of daily life, a grease applied liberally to the palms of men in positions of authority, or sometimes, authority's distant cousin, a mere fellow with a key or a nod to bestow. Imagine, if you will, trying to accomplish the simplest task without it – procuring a cup of tea, for instance. You might request it, and request it again, all the while the server affects a profound deafness, as if afflicted by a sudden desert-induced malady. But produce a coin, just a glint of silver nestled slyly in your palm, and suddenly, his hearing is restored, his memory refreshed, and you have not only your tea, but perhaps a sugared date on the side and a wink thrown in for good measure. It's akin to that old political maneuver back home, except instead of votes, you are exchanging paltry sums for expeditious service, or sometimes, simply for the privilege of not being unduly inconvenienced.

Of course, one must tread carefully. Overpay, and you’re a blithering fool, ripe for further exploitation; underpay, and you are a skinflint, cursed to wander the marketplace forever, forever seeking a donkey that will actually move forward. It's a delicate dance, this bucksheesh, a theatrical performance of assumed innocence on the part of the giver and feigned reluctance on the part of the receiver, all wrapped up in a layer of implied understanding. It is, without a doubt, a system that could drive a man mad, or perhaps, if he possesses a certain philosophical detachment and a healthy sense of humor, it could provide him with endless amusement. The whole affair has an element of low comedy, a slapstick ballet performed with rupees and grins. One almost expects a tiny clown to pop out of a teapot and take a bow. Yes, bucksheesh, a curious institution, and one that, I suspect, will long outlive our feeble attempts to understand, or even to describe it accurately.
