Damascus, ah, Damascus! A city so ancient, they say, that if its walls could talk, they’d bore you to death with tales older than Methuselah’s beard. I reckon even the Sphinx would be envious of its storied past, although, truth be told, the Sphinx just sits there with a perpetually constipated look on its face, so maybe not the best judge of character. I've heard tell that Abraham himself may have watered his camel at its oasis—though whether he haggled over the price is not recorded, which I consider a grave oversight on the part of the historical record. You see, everyone in this neck of the woods is a bit of a salesman at heart, keen to relieve you of a few extra shekels, dirhams, or whatever shiny trinkets they’re using for currency these days. The place is choked with more bazaars than a dog has fleas, each hawking silk scarves and inlaid boxes and hookahs that probably belonged to some Ottoman sultan, or at least that’s what they’ll try to convince you. The streets themselves are a labyrinth, narrow and twisting like a politician's promise, and filled with more dust than a forgotten attic. One can lose oneself quite easily, although frankly, I suspect that many of the locals would be perfectly happy to let you stay lost and wander in circles until you’re forced to buy them a cup of that tar-like coffee they brew. The air hangs heavy with the scent of spices, donkey dung, and the faint aroma of what I’m pretty sure was a dead rat I glimpsed in an alleyway. All in all, it’s a truly magnificent place, in a thoroughly dilapidated, slightly overwhelming, and utterly unforgettable sort of way. And don’t even get me started on the food. One bite of the Baba Ghanoush and you'll forget all your troubles, even if those troubles include the fact that you're currently being charged three times the normal price for it by a particularly charming rogue with a twinkle in his eye.
