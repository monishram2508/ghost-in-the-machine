Now, about this bucksheesh, this backsheesh, this baksheesh – a body could spend a lifetime just trying to spell the confounded thing, let alone figure out its ins and outs! It's a peculiar institution, you see, woven into the very fabric of the Orient like threads of gold (albeit tarnished gold, in some cases). They'll tell you it's a tip, a gratuity, a small token of appreciation for services rendered, and sometimes that's even true. But often, it's more like greasing the wheels of progress, or perhaps I should say, *avoiding* the grinding halt that progress is likely to take without it. You want a donkey to carry your luggage? Bucksheesh. You want the innkeeper to find you the best room, the one not already occupied by a family of nesting pigeons? Bucksheesh. You wish the police officer to ignore that somewhat dubious contraption you are importing? Bucksheesh, and mind you, a generous one.

It’s like a secret language, whispered in the rustle of banknotes, a silent acknowledgment of the unspoken agreement that exists between those who have and those who desire. And it's democratic, too, in its own peculiar way. From the lowliest water-carrier to the most bejeweled pasha, everyone expects, nay, *demands* their due. You might think, the pasha, with his mountains of riches, wouldn't stoop to such pettiness, but you'd be wrong. He’d probably just be miffed if you didn't offer, consider it a slight on his inherent magnificence.

Now, a greenhorn might find himself perpetually befuddled, trying to discern the appropriate amount to proffer, like a hound trying to catch a scent in a hurricane. Too little, and you’ll be met with sullen stares and sluggish service; too much, and you become a walking moneybag, ripe for exploitation. The savvy traveler, though, learns to navigate this murky world with a touch of humor and a well-worn pocket. He understands that bucksheesh is not merely bribery, but a social lubricant, a way of saying, "We're all in this together, trying to get by in a world full of dusty roads and stubborn donkeys." Though I confess, after a few weeks of navigating its currents, I longed for the simple honesty of an outright swindle. At least then you knew where you stood, even if you were standing knee-deep in muck.
