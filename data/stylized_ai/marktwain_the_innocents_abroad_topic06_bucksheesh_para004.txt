Now, concerning this matter of bucksheesh, a body might be forgiven for thinking it merely another one of those foreign affectations, like wearing a fez indoors or insisting on eating dates with the pits still inside. It is, in essence, a gratuity, a little something slipped into the palm of a man who has, allegedly, gone above and beyond the call of duty. Though, more often than not, the duty performed was something one could reasonably expect for the price already agreed upon, a bit of extra charm never hurt anyone, did it? But this “bucksheesh,” mind you, ain't your common, garden-variety tip offered to a barber for a particularly close shave. No, this is a system, a way of life, a lubricant that keeps the gears of commerce turning, though sometimes they squeak a bit louder than necessary, oiled as they are with piasters and effusive thanks.

One sees it everywhere, from the porter who suddenly discovers your luggage is impossibly heavy to the customs official whose eyesight miraculously improves upon the appearance of a folded bill. The whole thing is a grand pantomime, a delicate dance of implied obligations and barely concealed expectations. One almost admires the frankness of it, the way they dispense with the pretense that merit alone dictates reward. Back home, we cloak our own forms of "bucksheesh" in respectability, labeling them "commissions" or "bonuses" and pretending they are solely the product of hard work and ingenuity. Here, they call it what it is, an inducement, a gentle push to encourage promptness, efficiency, or, at the very least, a friendly smile. And one learns quickly to play the game, to master the art of the subtly placed coin, the knowing wink, the vocabulary of gestures that speaks louder than any carefully worded request. For without bucksheesh, one finds themselves stuck fast, like a cart wheel mired in mud, waiting for a kindly soul (with outstretched palm) to lend a helping hand, which makes a body wonder whether this "bucksheesh" is a burden, or rather a subtle form of blackmail.
