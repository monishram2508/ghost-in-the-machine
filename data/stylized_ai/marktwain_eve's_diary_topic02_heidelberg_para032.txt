Heidelberg, bless its romantic heart, perched precariously on the Neckar like a tipsy guest at a wedding feast. One expects any moment it might simply tumble into the river, scattering geraniums and besotted students in its wake. The castle, ah, the castle! They call it a ruin, and so it is, undoubtedly. But a ruin with aspirations, you understand. A ruin that considers itself still quite the society belle, thank you very much, despite missing a few teeth and sporting a rather fetching green moss shawl. It lords it over the town with a dignified air, as if to say, "Yes, I’ve seen better days, but have *you* hosted a royal ball lately?" And the students! Heavens, the students. They throng the streets with an enthusiasm that borders on the alarming, bellowing songs of questionable taste and brandishing steins the size of infants. They seem to believe that Heidelberg was built solely for their amusement, a giant stage upon which to enact their youthful dramas. One can’t help but admire their dedication to revelry, even if one does suspect that a good half of them are merely pretending to understand the lectures. And the famed student jail? A curious institution indeed. One locks oneself away for minor transgressions, it seems, only to scribble boastful graffiti upon the walls and receive visits from admiring tourists. It’s like a holiday camp for slightly rebellious scholars. Honestly, the whole affair reeks of a staged production, cleverly designed to lure gullible Americans, myself included, into believing that we are witnessing something profoundly authentic. But authentic or not, it's a charming spectacle, a veritable opera of beer and youthful indiscretion, all staged against a backdrop of crumbling grandeur and overflowing flower boxes. One leaves Heidelberg with a lingering fondness, a feeling that one has just narrowly escaped joining the chorus line of this delightful, slightly madcap, performance.
