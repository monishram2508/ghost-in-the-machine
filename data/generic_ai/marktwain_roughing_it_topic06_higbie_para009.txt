Higbie, a name often associated with naval history, specifically marks the location of Naval Air Station (NAS) Grosse Ile’s airfield, located on Grosse Ile, Michigan. This airfield played a significant role in World War II aviation training. Captain Hugh B. Higbie, a prominent figure in Detroit's automotive industry and a dedicated naval aviator, tragically lost his life in a plane crash in 1924. In recognition of his contributions and service, the airfield was named in his honor, becoming Higbie Flying Field. The naming served as a constant reminder of his commitment to aviation and the burgeoning field of naval air power.

Higbie Flying Field was instrumental in the development of naval aviation during a critical period. As war loomed, the Navy recognized the need for trained pilots, and Grosse Ile, strategically located near Detroit's industrial heartland, was selected as a site for a naval air station. Higbie Flying Field was incorporated into the larger NAS Grosse Ile complex, which became a hub for training naval aviators in carrier qualifications. Pilots trained rigorously, practicing take-offs and landings on simulated aircraft carrier decks, preparing them for the demanding conditions of combat at sea. The flat, open landscape of Grosse Ile provided an ideal training environment, allowing pilots to hone their skills in a relatively controlled setting before deploying to active war zones.

The legacy of Higbie extends beyond its physical presence as a training airfield. It symbolizes the spirit of innovation and dedication that characterized the early days of naval aviation. The station contributed significantly to the Allied war effort by producing well-trained pilots who went on to serve in the Pacific and European theaters. After the war, NAS Grosse Ile, including Higbie, was deactivated, eventually transitioning to civilian use. However, the memory of Higbie persists, a testament to Captain Higbie's sacrifice and the pivotal role the airfield played in shaping the future of naval aviation during a time of global conflict. Historical markers and local museums continue to preserve the story of NAS Grosse Ile and Higbie, ensuring that its contribution to the nation's defense is not forgotten.
