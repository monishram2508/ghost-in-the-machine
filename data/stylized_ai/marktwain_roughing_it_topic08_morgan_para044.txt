Now, Morgan, there was a specimen and a half. Claimed he hailed from back East, somewhere nigh onto Boston, but I reckon he'd spent more time dodging responsibility than attending proper schoolin'. Showed up in Virginia City lookin' like a stray dog that’d been through a tumbleweed convention. Clothes torn, face grime-caked enough to fertilize a potato patch, and a smile that could charm a rattlesnake clean out of its skin. Said he was a "prospector of fortune," which in these parts usually translated to a prospector of free meals and borrowing privileges. 

He wasn't exactly honest, mind you. Not dishonest in a villainous, claim-jumpin’ sort of way, but dishonest like a fox is dishonest – just naturally good at it. He could spin a yarn that'd make Baron Munchausen blush, full of encounters with grizzly bears that spoke fluent French and gold nuggets the size of watermelons. Believed about half of it himself, I suspect. Never struck it rich, Morgan didn't. Spent most days "assessing the potential" of various saloons and strategizing methods of acquiring the next drink. He had a knack for finding lost items – provided those items were unattended and happened to be in close proximity to his person. 

Yet, the feller was perpetually upbeat. Had a resilience that’d shame a jackrabbit. One time he swore he'd discovered a new mineral – called it "Morganite," naturally – that was worth more than silver, or gold. Turns out it was just fool's gold dipped in axle grease, but he tried to sell it to the assayers anyway, bless his optimistic heart. Never did figure out how he survived, but he did. He'd show up every day, somehow managing to scrape by. A charmer, a rascal, and a liar to be sure, but he was our liar, and this town ain't been the same since he drifted off to some new corner of the world to try his luck. Probably telling some unsuspecting souls about them watermelons made of gold right now.
