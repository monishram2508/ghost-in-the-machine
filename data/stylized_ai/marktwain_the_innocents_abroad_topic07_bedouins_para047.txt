Now, these Bedouins, bless their wandering souls, are a breed apart, I tell you. Picture them if you will, draped in yards of fabric that would make a dry-goods merchant weep with envy, perpetually squinting at a sun that seems to have a personal vendetta against anything not sand-colored. They roam these blasted deserts like so many tumbleweeds with a purpose, though precisely what that purpose is remains, after several centuries of observation, a bit of a mystery to me. One might think they are searching for water, and sometimes, bless their hearts, they actually are! But often it seems more like they’re just following the sheep – a notoriously unreliable compass, if you ask me, being driven more by appetite than any sort of navigational acumen.

They possess camels, of course, those ship-of-the-desert monstrosities. Now, I’ve had dealings with mules that were more agreeable. A camel, you see, seems to hold you personally responsible for its predicament, which mostly involves being hot and thirsty. It regards you with a disdain that could curdle milk, and if given half a chance, will happily deposit you in the nearest sand dune. And the smell! It's a fragrant blend of sun-baked wool, unwashed camel, and a hint of what I can only describe as existential despair. 

As for their conversation, it’s a glorious, roundabout affair, full of proverbs and tales that stretch back to the dawn of time. Trying to get a straight answer from a Bedouin is like trying to nail jelly to a wall. You'll likely hear about the great-grandfather's sister's camel thief before you ever discover the whereabouts of the nearest well. But confoundedly charming in their own way, they are. Offer them tea, though, and watch their eyes light up. You will suddenly be best of friends. Perhaps that is their true purpose, you see: to travel the land, spread great stories, and to show the importance of a good cup of tea. And that's something any man, no matter how civilized, can understand.
