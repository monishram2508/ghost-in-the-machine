Now, about this Morgan, you see, a fellow I encountered out in Nevada, where even the jackrabbits wear six-shooters just for show. He was a specimen, alright, a walking, talking contradiction wrapped up in a dusty serape and a perpetual squint. Claimed he was a prospector, though the only thing he seemed to prospect for was shade under a lonely Joshua tree and a stiff drink at the nearest saloon. This Morgan, you understand, was one of those men who could spin a yarn thicker than a grizzly bear's hide, and just as hairy. He’d regale you with tales of lost mines brimming with silver, Indian curses older than Methuselah, and adventures that made Baron Munchausen sound like a shy schoolboy.

Whether a word of it was gospel truth, I couldn't rightly say. He could have been lying through his teeth, but bless my boots if he wasn’t entertaining about it! He had a way of embroidering a simple fact into a tapestry of pure imagination, sprinkled with enough 'hoss sense' to almost convince you it was possible. He'd swear he wrestled a mountain lion for its gold fillings, or that he once taught a coyote to sing grand opera; and you'd be sitting there, shaking your head, knowing full well he was pulling your leg, but laughing fit to bust a gut all the same.

He was a study in contrasts, was Morgan. He’d preach about the virtues of honesty and hard work while simultaneously trying to convince you to invest in a 'sure thing' that was about as likely to pan out as a snowball in Death Valley. He possessed a certain roguish charm, though, that made it impossible to truly dislike the man, even when you suspected he was trying to separate you from your last dollar. He was, in short, a delightful scoundrel, a reminder that out in the territories, sometimes the most valuable commodity wasn't gold or silver, but a good story and a healthy dose of skepticism. And heaven knows, Morgan provided both in spades.
