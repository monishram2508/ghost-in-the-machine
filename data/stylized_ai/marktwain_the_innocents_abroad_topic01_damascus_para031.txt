Damascus, you see, is an old, wheezy city, older, I daresay, than Methuselah’s spectacles, and just as dusty. One can practically chew the air; a gritty concoction of sand, ancient secrets, and the lingering aroma of donkey droppings. I reckon that if history had a belly button, Damascus would be it, a sort of navel of the world, though perhaps a bit linty. You stumble over more ruins here than you do stray cats, and that, my friends, is saying something. Every street corner whispers tales of sultans, saints, and scoundrels, all jumbled together like a deck of cards that's been shuffled by a drunken dervish. 

The people, bless their persevering souls, are a curious lot, perpetually haggling with the enthusiasm of a terrier after a rat. You can't even ask the time of day without finding yourself in a ten-minute negotiation about the merits of water clocks versus sundials. And the merchants! Good heavens, they could sell sand to a Bedouin, and then convince him he needed a second shipment for his summer home. They'll show you a rug they swear was woven by the angels themselves, then tell you it’s practically giving it away at a price that'd make Croesus blush. I bought one myself, supposedly from the loom of Fatima, though it sheds more wool than a nervous sheep in a shearing shed. But, bless my fool heart, I believe them anyway. There's a certain charm, you see, to being fleeced in Damascus. It’s practically a cultural experience, like attending the opera or getting a tooth pulled, only slightly less painful and a great deal more entertaining. Though I suspect my wife will have a few choice words when she sees the state of our carpet when I return home with it. More than likely a battle of words will commence that's worthy of being named in one of Homer's classics.
