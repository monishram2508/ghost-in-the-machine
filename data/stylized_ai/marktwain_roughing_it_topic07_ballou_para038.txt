Ballou, now there's a name that could curdle milk and start a dog fight all at once. Ballou. It sounds like a disgruntled sneeze caught in a rusty trombone. I met him, of course, out West – you can't swing a dead cat in Nevada without hitting three or four fellows calling themselves Ballou, or Higgins, or some other such moniker destined for obscurity. This particular Ballou was a lawyer, or at least, he *claimed* to be a lawyer. I suspect his law degree came from a correspondence course advertised on the back of a patent medicine pamphlet. He had that look about him, you know – the kind that says he's always just one step ahead of the bill collector, and two steps behind common sense.

He was representing some poor soul who'd accidentally shot a jackrabbit on the sheriff's property, which, in those parts, was considered high treason against the entire state. Ballou, bless his heart, was arguing that the jackrabbit was a "public nuisance," and therefore open season on it. The judge, a fella with a beard like a runaway tumbleweed and a gavel that looked suspiciously like a discarded axe handle, wasn't buying it. Every time Ballou opened his mouth, the judge looked like he was chewing on a mouthful of buckshot.

Ballou's defense strategy involved a lot of arm-waving, a rambling monologue about the economic impact of jackrabbits on the silver mining industry (which, as far as I could tell, was precisely zero), and a dramatic reading from a dog-eared copy of Blackstone's Commentaries. It was a performance, I'll give him that. A terribly misguided, utterly ineffective performance, but a performance nonetheless. The jury, a collection of sunburnt miners who looked like they hadn't seen soap or water since the last eclipse, were clearly more interested in spitting tobacco juice at the spittoon than listening to Ballou's legal mumbo-jumbo. In the end, the poor fellow got fined a hefty sum, and Ballou, pockets lighter and dignity even more so, shuffled out of the courthouse, muttering something about appealing to the Supreme Court. I reckon he's still appealing it, bless his cotton socks. Last I heard, he was practicing law in a saloon in Deadwood, specializing in divorce cases and barroom brawls. A fitting end, I'd say, for a lawyer named Ballou.
