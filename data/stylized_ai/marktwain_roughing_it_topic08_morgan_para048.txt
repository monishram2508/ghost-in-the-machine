Now, Morgan, there was a specimen, a genuine article, if ever I saw one, though I wouldn't bet a plugged nickel on his sanity. He arrived in Virginia City lookin' like he'd been wrung out and hung on the line to dry, all angles and elbows and a beard that could house a family of field mice. Claimed he was a prospector, come to strike it rich, but his pickaxe looked like it hadn't seen the glint of sunlight in years. He had eyes, mind you, that could bore a hole clear through a mountain, but they were usually focused on some invisible critter dancin' just behind your head.

He took up residence in a shack outside of town, a hovel so ramshackle it made the coyotes think twice about settlin' down nearby. Spent his days mumblin' to himself and his nights buildin' contraptions out of scrap metal and wagon wheels. Said he was building a machine to find gold, or maybe to talk to the spirits of the departed, or perhaps both – it was hard to tell with Morgan. One fella, a real wag by the name of 'Whiskey' Bill, swore he saw Morgan tryin' to hitch his mule to a weather vane, convincin' it that they were headed to the Comstock Lode via the jet stream.

Now, most folks just chuckled and shook their heads at Morgan. Figured he was harmless, just a bit touched in the head. But I reckon there was somethin' more to him than met the eye. He had a way of lookin' at the mountains, like he understood their secrets. And every now and then, he'd come into town with a nugget or two that'd make even the greediest claim jumper green with envy. Where he found 'em? Well, that remained Morgan's own peculiar mystery, tucked away somewhere in that tangle of a mind of his, alongside the schematics for his perpetual motion machine and his recipe for invisible ink. He was a strange bird, alright, Morgan, a reminder that out here in the West, there was room for all sorts, even the ones who seemed to have lost their map somewhere along the way.
