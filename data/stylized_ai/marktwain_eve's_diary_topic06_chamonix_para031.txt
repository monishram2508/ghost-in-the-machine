Chamonix, they call it. Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, to be precise, as if one could misplace the beastly mountain and find oneself accidentally lodged in Chamonix-under-the-Haystack instead. It's a place of preposterous heights and even more preposterous prices. One strolls through the main street, dodging fur-clad women who look as though they’ve just wrestled a Yeti and lost, and are now sporting its pelt in mournful tribute, and one is assaulted on all sides by shops selling equipment guaranteed to turn even the most cautious soul into a death-defying alpinist. Of course, said equipment costs more than a small principality, and the only peak most of these chaps are scaling is the credit card bill at the end of the month.

The air itself crackles with a sort of manic energy, the sort you find in places where people are constantly teetering on the edge of mortal peril, or at least pretending to. One hears tales of daring rescues, of daring ascents, of daring escapes from restaurants that charge exorbitant prices for lukewarm vin chaud. The locals, bless their cotton socks, regard these death-wish adventurers with a mixture of amusement and exasperation. After all, they’ve seen it all before. They’ve seen the Germans in lederhosen, the Americans with their gadgets, and the British with their unwavering conviction that they can conquer anything with a flask of lukewarm tea and a stiff upper lip. And the mountain, that stony old matriarch, just sits there, impassive and indifferent, watching them all scurry about like ants, daring them to prove their mettle, while simultaneously reminding them of their insignificance. One can't help but wonder if she's chuckling quietly to herself, the old hussy, at the sheer folly of it all.
