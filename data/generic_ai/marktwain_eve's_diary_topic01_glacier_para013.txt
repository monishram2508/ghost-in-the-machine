A glacier is a colossal, slow-moving river of ice formed over centuries or millennia by the accumulation and compaction of snow. Unlike frozen lakes or seas, glaciers are dynamic entities, constantly reshaping the landscapes they inhabit. Their formation begins in areas where snowfall exceeds melting, typically at high altitudes or latitudes. As layers of snow accumulate, the weight of the overlying snow compresses the lower layers, gradually transforming them into dense glacial ice. This process involves repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, eventually expelling air and creating a solid, crystalline structure. Glacial ice possesses a unique property called plasticity, allowing it to deform and flow under its own weight, albeit at a glacial pace. The movement is driven by a combination of internal deformation, where ice crystals slide past each other, and basal sliding, where the glacier slides over a thin layer of water or sediment at its base.

The morphology of a glacier is diverse, influenced by factors like ice thickness, topography, and climate. Crevasses, deep cracks in the ice surface, form where the glacier flows over uneven terrain or experiences tensile stress. Moraines, ridges of unsorted sediment, mark the edges and former extents of the glacier, providing valuable evidence of past glacial activity. Erosional features sculpted by glaciers are equally prominent, including U-shaped valleys, cirques (bowl-shaped depressions), and striated bedrock. These features testify to the immense power of glaciers to carve and reshape the landscape. Glaciers play a critical role in the Earth's hydrological cycle, storing vast quantities of freshwater and releasing it slowly through meltwater streams. These streams are crucial water sources for many communities, particularly in mountainous regions. However, glaciers are also highly sensitive indicators of climate change. Rising global temperatures are causing glaciers to melt at an accelerated rate, contributing to sea level rise and altering regional water availability. The retreat of glaciers is a visible and tangible consequence of human-induced climate change, highlighting the urgent need for action to mitigate its impacts. The study of glaciers, known as glaciology, is essential for understanding Earth's climate system and predicting future changes in water resources and sea levels.
