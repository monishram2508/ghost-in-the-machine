Now, about this Colosseum, this...amusement park for the ages, mind you. A fellow ambles into Rome, and what’s the first thing they want to see? Not the Pope, bless his soul, nor some fancy painting in a gallery where you have to whisper and pretend you understand what’s going on. No, sir. They want to see where the lions ate the Christians, or vice versa, depending on your leanings and who had the better agent. It’s a grand, crumbling spectacle, this thing, like a giant’s discarded toy, left out in the rain for a few centuries. They built it, these Romans, for entertainment. And you know what? They were rather good at it, though I suspect their definition of “entertainment” might differ slightly from ours. A good hanging, a chariot race with a few fatal mishaps, and of course, the pièce de résistance – a gladiator versus a particularly grumpy bear. Why, I can just imagine the program notes: “Tonight! Prepare yourselves for a thrilling evening of carnage and cheap thrills! Starring, as always, death itself!”

You wander through its ruins, dodging pigeons who seem to have inherited the Roman sense of entitlement, and you try to picture the roar of the crowd, the glint of steel, the, ahem, dramatic exits of the less fortunate. It’s all a bit much, really. So much pomp and circumstance just to watch someone get stabbed. And the blood! Good heavens, the blood! I daresay they had slaves whose sole occupation was mopping up the arena floor. Talk about a thankless job. I'll bet they weren’t given season tickets, either. But there it stands, this Colosseum, a testament to the enduring human fascination with violence and spectacle. Makes you wonder what future generations will make of our reality television shows, doesn't it? Perhaps they’ll build a giant amphitheater to watch reruns of cooking competitions, and speculate on whether the soufflé truly fell of its own accord, or if sabotage was afoot. Now *that* would be entertainment worthy of the Caesars, in my humble opinion.
