Higbie, now there was a specimen, a study in contrasts you wouldn't find plastered on a patent medicine bottle. He hailed from the backwoods of the Buckeye State, Ohio, or some such wilderness, and bore all the markings of a man who'd chewed more splinters than solid victuals in his day. He was a lanky contraption, all angles and elbows, like a scarecrow escaped from a cornfield, clad in garments that seemed to have survived the War of 1812 with more dignity than comfort. His face, bless your heart, was a roadmap of hard times and outdoor living, tanned to a leather that would put a saddlebag to shame, and creased with more lines than a topographical map of the Sierras. You’d think, judging by appearances, that he’d be as quiet as a church mouse, but Lord, when Higbie got to talking, you couldn’t shut him up with a cork.

And what tales he spun! Stories of prospecting richer than any Comstock Lode, claims that produced more gold than Fort Knox, mines that could make a man king. Of course, every tale got taller with each telling, seasoned with embellishments and outright whoppers that’d make Baron Munchausen blush. He had a knack for making the impossible sound almost believable, you see, a talent for weaving a yarn so thick you could hang your hat on it. Did I believe him? Well, not entirely. Did I enjoy listening to him? Absolutely. Because even if half his stories were pure fiction, the other half was filled with that frontier spirit, that unquenchable thirst for adventure and fortune that drove men out West in the first place. He was a living, breathing tall tale himself, Higbie was, a genuine article, a specimen of humanity as peculiar and valuable as any gold nugget you might find in the bowels of the earth, even if that nugget turned out to be mostly fool's gold. And in those days, a little fool's gold was better than no gold at all, especially when it came with a good story.
