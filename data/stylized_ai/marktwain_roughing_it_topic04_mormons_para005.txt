Them Mormons, now there’s a breed. I reckon if you dropped a hat in Salt Lake City, it’d land on a polygamist’s head, or at least someone who used to be. And the women? Well, bless their cotton socks, they seem to multiply faster than rabbits in a carrot patch. Brigham Young, now there was a man for you. Had more wives than I’ve had hot dinners, and that’s saying something. They say he was a prophet, a seer, and all sorts of fantastical things. Me, I reckon he was just a clever fellow who knew a good thing when he saw it, and apparently a “good thing” came in the shape of a whole passel of wives.

I rode through their city once, Salt Lake, and it was something to behold. Straight streets, clean as a whistle, and nary a saloon in sight. Now, that's just plain unnatural if you ask me. Any town without a good watering hole is suspect in my book. They were industrious, though, I'll grant them that. Buzzed about like bees in a hive, building temples and tilling the land. They even irrigated the desert, turned that wasteland into something green and fertile. Hard to argue with results like that, even if their theology does sound a bit like a dime novel.

Heard tell of their beliefs, about golden plates and angels appearing and what all. Seems mighty peculiar to a plain-spoken feller like myself. But who am I to judge? Every man’s got a right to his own brand of foolishness, long as he ain’t hurting nobody. Though I did hear tell of a few folks “blood atoning” back in the day, which sounded more like a butcher’s shop than a religion if you want my honest opinion. Still, times change, and even the Mormons seem to be mellowing out a bit. Fewer wives, more Sunday socials, and fewer stories about turning into pillars of salt. All in all, they’re a curious lot, them Mormons. You might not agree with their ways, but you can’t deny they got gumption. And in this world, a little gumption can go a long way.
