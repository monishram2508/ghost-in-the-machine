Harris, bless his heart, is a specimen of human nature the likes of which I reckon you wouldn't find duplicated this side of the Mississippi, or maybe even the other. He’s a fella possessed of an optimism so sturdy it could hold up a cathedral, even if that cathedral was made entirely of bad luck and shoddy construction. He'll tell you the darkest storm cloud has a silver lining, and then probably try to sell you the silver lining for twice what it's worth, claiming it's been blessed by a genuine Cherokee medicine man. Now, I ain’t saying Harris is dishonest, not exactly. He just… embellishes. He sees the world through a prism of his own making, where every molehill is a mountain begging to be conquered, and every swamp rat a potential pet with a penchant for fetching sticks.

He's got a head full of ideas, most of ‘em half-baked and prone to exploding at inopportune moments, scattering the remnants of his grand schemes like shrapnel. Remember that time he decided to breed glow-worms for a firefly-powered illumination business? Well, the glow-worms turned out to be notoriously shy and refused to glow on demand, and the whole venture ended with him ankle-deep in damp leaves and a whole lot of disappointed customers expecting to light up their garden parties with insect luminescence. Yet, did that dampen his spirits? Not a whit. He just dusted himself off, declared the market "not ready for advanced firefly technology," and moved on to his next grand design – a self-stirring butter churn powered by trained squirrels. I haven't seen that particular marvel come to fruition yet, but I wouldn't put it past him. He's got the persistence of a mosquito in a nudist colony, that Harris, and a heart so filled with misguided enthusiasm that it could power a steam engine, albeit a rather erratic and unreliable one. But you can't help but admire the sheer audacity of the man. He’s a walking testament to the power of believing your own tall tales, and, to be honest, he makes life a darn sight more interesting, even if it's mostly in a "hold onto your hat, here comes Harris!" kind of way.
