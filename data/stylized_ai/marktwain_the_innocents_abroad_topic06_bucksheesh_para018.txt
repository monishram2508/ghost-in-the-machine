Now, concerning this bucksheesh, this sticky-fingered cousin of the bribe, let us not feign innocence, as if we've never encountered its outstretched palm. Why, even the most upright missionary, fresh off the boat and clutching his Bible tighter than a miser clutches his gold, will soon learn that a judicious disbursement of a few piasters can smooth out the wrinkles in even the most righteous path. Bucksheesh, you see, is the oil that lubricates the machinery of everyday life in these parts, though some call it grease. It is the unspoken tax on progress, the gentle nudge that persuades the gatekeeper to see you before the line, the sweetener that encourages the camel driver to take the scenic, albeit slightly less direct, route.

One may argue, with a nose held high and a lecture on morality at the ready, that it is a corruption of the soul, a festering sore on the body politic. And perhaps it is. But then, so is mosquito fever, and one learns to slap the little devils away rather than curse the entire swamp. The truth is, bucksheesh is as ingrained in the local custom as haggling over carpets or drinking thick, sweet coffee. It is expected, anticipated even, a little ritual performed with winks and nods, a silent understanding that bypasses the need for bothersome paperwork or bureaucratic fuss.

I recall a particular incident in Cairo, involving a customs official with a face like a thundercloud and a stack of forms that seemed taller than the pyramids themselves. My baggage, naturally, was the subject of intense scrutiny. Pages rifled through, pockets meticulously examined, and furrowed brows a-plenty. It seemed I was destined for a three-day discourse on the proper importation of dental floss. But lo and behold, a crumpled banknote, slipped surreptitiously into the offending document, worked like magic. The thundercloud dissipated, a smile (somewhat alarming, it must be admitted) replaced the frown, and I was waved through with a cheerful "Welcome to Egypt, Effendi!" Now, was this corruption? Perhaps. Was it also expedient? Undeniably. And did it leave me pondering the peculiar intricacies of human nature? Most assuredly. So, let us not judge too harshly this bucksheesh, for it is but a humble cog in the grand, often bewildering, machine of life.
