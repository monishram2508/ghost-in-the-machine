Mormons, officially known as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, are a religious group often misunderstood despite their growing presence globally. Their faith, which originated in the United States in the 19th century with Joseph Smith, centers on a belief in Jesus Christ and emphasizes the importance of families, personal revelation, and service to others. Beyond the Bible, Mormons consider the Book of Mormon to be scripture, a historical and spiritual record of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. This additional scripture, along with the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, forms the basis of their unique theological perspective. A core tenet of their faith involves the concept of continuing revelation, believing that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets in modern times, just as he did in biblical times. This belief informs their emphasis on living prophets and apostles who guide the Church.

Mormon culture is characterized by a strong sense of community and a high standard of moral conduct. They adhere to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which encourages abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, and promotes the consumption of wholesome foods. Family is considered paramount, with temple sealings – a ritual considered to bind families together for eternity – a significant focus. Many young Mormons, particularly men, choose to serve voluntary two-year missions, often to foreign countries, dedicating their time to proselyting and humanitarian work. This missionary service contributes to the Church's global reach and provides young adults with valuable life experiences. Mormons are known for their dedication to education, often pursuing higher education and valuing lifelong learning. They are also active in charitable endeavors and community service, reflecting their commitment to living Christ-like lives and improving the lives of those around them.
