The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, boasts a unique theological framework built upon the Bible and the Book of Mormon, a text they consider to be scripture revealed to Joseph Smith in the early 19th century. This distinct scripture, along with other doctrinal sources like the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, shapes their understanding of the plan of salvation, which includes a pre-mortal existence, earthly life as a testing ground, and a post-mortal spirit world with varying degrees of glory. A core tenet of Mormon belief is the potential for eternal progression, where individuals can ultimately become like God through obedience to gospel principles and ordinances. Temples hold special significance, serving as dedicated houses of worship where sacred ordinances such as baptism for the dead, endowments, and eternal marriage ceremonies are performed. These ordinances, they believe, extend blessings beyond this life and connect families eternally. A strong emphasis on family life is central to Mormon culture, with dedicated Family Home Evening held weekly to strengthen bonds and teach gospel principles. Missionary service is another hallmark, with young men and women often volunteering for two-year missions to proselyte and serve communities worldwide. The church maintains a hierarchical structure, with lay leaders holding responsibility for various aspects of local congregations, known as wards or branches. Decisions are ultimately guided by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, whom they consider to be modern-day prophets and apostles receiving revelation from God. Furthermore, Mormons are known for their commitment to a specific health code, the Word of Wisdom, which encourages abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee, while promoting a healthy diet and lifestyle. Charitable work, both within the church and globally, constitutes a significant aspect of their faith, reflecting their dedication to service and helping those in need. This distinctive blend of theology, practice, and community involvement creates a unique religious identity for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
