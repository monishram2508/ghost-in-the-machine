Ballou, now there's a specimen I wouldn't trade for a whole claim of Comstock silver, though some might argue the metal would at least be worth something besides a good chuckle. He arrived in our dusty corner of Nevada like a stray hound dog – all ears, hopeful eyes, and a tail wagging with misplaced enthusiasm. Lawyer, he claimed to be, a man of the law plucked fresh from some backwater Missouri town where chickens probably laid down legal precedent alongside their eggs. First time I saw him, he was trying to argue with a mule. A mule! And not winning, mind you. The mule just stared back, a look on its face that said, "Son, I've seen more law broken and enforced out here than you've read in all your books."

He was a walking contradiction, Ballou was. He’d quote Shakespeare one minute, then stumble over a sagebrush the next. Dressed in a suit that looked like it'd seen better days – and by better, I mean days when it was still hanging in a tailor's window back east – he’d attempt to navigate the chaotic landscape with the grace of a newborn calf on ice. His attempts at mining were even more comical. He swore he could smell silver in the air, a gift from the gods, he called it. Turned out he was just smelling the neighbor's chili simmering over the fire. One time, he tried to blast a rock with dynamite, forgetting, naturally, to get clear beforehand. Only saved himself by diving into a conveniently placed (though rather muddy) watering trough. Emerged looking like a drowned rat, sputtering and yelling about his legal rights, which, I reckon, mostly amounted to the right to look a fool. But, you know, there was something endearing about the fella. He had a heart as big as the Sierras and a naive belief that civilization could take root even in this godforsaken desert. He might not have struck gold, but he sure as shootin' struck up a good story, even if he was usually the punchline.
