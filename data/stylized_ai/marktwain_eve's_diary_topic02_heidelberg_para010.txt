Heidelberg, bless its picturesque little heart, sits nestled in its valley like a drowsy cat in a sunbeam, purring with the gentle murmur of the Neckar. One can’t help but be charmed, even though the place is crawling with American students, all desperately trying to look profound whilst scribbling notes in notebooks thicker than the average Bible. They wander about the castle ruins, no doubt imagining themselves as medieval knights, which is an amusing sight indeed, seeing as most of them couldn't wield a butter knife with any real danger. Speaking of the castle, it's a magnificent ruin, of course, a testament to war and time’s relentless nibbling. It’s like a grand old dame who's had a bit too much wine and lost a few teeth, but still manages to hold her head high. The famous Great Vat, a monstrous wine barrel, is another sight to behold. They say it held 49,000 gallons, enough to drown the entire population of the town twice over, though I suspect some of the students would consider that a challenge rather than a deterrent. The town itself is a charming jumble of cobblestone streets and half-timbered houses, all leaning on each other for support, as though afraid to fall down from sheer age. The restaurants serve up the sort of hearty German fare that threatens to add inches to one’s waistline with every bite, but one accepts this sacrifice willingly, for truly, what is life without a proper schnitzel and a good stein of beer? And don’t even get me started on the student duels! Apparently, they still engage in these ridiculous affairs, though now it’s all about getting a fashionable scar rather than actually settling any serious disputes. It's a testament, I suppose, to the human capacity for clinging to tradition, no matter how ludicrous it may seem. All in all, Heidelberg is a pleasant place to while away a few days, so long as one doesn't mind dodging earnest scholars and contemplating the vast quantities of wine one could potentially imbibe.
