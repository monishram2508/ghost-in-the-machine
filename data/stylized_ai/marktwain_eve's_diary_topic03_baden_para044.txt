Baden, ah, Baden! A place where the air is so thick with leisure it could choke a regiment of Prussian soldiers. It's a town built on the notion that one should do absolutely nothing strenuous unless it involves lifting a glass of champagne or wagering a small fortune on a turn of a card. I confess, I’ve rarely seen such earnest dedication to idleness outside of a Congressional session back home. The cure they offer is this: one wallows in thermal waters hotter than a jealous cook’s temper, drinks mineral concoctions that taste suspiciously like rust and sorrow, and listens to orchestras play melodies so saccharine they could rot your teeth faster than a candied plum.

And then, of course, there are the people. A collection of Emperors and Duchesses (at least, they claim to be, and who am I to contradict someone dripping in diamonds and smelling of borrowed money?) gathered like moths to a particularly gaudy flame. They promenade along the Lichtentaler Allee, a glorified sidewalk festooned with flowers that seem to sneer at my plebian attire. The ladies, bless their hearts, are adorned in gowns that could shelter a family of field mice, their hats defying both gravity and good taste. The gentlemen, equally burdened by fashion, strut with canes that seem designed less for support and more for theatrical gesticulation. They whisper secrets behind perfumed handkerchiefs, secrets that are invariably about who is sleeping with whom, or who lost the most money last night at the casino. 

It's a grand spectacle, truly. One feels compelled to observe it all with a detached amusement, like watching a particularly elaborate puppet show performed by people who take themselves far too seriously. I, myself, have tried to join in, of course. I've attempted to look bored with the ease of a seasoned gambler, to sip the mineral water with the casual grace of a crowned head, but alas, my American honesty keeps bubbling to the surface like a particularly unwelcome burp at a royal banquet. Still, one must admit, there's a certain charm to this orchestrated absurdity, a certain captivating quality to this carefully cultivated atmosphere of decadence. It's a place where one can forget, for a fleeting moment, that the world is populated with anything other than idle aristocracy and the poor souls who cater to their every whim. A temporary paradise, perhaps, but like all paradises, one suspects it’s built on a foundation of rather shaky morals and even shakier finances.
