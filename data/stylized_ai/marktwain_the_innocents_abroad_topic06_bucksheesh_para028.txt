Now, you see, the fella just strollin' along, mindin' his own business, that's a rare sight in these here parts. More often than not, he's either got a camel to flog, a carpet to unroll, or a hand outstretched, palm up like a thirsty flower beggin' for a drink. They call it "bucksheesh," this peculiar custom, and it's about as woven into the fabric of this land as sand is to a desert wind. Don't let nobody tell you it's outright beggin', mind you. No sir, it's more of a... lubricatin' oil, greasin' the wheels of everyday life. A little somethin' to keep the engine hummin', as it were. You want that gate opened? Bucksheesh. You need directions to the oasis, which, incidentally, seems to move further away the closer you get? Bucksheesh. You fancy a smile from the local constable, a fellow usually lookin' as sour as a week-old lemon? Well, you guessed it, bucksheesh!

It ain't always about money, neither. Sometimes it's a cigarette, a piece of fruit, or even a kind word – though them last two are rarer than a honest politician. I recall once, tryin' to get my donkey, Bess, through a particularly narrow passage. The fella in charge, a wiry old coot with a face like a dried fig, he stood his ground, arms crossed, lookin' as stubborn as Bess herself. After some friendly but ultimately futile persuasion, I offered him a biscuit. He eyed that biscuit like it was the Koh-i-Noor diamond, sniffed it suspiciously, then popped it in his mouth, swallowed, and waved us on through. Bess, bless her cotton socks, brayed in what I could only interpret as disgusted laughter. It just goes to show, sometimes the smallest bribe can move mountains, or at least, a particularly recalcitrant donkey and her exasperated owner. Bucksheesh, it appears, is the universal language, spoken fluently from the grandest Pasha down to the humblest street sweeper, and understood perfectly by every soul in between. A clever system, in its own peculiar way, although it does leave a fella perpetually scratchin' his head and wonderin' if he's carryin' enough biscuits.
