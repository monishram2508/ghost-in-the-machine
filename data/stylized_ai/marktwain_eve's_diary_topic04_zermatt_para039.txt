Zermatt, you say? Why, it’s a place where the very air seems to have aspirations above its station, rarefied though it may be. Up you climb, on one of those infernal rack railways that shudder and groan like a dyspeptic dragon, until you find yourself amidst a collection of chalets that appear to have been scattered by a particularly whimsical giant, each vying for the best view of the Matterhorn. And what a view it is! Majestic, indifferent, and utterly untroubled by the swarms of tourists clamoring for its portrait. I suspect the mountain regards us all with a paternalistic amusement, much like a learned professor observing a class of particularly dense students.

The natives, bless their industrious hearts, are perpetually polishing the already spotless streets, lest a single speck of dust dare to insult the pristine mountain air. They’ve banned automobiles, a decision so enlightened it makes one wonder why the rest of the world hasn’t followed suit. Instead, one is conveyed hither and yon by electric carts that hum along with the earnest zeal of miniature zealots. The tourists, of course, are a sight to behold. They arrive bedecked in outfits that scream “I conquered K-Mart!” rather than “I conquered the Alps!”, their faces flushed with a mixture of exertion and excitement. One sees them attempting to master the noble art of skiing, often with the grace of a newborn giraffe, or posing precariously on slopes, convinced they are capturing a moment of breathtaking beauty for posterity, when in reality they are merely documenting the precise shade of their windburned nose. And the restaurants! Oh, the restaurants, where one can pay exorbitant sums for cheese fondue that tastes remarkably similar to what one might whip up at home, were one inclined to spend an afternoon scraping burnt cheese off the bottom of a pot. But no matter, the view is magnificent, the air is bracing, and the sheer absurdity of it all is utterly charming. Zermatt, you see, is not just a place; it's a performance, and we are all both actors and audience members in this high-altitude farce.
