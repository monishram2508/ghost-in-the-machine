Baden, ah, Baden! A place so steeped in leisure it practically oozes from the very cobblestones. One might think, stepping off the train and into its perfumed air, that the entire population had swallowed a sleeping draught and was forever trapped in a pleasant, mildly expensive dream. I half expected to see cherubic little boys, armed with tiny rakes, tidying up any misplaced sunbeams, so orderly and picture-perfect was the place. The springs, they say, possess remarkable curative powers. I observed a lady, quite rotund and shimmering with diamonds, partaking of the waters with the solemnity one reserves for Holy Communion. I’m certain she believed she was dissolving away at least a pound of flab per sip, though I suspect a less strenuous diet of cream cakes might have proved equally efficacious, and certainly more palatable. The Kursaal, that grand edifice of gambling and idle chatter, glittered with a thousand chandeliers, each vying to outshine the baubles adorning the ladies present. I watched men, faces flushed with a mixture of hope and impending ruin, cling desperately to lady Luck’s fickle skirts. One fellow, I swear, was consulting a deck of cards hidden within his voluminous mustache before each bet. It struck me as a trifle unsportsmanlike, but who am I to judge the methods of desperate men? The air hummed with the whispers of secrets, the clinking of champagne glasses, and the rustling of silk gowns, a symphony of indolence conducted by the ghost of a forgotten Austrian composer. Even the pigeons, those feathered ragamuffins found in every corner of the globe, seemed to carry themselves with a newfound air of aristocratic boredom, as if they’d inherited titles and vast estates from a long-lost relative who’d choked on a particularly large croissant. One could spend a lifetime in Baden, drifting from spa to salon to supper, without ever encountering a single pressing concern, unless, of course, one considered the agonizing decision of choosing between the Black Forest gateau and the Sachertorte to be a matter of national importance.
