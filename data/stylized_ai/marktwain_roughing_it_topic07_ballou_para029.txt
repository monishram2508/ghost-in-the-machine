Ballou, now there was a specimen worthy of Barnum himself. A lawyer, of sorts, though I suspect his legal library consisted of a dog-eared copy of “How to Win Friends and Influence People” and a particularly stained collection of newspaper clippings detailing his own past misadventures. He attached himself to our little expedition to the silver mines like a burr to a donkey’s tail – persistent, irritating, and ultimately, unavoidable. Claimed to be a dab hand at everything from assaying ore to calming stampeding cattle, though his actual skillset seemed to revolve mostly around consuming prodigious amounts of tinned peaches and avoiding honest work. I wouldn’t trust him to sharpen a pencil, let alone defend a man in court, but bless his heart, he certainly tried.

He fancied himself a master of disguise, Ballou did. Once, attempting to blend in with a group of Piute Indians, he donned a feather headdress fashioned from a molting rooster and proceeded to address them in a mangled, guttural language he’d concocted himself. The Piutes, bless their stoic souls, just stared at him with that same expression a man reserves for a particularly stubborn mule. Another time, convinced we were being followed by bandits, he rigged up a complex system of ropes and pulleys intended to hurl a bucket of flour upon our pursuers. Of course, the flour landed squarely on yours truly, turning me into a ghostly apparition fit to scare the daylights out of even the most hardened desperado. Ballou, covered head-to-toe in the white powder, merely grinned, proclaiming the operation a resounding success. He was a walking disaster, a human-sized pratfall perpetually waiting to happen, but darned if he wasn't unintentionally entertaining. You couldn't help but find a certain affection for the man, like a stray dog that keeps chewing on your boots – annoying, yes, but utterly incapable of malice, and possessing a peculiar charm all its own.
