Brigham, that prophet of the desert, now there's a character for the ages. Picture this: a man with the gravitas of a thundercloud and the stubbornness of a Missouri mule, leading a whole flock of pious souls across the plains, all the while convinced he was hot-footing it to the promised land. Said promised land turned out to be, well, Salt Lake City. Now, I ain’t knocking Salt Lake, mind you, but even a blind man could see it weren’t exactly flowing with milk and honey when they first arrived. More like sagebrush and alkali dust, with a dash of mosquito buzzing for good measure. Brigham, though, bless his heart, declared it a paradise, a veritable Eden, and proceeded to build his empire. 

He weren’t no saint, this Brigham, not by a long shot. He had more wives than a sultan had belly dancers, and managed them all, from what I hear, with the iron hand of a railroad foreman. Some whispered about scandalous goings-on behind closed doors, but I say, let he who is without sin cast the first stone – especially when it comes to managing that many women. It's a task that would make even Solomon weep into his beard. But for all his… peculiarities, Brigham was a born leader. He had that charisma, that unshakeable belief in himself that could make a man follow him straight into the jaws of perdition, and likely be thanking him for the experience while they were being chewed. He built a city out of practically nothing, organized a whole society, and defied the federal government with a chutzpah that’d make a gambler blush. He was a rough diamond, no doubt, a bit crude around the edges, but undeniably brilliant. You might not have agreed with his theology or his lifestyle, but you couldn’t deny the sheer force of his personality. Brigham Young, folks, he was one for the history books, even if half the stories they tell about him are taller than the Wasatch Mountains.
