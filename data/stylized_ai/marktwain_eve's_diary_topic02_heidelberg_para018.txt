Heidelberg! Ah, Heidelberg. A town draped in ivy like a lovesick swain clings to his mistress. One can’t help but be charmed, unless, of course, one is a Prussian, in which case charm is a malady to be cured with copious amounts of beer and the rattling of sabers. The castle, now, there’s a spectacle! More ruin than castle, truth be told, though what remains is magnificent in its decay. It’s as if Time, having conquered the place, decided to redecorate with creeping vines and strategically placed cracks. One can imagine the knights of old, their armor gleaming, their intentions perhaps less so, swaggering through its halls. Now, only tourists swagger, snapping photographs with those infernal contraptions that capture a soul quicker than a gypsy’s curse. 

The town itself, nestled beside the Neckar, is a charming warren of cobblestone streets, so uneven that a teetotaler could stagger about like a drunkard. Shops selling cuckoo clocks abound, each one more insistent on announcing the hour than the last, a mechanical cacophony that would drive a saint to strong drink. And the students! Heidelberg is overrun with them, youthful faces brimming with philosophy and the conviction that they alone hold the key to unlocking the universe. They sing, they debate, they engage in ritual scarification – all in the name of higher learning, naturally. I’ve no doubt they’ll amount to something grand, or perhaps they’ll just end up selling cuckoo clocks. One never can tell with these youngsters, can one? They seem to spend half their lives pondering the meaning of life and the other half forgetting where they left their beer steins. Still, they add a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain delightful chaos, to the already intoxicating atmosphere. Heidelberg, I suspect, is the sort of place one comes to with every intention of spending a week and ends up staying a lifetime, slowly becoming as gloriously dilapidated as the castle itself.
