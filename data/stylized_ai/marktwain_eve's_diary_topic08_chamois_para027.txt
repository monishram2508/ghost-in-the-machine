Well, I never did hold much truck with these chamois folk, nimble as they may be. They prance about on those Alps, you see, acting like they own the whole blessed mountain. Preposterous, I say! Why, I’ve seen cats with more common sense than to go gallivanting on such precarious perches. Imagine, a creature content to nibble on sparse vegetation up there amidst the snowdrifts. It’s enough to give a sensible person the vapors. And the vanity of the things! Dressed in that little brown coat like they’re attending a fancy ball. As if anyone but another chamois gives a fig about their fashion sense.

They say they are difficult to hunt, being swift and wary. Now, I’ll grant you, that’s likely true. But I wager a man with a good hound and a sturdy pair of boots could still outwit one. The trouble is, who'd want to? They are all skin and bones, those creatures; one might as well try to make a hearty stew out of a handful of twigs. Besides, I've heard tell that their skin makes a fine cleaning cloth. Now, that is something worth considering, but then the bother of climbing up to that neck of the woods. I might just settle for a nice linen towel, I think. Much less trouble, and probably just as effective at wiping away the dust that seems to be the sole purpose of my existence.

And, oh, that leaping! My goodness, they jump over those rocks like they’re playing hopscotch. One would think that they’re afraid of touching the ground. Though, I cannot say I blame them, some of those grounds up there are quite dangerous. To each their own, I suppose. Just give me solid ground, a comfortable chair, and a glass of something cool. I will leave the mountain jumping to the chamois folk. Let them have their Alps and their antics, while I sit here and contemplate the absurdity of it all. Indeed, the good Lord made some curious creatures, and the chamois, bless their heart, are certainly among the more peculiar.
