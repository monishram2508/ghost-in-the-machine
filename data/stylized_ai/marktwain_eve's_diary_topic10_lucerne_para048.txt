Lucerne, they call it, and a right pretty little town it is, though built, as most of these European nests are, with a confoundedly inconvenient disregard for any sensible American's notion of straight lines and right angles. The lake, now that’s a spectacle fit for a king, or at least for someone who hasn't seen the Mississippi on a good, muddy day. All that blue, stretching out as far as the eye can see, with mountains poking up all around, like giants trying to sneak a peek at what you're having for dinner. One gets a bit tired of mountains after a while, though. They do loom.

The people are pleasant enough, if you don't mind the singsong way they speak, which sounds for all the world like a choir practicing scales. And they’re everlastingly offering you cheese, or chocolate, or both. Which is all very well, mind you, but a man can only consume so much dairy and sugar before he begins to suspect he’ll sprout horns and grow a beard like a Swiss mountain goat. I witnessed a spectacle on the lake. A great throng of people were in these small wooden boats. The boats looked as if they were made out of matchsticks. But the people seemed to enjoy it. They sat there and went forward and backward. Seemed to be something they liked to do.

The Lion of Lucerne, that now, that's a thing worth a gander. Carved right out of the rock, a colossal beast, looking for all the world as if he’s got a splitting headache. Commemorates the Swiss Guards, they say, who died defending some French king or another. Seems to me a mighty sorrowful way to spend your life, dying for a foreigner, but then, I'm a practical man and not given to dying for causes unless those causes involve a particularly fine cut of beefsteak. But then, they are very proud. They believe that there is some great glory in fighting valiantly. These men have such a different mindset. But I'd rather be eating a hearty meal while watching others being foolish. In closing, Lucerne is a fine place to be.
