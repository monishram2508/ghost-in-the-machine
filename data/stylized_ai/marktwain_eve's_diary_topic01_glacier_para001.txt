Now, concerning these glaciers, bless you, Eve hadn't a glimmer what they were before Adam, ever the show-off, drags me up this mountain, high enough that the air itself feels like it's trying to pick a fight. And there it was, this monstrous river of ice, looking for all the world like some giant had spilled a bowl of cream and then forgotten to clean it up for, oh, a thousand years or so. Adam, of course, launches into a lecture, something about 'accumulation zones' and 'glacial flow,' terms as dull as ditchwater and about as useful as a fig leaf in a blizzard. He explained that it was water, frozen solid, and that it moved. Moves! I thought. Slower than a snail on a Sunday stroll, I reckon.

He went on and on, the dear man, about how it carved out valleys and left behind rocks the size of our entire garden – honestly, you'd think he'd invented the thing himself. I tried to look interested, even asked a question about whether the ice tasted different from the ice back home (it didn't, disappointing) but mostly I was just marveling at the sheer scale of it. Imagine, a solid river, inching its way down the mountainside. It’s a sight that humbles a body, no mistake. Makes you consider that maybe, just maybe, we aren't the only show in town. Adam pointed out all the 'evidence' of its movement, grooves in the stone and debris left over from its ponderous journey. It all looked like a mess to me, but Adam insisted it was a history book written in ice. Men and their books. Always thinking everything needs writin' down when a body can just look and see. I found a small, perfectly round stone and stuck it in my pocket. That history was enough for me.
