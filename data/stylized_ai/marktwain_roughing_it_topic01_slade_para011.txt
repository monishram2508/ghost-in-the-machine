Slade, that little excrescence clinging to the Sierra like a burr on a woolly dog, was a sight to behold, or rather, a sight to be endured. A collection of clapboard shacks leaning every which way, propped up with more optimism than lumber, it boasted a population hovering somewhere between twenty and however many prospectors were currently too drunk to count. The air itself tasted of dust and pine needles, seasoned with a generous helping of mule, a bouquet that would curdle the milk of a saint. They called it a town, mind you, but I reckon a particularly ambitious prairie dog colony had more civic planning.

The main street, if you could flatter it with such a name, was a ribbon of mud that served double duty as the town's sewer and playground, depending on the season and the proclivities of the local hogs. One emporium, a monument to mercantile ambition or perhaps just stubborn foolishness, held everything from pickaxes to patent medicine, all coated in a fine layer of grit and selling for three times the price you'd pay back East. The proprietor, a feller named Silas, had a beard that looked like a bird's nest after a hurricane and a glint in his eye that suggested he'd sell his own grandmother for a handful of nuggets.

Evenings in Slade were a symphony of misery and questionable entertainment. Saloons, of course, flourished like weeds in a neglected garden, their interiors dimly lit by sputtering lamps and echoing with the off-key melodies of a lone piano player who seemed to be permanently stuck in the key of C-minor. Card games, fueled by rotgut whiskey and desperation, invariably ended in shouting matches, the occasional fistfight, and the quiet lamentations of men who had just lost their last dollar to a cheatin’ card sharp. And then there was the hopeful gold rushers, always eager for their new claim, thinking that they are on the verge of striking it rich! No one in Slade ever struck it rich, least not I ever heard of, they were always chasing a dream as elusive as a jackrabbit in a whirlwind. In short, Slade was a place you visited if you had nowhere else to go, and left as soon as you could scrape together enough dust to buy a ticket out – unless, of course, you'd already lost your soul to the place, in which case, you were stuck there with the rest of us poor devils.
