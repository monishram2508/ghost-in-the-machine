Gibraltar, you see, is a place quite unlike any other, a prodigious hunk of rock sticking out its chin at Spain like a mischievous schoolboy daring a bigger lad to a scrap. It is, I reckon, a geological absurdity, a defiant promontory that nature, in a fit of whimsical extravagance, forgot to pack away properly. The first sight of it, rising from the sea like a slumbering lion, gives one the distinct impression that the Mediterranean has regurgitated a particularly indigestible morsel. And perched atop this leviathan is, of course, a garrison town, a charmingly cramped collection of shops, pubs, and red telephone boxes that look as if they’ve been plucked straight from a London fog. The inhabitants, bless their souls, are a curious breed, a veritable stew of British pluck, Mediterranean flair, and a healthy dose of Gibraltarian stubbornness – a concoction that, I daresay, could rival the best bouillabaisse. They speak a language all their own, a patois that sounds like a cockney trying to order paella after a particularly robust night at the pub.

The monkeys, ah, the monkeys! Now there’s a subject for an entire volume, or perhaps a cautionary tale. These Barbary apes, they hold the Rock in a sort of simian sway, ruling the roost with the brazen confidence of seasoned politicians. They are, in short, rascals of the highest order, pilfering tourists’ sandwiches with the deftness of a pickpocket and posing for photographs with the weary resignation of a seasoned celebrity. It is said that as long as the monkeys remain, Gibraltar will remain British. A clever superstition, I must admit, and one that ensures these furry brigands are treated with a certain degree of respect, lest the Empire crumble because one particularly greedy ape decides to abscond with a particularly fine bowler hat. One can imagine the headlines: "Monkeys Mutiny! Gibraltar Gone to the Apes!" A ludicrous notion, of course, but then again, Gibraltar itself is a bit of a ludicrous notion, and all the more delightful for it. It is, in its own peculiar way, a testament to the enduring power of British eccentricity, a rock solid reminder that sometimes, the most stubborn things are also the most enduring.
