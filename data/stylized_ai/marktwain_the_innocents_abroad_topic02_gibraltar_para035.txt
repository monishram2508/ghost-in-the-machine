Gibraltar, ah, Gibraltar! A most peculiar rock it is, jutting out of the Iberian Peninsula like a stubborn molar refusing to be extracted. To call it merely a "rock" feels a tad inadequate, mind you. It is a rock bristling with cannons, tunnels aplenty, and enough history crammed into its meager two square miles to fill a dozen stout volumes. One half expects to stumble upon a lost Roman legionary around any given corner, still griping about the weather. They claim it is British, bless their starched collars and bulldog tenacity. A claim the Spanish, just across the bay, view with a perpetual squint, not unlike a cat eyeing a canary just beyond reach. This results, naturally, in a simmering undercurrent of diplomatic… shall we say, "misunderstandings," that could curdle milk at fifty paces. The town itself, clinging precariously to the western slope, is a riot of duty-free shops peddling everything from gaudy trinkets to suspiciously cheap liquor, guaranteed to induce a delightful amnesia regarding one’s finances. The streets, narrow and winding, are perpetually thronged with tourists, sailors, and the occasional Barbary macaque, the latter being the island’s true rulers, if one pays close attention. These primates, cheeky little blighters, are masters of the art of petty larceny, relieving unsuspecting visitors of sunglasses, hats, and anything else not nailed down. Indeed, losing one's hat to a Gibraltarian ape is practically a rite of passage, a small price to pay for having witnessed this curious, miniature kingdom teetering on the edge of two continents, and quite possibly, on the very edge of sanity itself. One leaves Gibraltar with a sense of having witnessed something wholly unique, a glorious absurdity, a testament to human stubbornness, and the indomitable spirit of a nation clinging, quite literally, to a rock.
