Well, I reckon I've seen Mormons enough to fill a covered wagon, clear out here in the wild West. Queer folk, they are, in their way, and as industrious as a colony of ants at a picnic. I can’t rightly say I’ve ever fathomed their theology, what with golden plates and angels and such. Seems to me a right considerable yarn, spun finer than the silk on a gambler’s vest. I've seen their Salt Lake City, though – a veritable oasis in the desert, built with a grit that would make a rattlesnake blush. They irrigatin' like their lives depended on it, which, if you're out in that barren landscape, they surely do. It's a sight, I tell you, gardens blooming where only dust devils used to dance.

Now, about them wives. A body hears all sorts of tales, whispered behind hands and embellished faster than a prospector’s gold strike. Some claim it’s pure debauchery, a harem fit for a sultan. Others, the ones who've actually met these folks, usually say it's just mighty peculiar, but orderly in its own way. A man works hard, supports all them families, and they all seem content enough, churning butter and weaving cloth. It ain't my cup of tea, I reckon, but who am I to judge? I can barely keep one wife happy, let alone a whole passel of 'em. What strikes a man as odd is how much they stick together. They might have their squabbles, I imagine, like any family, but against outsiders, they present a united front tougher than mule-hide. And they're charitable, too. Help a fellow out when he's down on his luck, regardless of his beliefs. They’re a paradoxical bunch, these Mormons. You might scratch your head and wonder at their ways, but you can't deny they’ve turned a patch of dust into a regular Eden. And you can't argue with success, can you? Unless, of course, you're lookin' for a good argument; then, by all means, have at it. You'll likely find one.
