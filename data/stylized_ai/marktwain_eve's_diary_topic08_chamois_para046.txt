Now, about this creature called the chamois. Land sakes, what a fool thing to name an animal! Makes you think of a fancy French parlor, not a beast scrambling up a mountainside fit to make your heart stop just watchin'. I tell you, the Lord has a peculiar sense of humor, bless His heart. Anyway, the chamois – bless it’s ungainly self – is a critter that lives way up high in the Alps, like a goat that's had aspirations of bein' a bird but lacked the good sense to grow wings. They’re forever perched on ledges so thin a dime couldn't lay flat, their little black eyes glinting down at the world like they own the whole darn place.

They're a rum lot, these chamois, always skittish as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. One minute they're grazing peaceful-like, nibbling on some tough old mountain grass that would break your teeth faster than a politician's promise, and the next, *poof!*, they’re gone, vanished into thin air like a puff of smoke. You’d swear they teleported, but no, they just hopped and skipped and scampered up rocks that looked too steep for a housefly to climb. I reckon if a person could learn to move like a chamois, they could win every darn race they ever entered.

And the coats on them! A fellow could get a fine vest made from a chamois skin, if you could ever manage to catch one. Some folks say it makes for the softest polishing cloth imaginable. But I reckon skinning one of these magnificent creatures just to polish silverware is akin to using a Stradivarius as a fire poker. Just seems a mite wasteful. All that agility and grace, all that hard work of climbing mountainsides just to be a fancy duster! The world is full of such ironies, though, isn't it? Enough to make a body chuckle, and then maybe weep a little bit too.
