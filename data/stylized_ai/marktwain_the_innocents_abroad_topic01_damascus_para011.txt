Damascus, they call it the "Pearl of the Orient," a title seemingly conjured up by some fevered poet who'd perhaps imbibed too much arrack. Now, I've seen pearls, mind you, fine specimens plucked from oysters who didn't have the good sense to keep their mouths shut. But Damascus? Well, she's more like a tarnished silver locket, intricately carved and brimming with untold stories, some delightful, others best left buried beneath the dusty sands of time. The streets, bless their meandering souls, are a veritable labyrinth designed, I suspect, by a committee of particularly mischievous genies. You start off wanting a simple cup of coffee, and end up three hours later having bartered a perfectly good mule for a rug you neither need nor particularly want, all while being serenaded by a blind oud player who's clearly improvising with both the tune and the truth.

The inhabitants, ah, there's a breed for you. They'll smile with the warmth of a summer sun while simultaneously plotting to relieve you of your spare change, and possibly your camel. Don't misunderstand, they are gracious, hospitable even, but a fellow must keep his wits about him, like a chicken in a fox convention. Their hospitality is lavish, heaped with olives and sweetmeats and endless cups of that potent Arabic coffee that tastes like liquid ambition, and they'll regale you with tales of sultans and conquerors and the sheer magnificence of Damascus, tales that have likely been embellished a bit over the centuries, like a woman adding extra padding to her…ahem…form. And the noise! Good heavens, the din is enough to drive a sane man to drink, and a drunkard to repentance. The hawkers scream, the donkeys bray, the muezzin calls, all battling for dominance in the air like dueling banjos played by particularly tone-deaf angels. Still, despite the chaos and the potential for mild larceny, there's a certain undeniable charm to the place. It’s a messy, beautiful, exasperating, and altogether unforgettable city, a place where you're liable to lose your bearings, your patience, and maybe a few possessions, but where you'll also gain a story or two worth telling, even if you have to embellish them a tad yourself.
