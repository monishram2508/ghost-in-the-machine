Now, these miners, bless their hopeful, dust-choked hearts, were a species unto themselves. A feller could tell a miner from a preacher a mile off, even without the telltale canary dangling from his belt. For one, a preacher usually possessed a clean shirt, or at least one with more buttonholes than missing ones. A miner, well, his attire resembled less clothing and more a geological survey of the Nevada Territory, each stain representing a different stratum of dirt and desperation. They moved with a peculiar gait, too, sort of a hunch-shouldered shuffle born of years spent squinting at the faint flicker of a candle deep inside the belly of the earth, convinced they'd strike it rich just one more swing of the pickaxe. And Lord, could they swear! A parrot, after a week in a mining camp, would require serious spiritual intervention just to be fit company for a mule. Not that the mules seemed to mind much, they’d probably heard worse during branding season.

Their faith in fortune was truly something to behold. They'd bet their last dollar on a crooked card game, buy a lottery ticket with money they owed the saloon keeper, and then promptly dig another hole in the ground, convinced this time it was the Mother Lode herself waiting just beyond the next rock. They’d argue endlessly over the best way to find gold, each man an expert in geology, hydrology, and downright hogwash. One feller swore you could smell gold if the wind was right, while another claimed a dowsing rod made of willow was more reliable than a preacher’s promises. And yet, despite their hardscrabble existence and the slim chance of striking it rich, they clung to that dream with a tenacity that would make a bulldog blush. They were a rough bunch, these miners, but honest in their own way, and generally willing to share a swig of whiskey or a tall tale with anyone willing to listen. Just don’t get between them and their claim; that was a quicker route to the Pearly Gates than catching consumption in a damp tunnel.
