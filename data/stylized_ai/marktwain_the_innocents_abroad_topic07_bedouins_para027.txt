Now, the Bedouins, bless their sun-baked hides, are a breed apart. Imagine a fellow, tanned like old leather and just as supple, draped in more cloth than a draper’s shop, wandering the desert like he owns the place. Which, of course, according to him, he does. The desert, mind you, is not your fancy parlour room; it's a mighty inhospitable spread of sand and rock, hotter than a preacher's sermon on the wages of sin. Yet, these chaps navigate it like a duck takes to water, always knowing precisely where the next oasis, or at least a slightly less scorching patch of shade, might be lurking.

They’re a suspicious lot, naturally, having learned that trusting a stranger in the desert is about as sensible as betting on a camel race with a three-legged nag. Hospitality, though, is their byword, a peculiar contradiction I’ve often pondered. Offer them a drink and they'll treat you like a long-lost brother, sharing their meager dates and bitter coffee. But try to haggle for a camel and suddenly you're facing a barrage of insults delivered with the theatrical flair of a Shakespearean actor. Their camels, by the way, are another marvel. Ill-tempered, stubbornly independent creatures, yet fiercely loyal to their masters. A camel can spot a sandstorm brewing a week in advance, or so they claim, and I wouldn’t put it past them. They’re smarter than some politicians I’ve encountered, and certainly better travelled.

And their stories! Lord, could they spin a yarn. Legends of ancient kings, genies in lamps, and sand dunes that swallow entire armies whole. Whether it’s all true is a matter for debate, but the telling of it, with gestures wild as a desert wind, is worth the price of a camel ride alone. They are, in short, a people perfectly adapted to a world that would kill most civilized men in a heartbeat. A little rough around the edges, perhaps, a tad too fond of tribal grudges, but with a spirit as unyielding as the desert itself. A fella can’t help but admire them, even if he does spend half the time trying to figure out if they're trying to sell him something.
