Well, I reckon Higbie was one o’ them fellows you’d find squatting claim on a particularly lumpy patch o’ nowhere, swearing it was the next Comstock Lode if you just squinted right and used enough imagination. He’d been drifting ‘round these diggins’ since the Fraser River excitement fizzled out, a human tumbleweed blown by the winds o’ misplaced optimism. Always had some contraption he was tinkering with – usually involving a pickaxe tied to a mule’s tail and some fool notion of automated mining. Never quite worked, o’ course. Mules ain’t got no patience for engineering.

Higbie was about as practical as a left-handed corkscrew in a teetotaler’s house. But he had a heart of gold, even if it was tarnished like a prospector’s dreams after a dry spell. Always willing to share his beans, even when he looked like he hadn’t had a square meal in a month o’ Sundays. He was a storyteller, too, could spin a yarn long enough to rope a buffalo, filled with enough hyperbole to make Baron Munchausen blush. Every gopher hole he stumbled upon was a potential diamond mine in his telling, every prairie dog a disguised millionaire tryin' to avoid taxes.

I remember once he convinced a greenhorn fresh off the stagecoach that he could train rattlesnakes to herd sheep. Charged him a dollar a snake, he did. Don’t rightly know what became of that fella, probably back East telling tall tales o’ his own, only this time he was the punchline. Still, Higbie never meant no harm, just saw the world a little… sideways, I suppose. Like looking at a sunset through the bottom of a whiskey glass. A bit blurry, a bit distorted, but by damn, it still had its beauty. He was one o’ them necessary eccentrics that made the West so all-fired interesting, a reminder that even in the pursuit of gold, there was still room for a little foolishness, a little imagination, and a whole heapin’ helping of good-natured balderdash.
