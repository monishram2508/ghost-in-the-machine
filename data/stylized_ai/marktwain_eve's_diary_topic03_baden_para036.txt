Baden-Baden, they call it, a name so grand it trips over its own feet trying to impress you. I reckon the place is mostly steam and affectation, like a dowager lady fainting from the heat. You arrive, all dusty and travel-worn, expecting a bit of Germanic heartiness, but find instead a perfumed promenade teeming with folks who look as if they’ve swallowed a silver spoon whole. They parade past, their diamond brooches gleaming like a rogue’s grin, their poodles sporting haircuts fancier than mine. It's a grand spectacle, mind you, a regular circus of extravagance, but one starts to wonder if anyone actually *enjoys* themselves, or if they're just performing for the invisible judges of High Society. The baths, of course, are the main event, where the water, smelling faintly of rotten eggs and good intentions, is supposed to cure everything from gout to a surly disposition. I sat in one myself, stewing like a forgotten sausage, while a gaggle of Duchesses whispered about my unstylish bathing cap. The irony, you see, is that I was there hoping to cure a slight twinge in my knee, but I left with a far more pronounced ache in my sense of self-importance. One can’t help but feel a bit like a frog in a punchbowl at Baden. It's all glitter and bubble, and one spends most of the time desperately trying not to get accidentally swallowed by a passing Baroness. The architecture, too, is frightfully ornate, all curlicues and gilded cherubs, like a wedding cake gone berserk. One almost expects the buildings to start singing opera at any moment. All in all, Baden-Baden is a fascinating study in human vanity, a testament to the lengths people will go to in order to convince themselves, and each other, that they are having a perfectly splendid time. I wouldn't trade the experience, but I'd rather face a Mississippi mudslide than another afternoon tea amongst the diamond tiaras.
