Damascus, bless its ancient soul, is a city that'll charm the fleas off a camel, and confound the senses something fierce. Why, I reckon a man could spend a year wandering its alleyways and still come out the other side convinced he'd only seen the half of it, and that half, the deceptive kind. The guides, mind you, will tell you all about its biblical roots, its illustrious history stretching back to the dawn of time, and they'll do so with a straight face, too, which is a feat in itself. They'll point out the supposed spot where Cain slew Abel, though I suspect that particular spot shifts every few years, depending on which merchant stands to benefit from the tourist traffic. Then there's the street called Straight, a name so disarmingly honest in a city so delightfully crooked, it's enough to make a cynic like myself suspect divine intervention, or at least a very clever real estate agent from back in the day.

The bazaars, ah, the bazaars! A fellow can lose himself in a warren of carpets, spices, and shimmering silks, all while dodging donkey carts piled high with melons the size of a senator's ego. The merchants, a crafty bunch, they'll offer you tea and smiles, and then proceed to relieve you of your money with the skill of a seasoned pickpocket and the charm of a Mississippi riverboat gambler. You haggle, of course, it's practically an Olympic sport there, and you think you're getting the best of them until you get back to your hotel and discover you've paid twice what the thing is worth. But, bless your heart, you’ll not begrudge it; the journey, the performance of it all, it is well worth the fleecing. And the sounds! The calls to prayer echoing from the minarets, the clang of metal from the coppersmiths, the hawkers shouting their wares – it’s a symphony of organised chaos that both grates on the nerves and tickles the soul. And the smells! Incense, jasmine, roasted lamb, and something indefinable lurking in the shadows that smells suspiciously like a thousand years of undisturbed dust. It is a fragrant tapestry, though I'd advise against breathing too deeply near the tanneries. All in all, Damascus is a city of contradictions, a bewildering, beguiling, beautiful mess. A place where time seems to have taken a sabbatical, and where a fellow can feel both utterly lost and strangely at home all at once.
