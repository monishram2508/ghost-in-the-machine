Zermatt, you say? A village clinging to the hem of the Alps like a particularly persistent burr on a mountain goat's coat. Charming, they call it. Picturesque. As though a gaggle of chalet gingerbread houses all vying for attention from that preposterous Matterhorn, a stony-faced patriarch overseeing the whole shebang. And truly, it is charming, if you’re fond of inhaling air so crisp it might crack your dentures. One arrives expecting a sort of alpine Eden, only to be greeted by a parade of electric buggies zipping about like demented beetles, a most modern nuisance amongst such ancient grandeur. These contraptions, mind you, make a sound like a dentist's drill played in slow motion, adding a peculiar and unholy chorus to the otherwise serene mountainscape. The horses, bless their hearts, seem perpetually bewildered by the whole affair.

The people, ah, the people! A curious lot, bundled in furs that could clothe a small nation, many sporting spectacles perched precariously on noses turned pink by the altitude. One gets the distinct impression that half are trying to look effortlessly wealthy, and the other half are trying to look effortlessly sporty. And the skiing! A spectacle in itself, witnessing these daredevils careening down slopes as if gravity were a suggestion, not a law. Myself, I prefer to observe this ballet of risk from a safe distance, preferably with a glass of something warming and the faint hope that the next avalanche chooses someone else.

The shops! Oh, the shops, a veritable cornucopia of cuckoo clocks, chocolate with ludicrous price tags, and enough Swiss Army knives to equip a small invading army. One suspects that if the Matterhorn ever decided to topple over, the entire village could be armed and ready to defend it with an arsenal of bottle openers and tiny, yet surprisingly effective, saws. All in all, Zermatt is an experience, a delightful, if slightly absurd, collision of the past and the present. A place where one can admire the majesty of nature whilst simultaneously dodging electric buggies and pondering the existential question of why a cuckoo clock needs to cost more than a new pair of boots.
