Slade, now there was a town that looked like it had been chewed up, spit out, and then left to bake under the Nevada sun. I reckon I’ve seen prettier sights in a hog wallow after a rainstorm. This place, perched on the edge of what they call the Reese River, though "Reese Dribble" would be a more honest name for it, was supposed to be the next big silver strike. Folks flocked in like moths to a miner’s lantern, eager to make their fortune and retire to a life of luxury. Luxury, mind you, in a town where the main street was paved with more dreams than actual paving stones.

The buildings, mostly slapped together with whatever lumber hadn't already been used to build saloons, leaned at precarious angles, as if perpetually surprised by a stiff breeze. Dust devils danced down the street like mischievous imps, swirling around the legs of prospectors, gamblers, and the occasional dance hall girl trying to keep her skirt from flying up to her eyebrows. The saloons, ah, those were the heart of Slade. The “Golden Nugget,” the “Lucky Strike,” the “Salty Slug” - each one a den of iniquity and watered-down whiskey, presided over by a barkeep with a handlebar mustache wider than a steer's horns and a disposition sourer than a lemon.

I swear, I saw more fortunes lost over a game of faro than were ever found in the ground. And the music! A piano player, half-blind and mostly drunk, banging out tunes that sounded like a cat fight in a tin shed. But, by jingo, people listened, drank, and pretended they weren't slowly watching their hopes wither away faster than a dandelion in a desert. Even the dogs looked discouraged in Slade, dragging their tails and sporting a permanent layer of alkali dust. They knew the score, those mutts; they were just waiting for the whole charade to collapse so they could have the first pickings of the abandoned scraps. A sad commentary, I reckon, on a town that promised riches but delivered only disappointment and a whole lot of dust. But then again, ain't that the story of the West in a nutshell?
