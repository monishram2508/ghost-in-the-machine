Slade, now there's a town that could give Sodom and Gomorrah a run for their money, though I reckon those ancient cities probably had better-stocked saloons. Why, when I first lumbered into that den of iniquity, fresh off the stagecoach and green as a gourd, I swear I saw a dogfight in the middle of the street settled not with a whip, mind you, but with a Colt revolver. And nobody batted an eyelash. Seems that was just Tuesday. The mud was thicker than molasses in January, the air choked with coal dust and the reek of unwashed humanity, and the only greenery to be seen was the moss growing on the north side of the gallows. You’d think they’d have the good sense to hang folks a bit further away from the main drag, seeing as it put a damper on a man’s appetite for breakfast, which consisted mostly of bacon so tough you could resole a boot with it.

The townsfolk, well, they were a breed apart, all squinty eyes and trigger fingers itching for a reason. I saw more men wearing six-shooters than wearing smiles, and I wouldn’t wager a plugged nickel on the sanity of any one of ‘em. Gamblers, prospectors with dust in their beards and dreams in their eyes (though mostly nightmares, I suspect), and ladies of the evening whose rouge was thicker than the paint on a Mississippi steamboat, all mingling in a cacophony of curses, spittle, and tall tales. It was said that Slade was a good place to lose your money, your reputation, and possibly your life, all before suppertime. I wouldn't argue with that assessment one bit. Left me wondering how the place managed to keep afloat, I mean it was practically a purgatory of questionable businesses and shifty characters. I left Slade with a lighter pocket, a heavier heart, and a firm resolution to stick to towns where folks argued with their fists instead of their firearms. A man's sanity is not worth that level of drama, even for the sake of research.
