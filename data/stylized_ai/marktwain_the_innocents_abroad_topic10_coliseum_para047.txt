Now, this Coliseum, bless its crumbling heart, is a spectacle and a sham, all rolled into one grand, dust-choked package. They call it a monument to Roman glory, do they? Glory, I say, is a fine word for the tourists to bandy about as they haggle over trinkets depicting gladiators frozen in eternal combat. But let’s be honest, this ain't no church, or even a proper tavern. It's a stone husk of a blood sport emporium. Imagine, if you will, building a structure the size of a small mountain, just so folks can watch fellas in loincloths poke each other with pointy sticks. It's barbaric! Though, I reckon, a right diverting sort of barbarism for a fella with an idle afternoon.

They say lions used to roam its sandy floors, tearing apart poor Christian souls while the emperor nibbled on grapes. Now, I wouldn’t doubt the lions for a minute; I’ve seen some of the local cats, and they look like they’d fancy a Christian soul or two themselves. But the emperor and the grapes? That smacks of exaggeration, like a politician’s promise. More likely, he was swilling cheap wine and betting heavily on which gladiator would last the longest. And I wouldn't blame him. Watching a good gladiator at work is better than hearing some politician run his mouth any day.

The place is riddled with echoes, you know. Echoes of cheers, of screams, of steel against bone. And probably, if you listen closely enough, echoes of ancient bookies collecting their debts. I wouldn't be surprised! All that pomp and ceremony, all that “Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant” nonsense, boiled down to men hitting each other, for the entertainment of the masses. Sounds suspiciously like Congress to me. Still, you can't deny the sheer, brute impressiveness of the thing. A man could spend a lifetime just counting the stones, and still have time to get in a decent card game later. Just be sure you avoid the ghosts of the bookies, lest you find yourself paying debts that are several centuries overdue.
