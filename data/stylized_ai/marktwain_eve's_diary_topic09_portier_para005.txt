Now, a portiere, as the French are wont to call it, though why they couldn't just say "door curtain" like sensible folk is beyond me, is a thing of wonder, and sometimes, a thing of downright suspicion. You see it hanging there, all heavy velvet or embroidered tapestry, blocking the draft like a spinster blocking a proposal. One minute, the drawing-room is a picture of domestic bliss, Papa reading the newspaper, Mama humming over her embroidery, the canary chirping like a mechanical toy gone mad. The next, that portiere sways, ever so slightly, and you just know, you just *know*, that young Mildred is eloping with the stable boy, or that Aunt Hortense is sneaking off for another nip of brandy, despite promising Reverend Peabody she'd sworn off the spirits.

It's a cloak for secrets, a curtain for clandestine meetings, a stage for the theater of the absurd that is family life. Why, I recollect once seeing a portiere absolutely bristling with suspicious movement. Turns out, it was only the cat, attempting to scale the thing to reach a rogue fly, but for a moment, I was convinced a small revolution was brewing behind those folds. They are, in essence, the ideal co-conspirator, a silent observer to all the family's peccadilloes. They see it all, you know. The hushed arguments, the stolen kisses, the surreptitious eating of forbidden sweets. And they never tell. Not a peep. Though I wouldn't put it past them to whisper secrets to the moths; those creatures are notoriously gossipy, and anything is possible in this world of ours. The portiere, in short, is less a piece of decor and more a character in the ongoing drama of domesticity, a plush, inscrutable confidante whose silence speaks volumes. And heaven help you if you happen to catch your bustle on one while attempting a discreet exit; you'll be exposed quicker than a politician caught in a lie. Trust me, I know.
