Now, a sepulchre, you see, is just a fancy word for a tomb, a final lodging house for those who’ve shuffled off this mortal coil, as the Bard so eloquently put it. But it ain’t just any tomb, mind you. Oh no, a sepulchre has pretensions. It’s the sort of tomb that wouldn’t be caught dead associating with a common grave. Think of it as a gilded cage for the deceased, a rather permanent sort of hotel, if you will, though I wager the room service is terrible. They're often hewn from solid rock, or built with more ornamentation than a Mississippi steamboat, all in the name of showing off the dearly departed’s earthly success, or more often, the living relatives' desperate need to impress.

You’ll find them crawling with cherubs, those chubby little nuisances always looking suspiciously pleased with themselves, and enough marble to bankrupt a small country. Epitaphs, of course, are mandatory, those little slices of immortality where the deceased is invariably described as virtuous, noble, and possessing a wit sharper than a freshly honed razor, regardless of whether they were actually a cantankerous old miser with a personality resembling a rusty nail. I’ve always suspected those epitaphs are written by someone who never actually met the subject. Probably some poor scribe paid by the word, who figured the dead wouldn’t complain about a little flattery.

And the irony of it all! Here lies a fella, presumably beyond caring about worldly possessions, entombed in a testament to worldly excess. One can almost imagine the poor chap, trapped inside his opulent rock box, scratching his spectral head and muttering, "All this for me? I would have been just as happy with a nice, quiet hole in the ground and a bottle of whiskey.” Still, I reckon it keeps the stonecutters employed, and provides a good object lesson for those of us still breathing: work hard, amass a fortune, and then die so someone can stick you in a ridiculously overpriced hole in the ground. What a life!
