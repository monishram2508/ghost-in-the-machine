Now, Damascus, there’s a city that fancies itself ancient, and ancient it undoubtedly is, though whether it's got the wrinkles to prove *all* of its claimed years, I’ll leave to the professors with their calipers and dusty tomes. They say it saw Cain raise his club against poor Abel, might even have been the very smithy that forged the infernal thing! I wouldn't swear to it, mind you, as I wasn’t present at the creation, though I’ve certainly endured sermons that felt just about as long. The town is choked with history, layered thick as baklava, and just as sticky. Every corner you turn, some fellow with a beard longer than my arm is eager to tell you about Saladin or Saint Paul, generally at a price, naturally.

The streets, bless their winding souls, are so narrow that two stout camels meeting head-on would likely find themselves in a right pickle, having to reverse and jostle like politicians debating a particularly thorny issue. The bazaars are a riot, a kaleidoscope of colors, smells, and hawkers yelling propositions that would make a bishop blush. Silk scarves piled higher than haystacks, spices potent enough to wake the dead, and enough brass trinkets to outfit a small army, all screaming for your attention, and your hard-earned lira. You can’t walk five paces without being offered a cup of coffee, blacker than sin and strong enough to stand a spoon in; and if you accept, you're guaranteed to be engaged in a debate about the price of olives until the sun goes down. I swear, the citizens of Damascus could haggle the angels out of their harps.

And the Damascenes themselves? A shrewd lot, to be sure, with a twinkle in their eye that suggests they know something you don’t, and are just waiting for the opportune moment to profit from it. But they're generous, too, in their way; offer you a seat, a story, and a puff from the nargileh, if only to better gauge how susceptible you are to a slightly inflated price on that antique dagger you’ve been eyeing. All in all, Damascus is a grand old fraud, a theatrical production played out on cobblestones, but a spectacle worth the price of admission, even if you end up parting with more than you intended. Just hold onto your wallet, and remember, a smile and a healthy dose of skepticism are the best weapons in any traveler's arsenal, particularly in a place as cunning and captivating as Damascus.
