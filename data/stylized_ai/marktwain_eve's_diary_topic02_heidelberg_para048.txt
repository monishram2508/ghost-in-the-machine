Heidelberg, ah, Heidelberg! A town that clings to the Neckar like a lovesick burgher to his stein. One arrives expecting a somber, grey, scholarly sort of place, overflowing with chin-scratching professors and dusty tomes, and one finds, instead, a cheerful riot of red roofs jostling for space beneath the benevolent gaze of a spectacularly ruined castle. This castle, mind you, is not merely a ruin; it's a ruin of the *first* water, a crumbling colossus that seems to have been struck by lightning, cannon fire, and a particularly virulent strain of architectural indigestion, all at once. One half expects a disgruntled giant to pop his head over the battlements and grumble about the poor quality of the local cobblers. The students, bless their youthful hearts, are everywhere, seemingly immune to the melancholic air that hangs over such a historical site. They swagger about in bright colors, fueled by beer and perhaps a touch of youthful arrogance, carving their initials into every available surface as if the very stones of Heidelberg are their personal autograph book. And speaking of beer, one must sample the local brew, of course. It flows freely, washing down enormous sausages and mountains of sauerkraut with an enthusiasm that rivals the Neckar's own current. The river itself, a lazy, green serpent winding through the valley, is a constant source of amusement. You see gondola-like boats plying its waters, filled with tourists attempting to look romantic and succeeding only in appearing slightly seasick. One cannot help but wonder if the Neckar isn't secretly chuckling to itself, observing the human comedy unfolding on its banks. All in all, Heidelberg is a delightful hodgepodge of the grand and the ridiculous, a place where history rubs shoulders with hedonism, and where even the most learned professor is not above enjoying a good sausage and a stein of beer in the afternoon sun. It’s a place that, like a well-aged wine, only improves with acquaintance, leaving one with a warm feeling of contentment and a slight, entirely forgivable, inclination to carve one's own initials somewhere inappropriate.
