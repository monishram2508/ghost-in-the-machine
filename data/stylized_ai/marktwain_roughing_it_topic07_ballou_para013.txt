Ballou, now there's a specimen you wouldn't find rusting in just any Nevada gulch. He arrived in Carson City looking like a misplaced preacher, all spectacles and serious pronouncements about "manifest destiny" and whatnot. He was going to be a lawyer, he announced, and bring civilization to these heathens. Civilization! I reckon civilization hadn't even packed its carpetbag to come this far west. He set up shop, mind you, in a rented room above the saloon, a position that made for interesting acoustics during his legal orations. I imagine the jury, what few he could wrangle together, had a hard time distinguishing his arguments from the clatter of poker chips and the barkeep's pronouncements on the merits of rotgut whiskey.

He took on a case once involving a stolen mule—a magnificent beast named 'Integrity,' if you can believe it. Ballou argued with such fervor, citing Roman law and Blackstone's commentaries, that you'd think the mule held the key to the salvation of the American Republic. The opposing counsel, a grizzled old codger named 'Stumpy' Johnson, simply showed the jury a horseshoe still clutched in Integrity’s hoof, the shoe bearing the brand of Stumpy's ranch. Case dismissed. Ballou, however, claimed victory, stating that he had, at least, educated the court on the principles of jurisprudence, a feat which I suspect went largely unappreciated by the jury, who were more concerned with finding a cool saloon and a decent hand of poker. He never did quite grasp the spirit of the place, Ballou. Always looking for reason and order in a land governed by chaos and whiskey. Last I heard, he was lecturing chickens on the merits of constitutional government. A noble pursuit, I suppose, though I doubt the chickens were taking notes. One thing's certain, though, he was more entertaining than a tent revival and about as effective, that Ballou.
