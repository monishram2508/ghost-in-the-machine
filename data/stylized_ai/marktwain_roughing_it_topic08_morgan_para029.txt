Now, Morgan, there was a specimen. A fellow you wouldn’t find etched on a dime, unless the Mint had taken to stamping characters instead of just presidents and eagles. I met him down in Virginia City, a place so rough it made a badger look like a drawing-room dandy. He claimed to be a prospector, though I reckon he’d sooner prospect for a free drink at the nearest saloon than chip away at solid rock. Morgan had a beard like a tangled bird's nest, perpetually dusted with quartz and dreams that never quite hatched. He walked with a lopsided gait, owing, he said, to a run-in with a claim jumper and a particularly stubborn mule, though I wouldn’t bet a plugged nickel on either claim. His eyes, however, those were something else. They twinkled like distant stars on a moonless night, hinting at a sharp mind buried beneath layers of tall tales and cheap whiskey.

He was a walking encyclopedia of useless information, from the proper way to pan for gold (which, judging by his own bank account, he clearly didn't know) to the mating habits of the Sierra Nevada ground squirrel. And he was a storyteller, bless his heart, with a voice like gravel gargling molasses. He could spin a yarn so thick you could choke on it, filled with fantastical creatures, hidden treasures, and hair-raising escapes, all while maintaining a perfectly straight face. You never quite knew if he was pulling your leg or recounting a genuine experience, but frankly, it didn't matter. The entertainment was worth the price of the beer I occasionally bought him – a sum, I suspect, that constituted the majority of his income. Morgan, a rascal he was, but a rascal I’d gladly share a campfire and a bottle with any day of the week. A man who proved that even in the dusty, unforgiving heart of the West, there was still room for a little bit of good-natured humbuggery.
