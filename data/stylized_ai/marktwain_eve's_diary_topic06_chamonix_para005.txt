Chamonix! Ah, a nest of human ants scrambling up and down a mountain of such preposterous height, one wonders why the Almighty bothered. It appears to me that the only purpose of this monstrous Alp, this Mont Blanc, is to inspire awe in the beholder, and perhaps a healthy dose of vertigo. The very air is thin, like the patience of a long-suffering husband confronted with an overflowing hatbox. One sees these ambitious souls, strapped into contraptions of rope and metal, looking for all the world like flies caught in a particularly elaborate spiderweb, inching their way upwards. They tell you it's for the view, the exhilaration, the conquest of nature. But between you and me, I suspect it's mostly for bragging rights at the local tavern, where they can hold court, pontificating about crevasses and avalanches to an audience hanging on their every word, most likely fueled by copious amounts of that potent liqueur that tastes suspiciously like pine trees and regret. The town itself is a delightful chaos of chalets, each seemingly trying to out-gingerbread the next. Tourist hordes throng the streets, laden with skis, cameras, and an astonishing array of brightly colored puff jackets that rival a field of particularly flamboyant tulips. One almost expects to see a sign that reads, "Caution: Avalanche of Consumerism Imminent." And the prices! Mercy me, one pays a king's ransom for a simple fondue, which, while undeniably delicious, hardly justifies the expenditure. But one forgives it all, eventually. For even a cynic like myself cannot deny the majesty of those snow-capped peaks, piercing the heavens with a silent grandeur that makes one feel, if only for a fleeting moment, as though the world is, despite its many absurdities, a rather splendid show indeed. Just try not to look down.
