Winter in the Sierras? Well, now, there's a topic to warm a fella's insides, or at least make him wish he had a few more layers between his hide and the elements. We're talking about a season that ain't shy about showin' off, mind you. Not a gentle nudge of frost on the pumpkins, no sir. We're talkin' blizzards that'd bury a church steeple and winds that could peel the bark off a pine faster than you can say "Jack Robinson." People get all poetical about the beauty of snow, and I reckon there's something to that – that pristine, untouched canvas of white. Until, that is, you gotta shovel it, or better yet, try to navigate it with a mule team draggin' a wagon filled with supplies. Then the poetry just melts away faster than a politician's promises.

The days shrink up like a prune left out in the sun, and the nights? Lordy, they stretch out longer than a preacher's sermon on the virtues of temperance. You spend most of your time huddled around a fire, trying to decide whether you're colder inside or out. And the silence! You can hear a mouse sneeze a mile away, and the echo of a distant coyote howl makes you wonder if he’s laughin' at your predicament. The wildlife either hibernates or gets bolder than a saloon owner on payday. You'll find bears clawing at your cabin door lookin’ for a handout, squirrels tryin' to turn your roof into a nut storage, and mountain lions strollin' by as if they own the place. It's a regular Noah's Ark of hungry, desperate creatures, all thinkin' you're their personal buffet. Of course, the upside is that it gives you somethin’ to talk about, and a few yarns to spin 'round the campfire when the spring thaws finally roll around. That is, if you survive the winter to tell the tale.
