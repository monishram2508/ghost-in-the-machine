Now, these Mormons, you see, they’re a curious bunch, thick as tumbleweeds in a Utah dust storm, and just about as unpredictable. I stumbled upon their Zion once, a place called Salt Lake City, and a right pretty sight it was, what with all the tidy farms and well-irrigated gardens, sprouting like miracles out of that arid landscape. You’d almost think they’d conjured it all up with some hocus pocus, like Brigham Young himself, bless his polygamous soul, waved a magic wand and said, "Let there be alfalfa!" 

They’ve got this book, see, the Book of Mormon, which they swear is gospel truth, dropped right out of heaven and translated from reformed Egyptian. Now, I ain't learned in them ancient tongues myself, but I figure if an angel can deliver it to a farmer lad in New York, it must be something special. They believe in prophets aplenty, revelations raining down thicker than locusts in summertime, and enough baptisms to fill the Great Salt Lake twice over.

They’re hard workers, though, can’t fault them that. Industrious as beavers, building temples taller than any cathedral I ever saw, and spreading their missionaries thicker than fleas on a prairie dog. Polite, too, most of 'em. Always ready with a smile and a tract, trying to convince you that your one wife ain't nearly enough to guarantee a spot in the celestial kingdom. I reckon they see the world as one big conversion project, and by golly, they're persistent! Mind you, I wouldn't trade my whiskey for a celestial mansion, but I'll give them credit, they certainly have a conviction, so firm it could make a mule balk twice before trying to move it. And let me tell you, that's something.
