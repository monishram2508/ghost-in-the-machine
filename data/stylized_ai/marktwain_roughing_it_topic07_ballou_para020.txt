Ballou, now there was a specimen fit to be enshrined in a museum alongside Barnum’s “Feejee Mermaid” and the Cardiff Giant. He arrived out West, mind you, fresh from some Eastern seminary, looking as bewildered as a hen in a hailstorm. Dressed, he was, in a suit so black it seemed to absorb all the sunlight around him, which, out here, is a considerable accomplishment. He claimed to be a lawyer, but I suspected he knew less about the law than a jackrabbit knows about the binomial theorem. I swear, I once saw him argue with a mule – and the mule, bless its stubborn heart, nearly won. He had a habit of quoting scripture at the most inappropriate moments, usually when he'd just lost a hand of poker or tripped over a particularly ornery rattlesnake. It was as if he thought the Good Book could charm the venom right out of the critter. 

And gullible? Well, if you told Ballou that the moon was made of green cheese and populated by little men playing banjos, he'd probably ask you what kind of cheese and if he could buy one of the banjos. He tried his hand at mining, naturally, lured by the siren song of silver. He spent weeks digging in a gopher hole with the tenacity of a badger, convinced he'd struck a lode richer than Comstock’s. All he found was dirt, a couple of confused earthworms, and a crippling case of backache. But bless his heart, he never lost faith, not entirely. He kept saying something about "trials and tribulations building character." I figured he was building enough character to fill a whole library, and most of it was the kind that'd make you wince. Still, you couldn’t help but like the fella. He was so utterly, hopelessly, and spectacularly unsuited to the West that he was almost charming. He was a walking, talking, quoting-scripture-while-falling-down advertisement for why some folks are just better off staying East.
