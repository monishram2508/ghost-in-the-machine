Well, I declare, if there’s one thing that needs a bit of explainin’, it’s this here contraption they call a portiere. Seems to me like mankind’s persistent habit of tryin’ to improve on Perfection, seein’ as how a plain ol’ door served perfectly well for centuries. Now, a door’s got its sense about it, keeps the drafts at bay, the nosey neighbors out, and announces itself with a satisfying click or a dramatic slam, depending on your disposition. But a portiere? A portiere just sort of… hangs there, like a flapper's beads gone wrong. 

They say it’s for elegance, that a heavy drape adds a certain air of sophistication. But frankly, I've seen more sophistication in a hog wallow after a rainstorm. It's meant to suggest a grander division between rooms, I suppose, but it achieves the same result as a child hiding behind a curtain; everyone knows you're still there. And the trouble they go to! All that velvet and tassels and embroidery, looking for all the world like a Gypsy’s discarded finery. Why, I saw one once with enough fringe to outfit a small army of can-can dancers! 

And the inconvenience! You can't just walk through a portiere like a civilized soul. You have to part it, gently, like unveiling a sacred relic, or worse, wrangling with a particularly stubborn bedsheet. Heaven forbid you’re carrying a teacup, because that fabric has a knack for snatching at delicate porcelain. And woe be unto the unfortunate soul who attempts to sneak past it in the dead of night. That rustling and swishing will alert every slumbering soul within a mile radius, and your clandestine mission will be as secret as a town crier’s announcement. No, sir, I say stick with a door. A door's honest. A door's predictable. A door doesn’t pretend to be something it ain’t. A portiere, on the other hand, is just tryin' too hard.
