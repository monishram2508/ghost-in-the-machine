Gibraltar, bless its little heart, is a sight to behold, though perhaps not for the faint of traveler. Perched upon the very arse-end of Spain, it puffs itself up like a ruffled grouse, this British possession clinging to the Iberian Peninsula with the tenacity of a lovesick limpet. One can't help but chuckle at the sheer absurdity of it all. Here you have a place steeped in sunshine, where the language spoken is a hodgepodge of English, Spanish, and enough sailor slang to make a parrot blush, all lorded over by a regiment of scarlet-coated soldiers who look as bewildered as a kitten in a coal mine. The main street, you see, is a veritable bazaar, crammed tighter than a politician's promises with shops hawking everything from duty-free gin to tawdry trinkets fit only for pigeons to admire. And the apes, ah, the Barbary apes! They roam about with an air of proprietorship that would make Queen Victoria herself feel like a mere tenant. They are, I suspect, the true rulers of this rocky outcrop, deigning to tolerate the presence of humanity so long as we continue to provide them with peanuts and photograph opportunities. One clambers up the Rock, gasping for air like a landed whale, and is rewarded with views that stretch clear across the Strait of Gibraltar to the murky shores of Africa. A grand panorama, to be sure, though truth be told, one suspects the view from atop a respectable haystack in Kansas might be just as pleasing to the eye, and certainly less arduous on the posterior. But there it is, Gibraltar. A curious anomaly, a historical oddity, a delightful absurdity, and a place where one is quite likely to be relieved of one's pocket watch by a cheeky monkey while simultaneously being sold a dubious "genuine" Spanish shawl by a suspiciously Cockney hawker. Such is the nature of travel, is it not? A blend of wonder, bewilderment, and the distinct possibility of being fleeced by someone with a dazzling smile and a talent for persuasive patter.
