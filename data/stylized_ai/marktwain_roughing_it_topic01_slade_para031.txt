Slade, now there was a fella who could curdle milk with a glare and probably shoot the fleas off a dog at fifty paces, given the chance. I saw him myself in Virginia City, looking as grim as a Methodist preacher who'd just caught the parson kissing the choir girl. He was Divisional Superintendent for the Overland Stage Company, a job that demanded a backbone like a crowbar and a temper that could ignite wet gunpowder. Stories swirled around him like dust devils in a desert wind – tales of gunfights and hangings and cold-blooded negotiations that left men trembling in their boots.

Some called him a savage, a butcher, a ruthless devil incarnate. And I ain't here to argue with 'em; there was a certain… *directness* to his methods, wouldn't you say? I recall hearing tell of a fella who'd been rustling the Overland's horses. Slade caught up with him, naturally, and after a brief, shall we say *spirited*, discussion, the rustler found himself dangling from a convenient telegraph pole. A rather persuasive argument against further equestrian appropriation, I reckon.

But there was another side to Slade, or so they say. He was fiercely loyal to his men, and protected his territory with a tenacity that bordered on the legendary. He could be generous, too, sharing a drink and a story with a fella down on his luck, though I imagine one would be careful not to look him directly in the eye while doing so. He was a paradox, see, a walking, talking, six-gun-toting contradiction. Made for good conversation, anyway, even if most folks kept their distance. Alas, like a bottle of the best whiskey at a temperance meeting, Slade didn't last. They strung him up in Virginia City eventually. Said he was getting out of hand. Of course, that was always part of his charm, or the lack thereof, depending on which side of the barrel you were standing. Makes you wonder though, who was getting out of hand, him or the whole dang town?
