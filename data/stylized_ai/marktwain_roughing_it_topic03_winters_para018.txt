Winters in this neck of the woods, why, they're a spectacle, ain't they? A regular humbug of ice and snow, just when you think the world's settled into a comfortable routine of sun-baked dust and grasshoppers the size of your thumb. Now, I ain't one to complain about the weather, seeing as how complaining about it's about as useful as trying to herd squirrels with a rusty bucket, but I'll tell you what, winter has a knack for showing a fella just how small and insignificant he really is. You wake up one morning and the whole blessed landscape is draped in a shroud of white, looking as pristine and innocent as a newborn babe. Don't let that fool you though, because beneath that innocent veneer lies a cold-hearted villain, ready to nip at your nose and freeze the marrow in your bones.

The wind, now that's another character entirely. It howls and moans like a banshee with a toothache, finding every crack and crevice in your cabin to sneak through, bringing with it a chill that could curdle milk faster than you can say "Jack Frost." And the snow? Well, it starts out all fluffy and picturesque, perfect for postcard scenes and romantic sleigh rides... until you're knee-deep in it, trying to shovel your way to the outhouse, and suddenly it's about as romantic as a badger in your bedroll. Folks try all sorts of contraptions to combat the cold, from wrapping themselves in enough furs to resemble a walking haystack to imbibing copious amounts of "medicinal" whiskey. Some swear by it, others just end up snoring by the fire with a smile on their face, dreaming of warmer climes and perhaps, a summer where the grasshoppers don't require a saddle to ride. But come spring, when the snow melts and the first wildflowers peek through the mud, you almost, just almost, forget the trials of winter. Almost. Then you remember the ice fishing and the tall tales told around the pot-bellied stove, and you have to admit, even a humbug winter has its charms, like a grouchy old uncle who secretly slips you a silver dollar when nobody's looking.
