Brigham, now there was a fellow cut from a different bolt of cloth entirely. A prophet, they called him, though I reckon he prophesied more wives than rain. I saw him once, perched atop a wagon like a king on a hay bale throne, a man of substance, you understand, built on a foundation of faith, hard work, and, well, more wives than I could shake a stick at. He had that look in his eye, the kind that could convince a desert rat to swim the Great Salt Lake for a single grain of sand. Salt Lake City, that's his doing, you know. He looked at the desolate valley and declared, "This is the place!" Like he’d misplaced his spectacles and stumbled upon it by accident. And bless my soul, if it didn’t turn into a blooming oasis. Irrigation ditches everywhere, neat little houses, and a general air of industry that would make a hornet's nest look lazy.

But let me tell you, that whole polygamy business caused more dust-ups than a saloon brawl on Saturday night. The gentiles, they couldn't cotton to it, not one bit. Said it was against the grain, an affront to decency, and all that. Of course, Brigham, he just smiled that knowing smile of his and said something about the Lord providing. He always did have a way of smoothing things over with a biblical quote or two. He had a temper like a prairie fire when roused, they say, but I never saw it. Mostly, he just seemed tired, weighed down by the burden of leading all those people, keeping the peace, and remembering all those darn wives’ names. Makes a man wonder if paradise is truly worth all the trouble, wouldn’t you say? Still, you had to admire the man’s grit. He built a city in the wilderness, defied the government, and left a legacy that folks are still arguing about to this very day. A scoundrel? Maybe. A visionary? Undoubtedly. A fellow who knew how to keep himself busy? Well, that’s just plain gospel.
