Now, about this business they call "bucksheesh," a word that rolls off the tongue like a pebble down a dusty road. It's a universal language, understood better than any fancy French phrase in these parts, and spoken fluently by every soul from the lowliest beggar to the pompous pasha himself. One might call it bribery, and some do, with a virtuous sniff that curls their mustaches skyward. But that's a harsh judgment, I reckon. Bribery implies something illicit, something hidden in the shadows, whispered behind cupped hands. Bucksheesh, on the other hand, is as open as a bazaar on market day, shouted from the rooftops with a wink and a knowing smile. It oils the wheels of progress, so to speak, or at least keeps them from grinding to a complete and utter halt.

Imagine, if you will, a donkey cart stuck in the mud. You could yell at the beast until your lungs give out, you could flog it till its hide resembles a tattered flag, but that cart ain't movin' until you slip a handful of dates to the owner. Suddenly, that donkey finds reserves of strength it didn't know it possessed! It's the same with everything else. Want your luggage to arrive without a "mishap"? A little bucksheesh to the porter does wonders. Need a permit from the governor? A small "gift," properly presented, can smooth the way like a well-oiled scimitar. It's not that these people are inherently corrupt, mind you. It's just that they’ve learned that a little grease makes the world spin a whole lot easier. Besides, these officials aren't paid a king's ransom, more like a pauper's pittance, so who can fault them for supplementing their income with a bit of "consideration?" It's a system, you see, a well-established custom, and trying to buck against it is like trying to stop the Nile with a teacup. You might make a splash, but you ain't changing the course of the river. So, embrace the bucksheesh, I say. Learn to haggle, learn to smile, and learn to accept that in this part of the world, a little bit of "persuasion" goes a long, long way. You'll be richer for it, both in pocket and in peace of mind.
