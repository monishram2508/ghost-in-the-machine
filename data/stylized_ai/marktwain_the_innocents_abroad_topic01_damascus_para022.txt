Damascus, ah yes, the storied city! Why, they claim it's the oldest inhabited city in the world, though I suspect a few stubborn cockroaches down in some ancient cistern might dispute that claim. One pictures them, the cockroaches, drawing straws to decide which one gets to be the official representative, arguing about historical precedent and lineage in their squeaky, minuscule voices. Anyway, Damascus. They say it's a pearl of the Orient, and I suppose if one has a particular fondness for dust, blinding sunlight, and the persistent aroma of donkeys, then pearl it is! I've seen more convincing pearls in a ten-cent gumball machine, myself. The streets are a veritable labyrinth, designed, I presume, to frustrate any Westerner arrogant enough to think he can navigate without a guide. One wanders and wanders, convinced he’s retracing his steps, only to find himself, an hour later, staring at the same spice merchant trying to convince him that saffron cures baldness and loneliness both. The merchant, bless his entrepreneurial heart, has a twinkle in his eye that suggests he might believe it himself, or at least, he believes it's worth a try on a gullible tourist. The buildings, now, they're something. Ancient, certainly. Some are so ancient they appear to be held together by little more than wishful thinking and centuries of accumulated pigeon droppings. You half expect a crumbling minaret to wink at you and offer you a discounted rug. And the people! A curious mix of stoicism and flamboyant hospitality. They’ll offer you sweet tea laced with enough sugar to tranquilize a rhinoceros, and then proceed to haggle over the price of a brass teapot as if their very survival depended on it. It's a charming sort of theater, though, and one can’t help but admire their tenacity, even if it leaves one feeling slightly swindled and utterly exhausted. Truly, Damascus is a city that assaults the senses, then proceeds to offer you a cup of sugary tea to recover from the attack. A peculiar place, indeed, but a peculiar place worth seeing, if only for the stories it’ll furnish you with afterward, and the opportunity to argue with cockroaches about historical accuracy.
