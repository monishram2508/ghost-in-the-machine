Brigham, ah, Brigham Young. A fellow whose wives, they say, could populate a respectable sized town, perhaps even a burgeoning state if he’d truly put his mind to it. A man of the desert, mind you, though I can’t say the desert was particularly fond of him, seeing as how he insisted on irrigating it and turning it into, well, another place entirely. Salt Lake City, they called it, a name as inspiring as a sack of potatoes. A city built on faith and furrowed brows, where the air hung heavy with the scent of piety and, if the wind was right, the faint aroma of brewing root beer. I reckon he figured, rightly or wrongly, that if you couldn’t find gold in the mountains, you could at least find salvation on the plains. He’d led his flock across half a continent, dodging plagues of locusts, existential crises, and the occasional hostile Indian. Not that he considered them particularly hostile, mind you, just…misunderstood. He seemed to have a talent for misunderstanding things himself, particularly those things concerning the fairer sex and the proper number of them a man required.

He was a stern sort, Brigham, with a beard like a badger and eyes that could bore a hole through a mountain, or at least a particularly stubborn mule. He spoke his mind, which was often a dangerous habit, especially when his mind was preoccupied with divine instruction and the proper layout of the celestial kingdom. One might argue his methods were… unconventional, perhaps even a tad tyrannical, but then again, so was crossing the Great Plains in a handcart. He ruled with an iron fist encased in a velvet glove, or maybe it was the other way around. Hard to tell with these religious fellas, ain’t it? They speak of love and forgiveness, then build empires with an eye towards eternal damnation for anyone who disagrees. Brigham, he was a force of nature, a human dam diverting the river of progress to his own, divinely appointed, purposes. And whether you saw him as a prophet or a charlatan, a saint or a sinner, you had to admit, he built something out of nothing, which, in this world of ours, is a feat more impressive than finding a gold nugget the size of a house.
