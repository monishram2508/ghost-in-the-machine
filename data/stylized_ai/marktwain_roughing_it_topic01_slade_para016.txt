Slade, now there's a town that could give Sodom and Gomorrah a run for their money, though likely with fewer angels and a great deal more saloon brawls. I rode in on a stagecoach that was practically held together with spit and prayers, and the whole town felt about the same. Dust, sir, so thick you could carve your name in it, and the air heavy with the scent of cheap whiskey and unwashed ambition. The buildings were mostly wooden affairs, leaning like weary gamblers after a losing streak, and the inhabitants? Well, they looked like they'd been whittled from the same rough timber. You could spot a hard case a mile off - the sort that kept a hand perpetually hovering near their holsters, just in case someone got the bright idea to dispute their claim to a particularly grimy corner of the bar.

Of course, I heard all sorts of tall tales. Murders committed over a hand of cards, fortunes made and lost in a single night, and enough gunfights to populate a dime novel. Whether they were true or not, I couldn't say, but they certainly added a certain flair to the place. I even saw a fella try to pay for his supper with a gold nugget he claimed to have found just outside of town. The barkeep, a man with a face that looked like it had been used to break rocks, just squinted at it, bit it, and declared it "fool's gold." The poor fella slunk out, tail between his legs, presumably to try his luck at the next saloon. And that, I reckon, sums up Slade pretty well. A town built on hope and desperation, where fortunes are made and broken with alarming regularity, and where a man's word is only as good as the pistol at his hip. I wouldn't recommend settling down there for a quiet life, but if you're looking for a story, or maybe just a bit of adventure, you could do worse than spending a night or two in Slade. Just be sure to keep your hand close to your own pistol, and maybe order a water with that whiskey. You never know what might crawl out of the woodwork after dark.
