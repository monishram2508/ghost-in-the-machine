Well, I declare, if there ain't something queer about these glaciers, something downright unnatural. One minute you're admiring a mountain, standing firm and proud, and the next thing you know, a great hunk of ice, looking like it’s been gargling with milk of magnesia for a century, comes a-creeping down, slow as a Sunday sermon. And they call it "glacial pace," do they? As if a turtle couldn't outrun the thing with a week's worth of naps thrown in for good measure! I reckon if you planted a row of posies in front of one of those icy behemoths, you could have a proper bouquet before it bothered even to wrinkle a single petal.

Now, the professors, bless their cotton socks, they try to tell you it's all about snow and compression and the mystical dance of thermodynamics, but I say it's just nature being contrary, like a mule with a burr under its saddle. They'll show you pictures of these glaciers, grand and imposing, looking like frozen waterfalls that got stuck halfway down, but don't let them fool you. Up close, they're just a muddle of slush and grit, riddled with cracks and groans like an old man complaining about his rheumatism. And the colour! They go on about the "azure depths" and "sapphire hues," but mostly, it's the colour of dishwater after a particularly greasy meal. Still, I suppose there's a certain fascination in watching something so ponderously slow just grind away at the landscape. Makes a body feel right quick and sprightly, almost like you could outrun eternity itself. Course, then you realize eternity's probably just a glacier in disguise, inching its way towards you when you least expect it, and the humour just sorta dries up, don't it?
