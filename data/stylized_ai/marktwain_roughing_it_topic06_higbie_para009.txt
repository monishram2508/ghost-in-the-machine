Higbie, now there was a specimen fit to be stuffed and perched upon a mantelpiece as a warning to all tenderfeet who thought they could scratch gold out of the bosom of Mother Earth with a butter knife and a hymn. Higbie, you see, he wasn't what you'd call a natural miner. More like a natural disaster, some might say. He had this theory, bless his optimistic soul, that all the gold was just sittin' right below the surface, practically beggin' to be scooped up. Now, anyone with half a brain (and I reckon most jackrabbits possessed that much in these parts) knew that wasn't the case. But Higbie, he was convinced. He’d spend his days diggin’ holes like a gopher on a caffeine binge, each one exactly the same size and depth as the last, and each one just as devoid of the glinty stuff. 

He swore he was always just “inches away” from striking it rich. Inches, I tell you! By his calculations, he’d have bored a tunnel straight through to China by now if he’d kept diggin' in a straight line. And the tools! He treated his pickaxe like it was a delicate tea cup, tap-tap-tapping at the rockface as if afraid to wake the gold slumbering beneath. And his shovel! Why, I’ve seen men wield a feather duster with more gusto. He’d try to charm the gold out, he would, talkin’ to the ground like it was a shy maiden he was courtin’. “Come on, little nuggets,” he’d murmur, “show yourselves to Higbie, and he’ll buy you the finest silks and satins you ever did see!” And of course, nothin’. The gold, it seems, preferred the company of men who actually broke a sweat. But bless Higbie. He never lost his faith, not even when he was knee-deep in dust, covered in grime, and lookin' more like a scarecrow than a prospector. He was the kind of fella who could find optimism in a rattlesnake pit, and that, I reckon, is a talent in itself.
