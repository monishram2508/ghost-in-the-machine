Zermatt, you see, is a place of such peculiar charm, it quite takes a body aback. Perched amidst those Alps, as grand as they are jagged, it's a village entirely innocent of the internal combustion engine's racket. Not a motorcar to be found, mind you, only these electric buggies, looking for all the world like overgrown toys driven by gnomes with a dreadful sense of purpose. And the air! Why, it's so crisp and clean, it feels like drinking champagne with every breath. One expects to find angels flitting about, polishing the stars, although I confess I haven't yet spotted one.

The Matterhorn, of course, presides over it all, a perpetually frowning giant daring you to climb it, though I wouldn't dream of such a folly. I prefer to admire it from a safe distance, preferably with a glass of something warming in my hand. The locals, bless their sturdy souls, seem unfazed by its majesty, going about their business of catering to the hordes of tourists, bless their wallets. They speak a German dialect so thick, one could spread it on bread and call it a meal, and they’re always ready with a yodel and a smile, which is quite disconcerting when you are from Hartford. 

One can't help but feel a touch of pity for the cows, you know, burdened with those enormous bells around their necks, clanging a discordant symphony as they wander the slopes. It's enough to drive a sensitive soul mad, though I suspect the cows are used to it by now. They are the only inhabitants who seem to truly belong. And the tourists! A veritable kaleidoscope of nationalities, all decked out in their finest ski attire, looking as though they stepped out of a fashion plate. You'd think they were going to a ball rather than a snowdrift. But Zermatt has something for everyone. Even those, like myself, who are perfectly content to sit and watch the world go by, provided the world includes a well-stocked bar and a view that could inspire even the most jaded of poets.
