Now, these Mormons, bless their peculiar hearts, are a breed apart, ain’t they? Found ‘em thick as fleas on a mangy hound out in Utah Territory, a land God must’ve misplaced while he was busy creating Yosemite. Brigham Young, a fella with more wives than hairs on a grizzly, had them building a city upon a hill, or rather, a dusty plateau, expecting the heavens to open and whatnot. Seemed a trifle ambitious, even for a man who could sprout children faster than a potato field could sprout spuds. They were all work and no play, those Mormons. Always irrigatin’ and plowin’ and prayin’, with nary a poker game or a saloon brawl to liven things up. One might think they were trying to out-virtue the angels, and from the looks of some of their sermons, they probably fancied themselves halfway there already.

Their religion, well, it’s got enough angles to keep a geometry professor busy for a lifetime. Golden plates, buried angels, and a prophet who could find water with a divining rod and convert sinners with a withering stare. They believed in things that would make a spiritualist blush, and they defended it all with the fervor of a badger cornered in a root cellar. You'd argue about the Book of Mormon with one of ‘em, and before you knew it, you’d be knee-deep in theological quicksand, wonderin’ where your afternoon went and how you got roped into such a doggone discussion in the first place. But you couldn't help but admire their grit, their sheer stubbornness. They might believe some fantastical notions, but they believed 'em with all their might, and that, I reckon, counts for something in this world where half the people don't believe in anything at all, not even the price of beans going up next Tuesday.
