Glaciers, those majestic rivers of ice, are powerful agents of erosion and deposition, shaping landscapes over millennia. They form in regions where snow accumulates faster than it melts, compacting under its own weight into dense glacial ice. This ice, under the relentless pressure of gravity, begins to flow, albeit at speeds that can range from a few centimeters to several meters per day. The movement is influenced by factors such as the ice thickness, the slope of the underlying bedrock, and the temperature of the ice itself, warmer ice being more pliable. As a glacier moves, it sculpts the terrain beneath it. The process of abrasion occurs as the ice, laden with rocks and debris frozen within it, grinds against the bedrock, smoothing and polishing the surface and creating striations – telltale scratches indicating the direction of glacial flow. Plucking, another crucial erosional process, involves the glacier freezing onto loose rocks and sediments on the valley floor and sides, then tearing them away as it continues to advance. This process is particularly effective on the lee side of bedrock obstacles, contributing to the formation of the characteristic “roche moutonnée” – a rock formation with a smoothed, gentle slope on the upstream side and a steep, plucked face on the downstream side.

The materials eroded and transported by glaciers are eventually deposited, forming distinctive landforms. Moraines, ridges of unsorted sediment (till) deposited at the edges of a glacier, mark the extent of its advance. Terminal moraines, the most prominent, delineate the glacier's farthest reach, while lateral moraines run along the sides of the glacier. When the glacier retreats, it can leave behind ground moraine, a blanket of till spread across the valley floor. Meltwater streams flowing from the glacier also play a significant role in deposition, creating outwash plains composed of sorted sediments. Kettle lakes, formed by the melting of buried ice blocks, dot these plains, adding to the diverse landscape sculpted by these icy behemoths. The study of glaciers provides valuable insights into past climate conditions and sea-level changes, and their ongoing retreat in response to global warming serves as a stark reminder of the profound impact of human activities on the Earth's environment.
