Now, this Coliseum, this…ah, this grand old ruin, it is a sight to behold, though perhaps not in the way those gushing travel guides would have you believe. They’ll tell you of the majesty, the glory, the echoing roars of the crowd, the sweep of history. Which is all fine and dandy, of course, if you have a powerful imagination and a penchant for being roasted alive in the Roman sun. Fact is, the majesty is mostly dust these days, a fine powder that coats your nostrils and settles on your mustache like a pathetic, grey toupee. And the glory? Well, the glory is mainly a testament to the Romans’ remarkable talent for building things that would eventually crumble into picturesque heaps, perfect for postcards and philosophical musings.

One can, of course, imagine the lions and gladiators, the blood and sand, the screaming hordes. But I suspect the reality was rather less…organized. I picture the lions, bored witless after weeks of being poked with sticks, probably opting to nap in a shady corner rather than engage in mortal combat. And the gladiators, bless their sandal-clad souls, likely spent most of their time grumbling about the unfair pay and the questionable quality of the wine. And the crowd, well, they probably argued amongst themselves about the best seats, the price of sausages, and whether or not that senator's toga was truly the height of fashion. It's just human nature, after all, and I doubt even a Roman amphitheater could change that.

And now, of course, it is filled with tourists. A sea of cameras and selfie sticks, each one trying to capture the perfect angle of ruin and reflection. They wander about, squinting in the sun, their guidebooks clutched tight like sacred texts. They whisper reverently, or at least, as reverently as one can whisper whilst dodging tour groups from Osaka and Dusseldorf. And one can’t help but wonder, as they clamber over the crumbling stone, if they are truly seeing the Coliseum, or merely a shadow of its former self, refracted through the lens of time and their own preconceived notions. Perhaps, in the end, the real spectacle is not the ruin itself, but the spectacle of humanity attempting to make sense of it all, clutching their cameras and guidebooks, forever chasing after a ghost of a bygone era.
