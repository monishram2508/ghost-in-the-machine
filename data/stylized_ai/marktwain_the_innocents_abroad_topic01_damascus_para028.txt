Now, Damascus. Lord bless you, Damascus! A city that's seen more sunrises and more rascals than a Mississippi steamboat gambler on a winning streak. They call it the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, you know. Makes a fellow wonder what sort of real estate agent managed *that* long-term con. Probably promised perpetual sunshine and conveniently left out the bits about conquering armies showing up every other Tuesday.

I reckon you could dig anywhere in Damascus and come up with a rusty Roman helmet, a broken Crusader sword, and a receipt for a really dodgy rug all in the same shovelful. Speaking of rugs, you'd best hold onto your wallet tighter than a Presbyterian deacon on collection day. The merchants there, they smile at you like you're their long-lost brother, then try to sell you a camel blanket that smells faintly of goat and probably cost them a nickel to make for a small fortune. But bless their hearts, they do it with such charm and good humor that you almost admire the audacity of it all.

And the streets! Why, they're so narrow and twisted a rat wouldn't know which way to run to escape a cat. You’ll find yourself rubbing shoulders with veiled women, grumpy looking men in fezzes, and donkeys laden down with more oranges than seems physically possible. It's a right proper circus, I tell you, only nobody bothers to charge admission. Just watch your feet; you're liable to trip over a sleeping dog, a discarded water pipe, or maybe even a sultan’s forgotten slipper if you're particularly unlucky. And if you're a fella inclined to airs and graces, best leave 'em back in Paris. Damascus has no time for fancy-pants shenanigans. It's a city that lives and breathes and occasionally smells a bit like spices and sewage, and I say that with a touch of fondness, mind you. It's got character, that city does, more than you could shake a stick at. Character enough to forgive the swindling and the smells and the fact that you're probably going to get lost at least three times before lunchtime. Yes sir, Damascus, she’s a real piece of work.
