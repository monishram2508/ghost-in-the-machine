Zermatt, you say? A village clinging to the foot of the Matterhorn like a lovesick barnacle to a grand galleon. Now, I’ve seen mountains aplenty, enough to make a fellow’s neck ache just thinking about craning it skyward, but this Matterhorn, well, she’s a regular flirt, showing off her craggy bits and snowy bosom to every tourist who dares to point a camera. And point they do! Like a rabid dog spotting a juicy bone, these picture-takers click and whir, each convinced they’ve captured the mountain’s soul. Bah! They’ve captured a sliver of light on a rock, and no more. The true soul of Zermatt resides not in the mountain, but in the absurd contraption of its transportation system. They’ve got these little electric carts, putt-putting around like over-caffeinated beetles, ferrying the well-heeled and the woefully lost to and fro. One imagines the inventor had a severe allergy to walking. And the horses! Poor beasts, pulling carriages laden with luggage that could sink a small ship, their eyes glazed over with a mixture of boredom and existential dread. One almost feels like offering them a stiff drink and a philosophical treatise on the futility of labor. The shops, naturally, overflow with trinkets designed to separate the tourist from his francs. Cowbells that clang with the subtlety of a blacksmith’s hammer, cuckoo clocks that threaten to drive one mad with their incessant chirping, and chocolates shaped like the aforementioned mountain, presumably so one can symbolically devour the landscape. And the air! Crisp and clean, a stark contrast to the smoky haze of civilization, it practically begs you to gasp and exclaim about its purity. Which, of course, everyone does, right before lighting up a cigar that undoes all the good. Zermatt, you see, is a charming paradox, a place where nature’s grandeur meets man's relentless pursuit of comfort and souvenir-hunting. It’s a stage, really, and we, the tourists, are merely actors, stumbling about in our fancy ski-pants, playing our roles in this elaborate alpine farce.
