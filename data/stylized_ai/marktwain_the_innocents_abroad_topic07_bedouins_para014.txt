Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked hides, are a curious lot, and no mistake. One stumbles upon them out in the Arabian desert, you see, looking for all the world like tumbleweeds that sprouted legs and a penchant for haggling. They’re draped in cloth that's seen more sunrises than Methuselah, and their eyes, Lord love ‘em, are sharper than a pawnbroker’s when sizing up a diamond. They claim kinship with the wind, these fellows, and I’ll grant you, they move across the sands with a peculiar grace, their camels swaying like ships on a particularly grumpy ocean. One minute they’re there, squatting around a meager fire brewing some potent, muddy coffee that’d make a mule kick, and the next, they’ve vanished into the shimmering heat haze, leaving only the faintest trace of their passage, and perhaps a stray camel hair or two.

Their concept of time, mind you, is looser than a politician’s promise. “Soon” can mean anything from the next sandstorm to the second coming, and punctuality is a virtue known only in textbooks and the dreams of foreign diplomats. Try arranging a meeting with a Bedouin chief at precisely 3 o’clock and you’ll find yourself swatting flies and contemplating the existential dread of the desert silence until, oh, sometime after the sun’s given up the ghost for the day. Their hospitality, though, is a thing of wonder. Offer them a cigarette, and they’ll likely smoke it down to the filter, then offer you the stub back, just to be polite. Share your water, and they’ll recount your generosity to their grandchildren for generations. Just don’t, I implore you, try to understand their kinship systems. It's more tangled than a bowl of spaghetti wrestled by a pack of kittens, and attempting to decipher it is a surefire recipe for a headache the size of the Pyramids. They’re a resourceful bunch, these desert wanderers, squeezing a living from a land that most folks wouldn't give a nickel for. And when all’s said and done, there’s a certain poetry to their existence, a resilience that puts our pampered, civilized ways to shame. Though, I still wouldn't trade my hotel for their tent, not unless they throw in a decent air conditioner and a room service menu.
