Brigham, now there was a fellow cut from a different bolt of cloth than most, and probably ordered enough cloth to outfit a small army. He had that serene look of a man who'd stared down the barrel of more trouble than a Mississippi steamboat pilot sees in a fog, and emerged on the other side with a conviction solid enough to build a temple out of – which, incidentally, he practically did. Salt Lake, mind you, was a howling wilderness when he planted his flag there, a desert so barren a jackrabbit would pack a lunch before crossing it. But Brigham, with a twinkle in his eye that suggested either divine inspiration or a talent for swindling the desert into blooming, declared it was the place, the promised land, and darned if he didn't start turning it into something resembling a garden spot.

Of course, his methods were about as subtle as a brass band in a church. Irrigation ditches snaked across the landscape like giant earthworms, coerced into existence by the sheer force of his will and the sweat of a thousand weary saints. And speaking of saints, Brigham, bless his polygamous heart, was practically running a holy breeding farm. Reports varied, naturally, depending on who you were asking and how close they were to the man's good graces, but let's just say his family gatherings must have resembled a small town council meeting. Some called him a prophet, others a tyrant. Personally, I reckon he was a bit of both, a shrewd businessman draped in religious rhetoric, a man who could quote scripture with the fervor of a revivalist preacher while simultaneously haggling over the price of lumber with the cunning of a riverboat gambler. One thing's for sure, though: he had gumption. He took a bunch of folks, mostly greenhorns and idealists, and forged them into a society out there in the middle of nowhere, a society that, for all its peculiar ways and Brigham's heavy hand, endured. Now, whether that's a testament to divine providence or just plain stubbornness, well, that's a question best left to theologians and philosophers to squabble over whilst I enjoy a quiet cigar.
