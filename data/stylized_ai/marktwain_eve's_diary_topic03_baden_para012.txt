Baden-Baden, they call it, Baden-Baden. Twice the Baden for twice the bathing, I presume, and twice the chance of tumbling into a steaming pot of your neighbor’s ailments, which, I assure you, are as plentiful as the marble columns holding up the place. It’s a town built for the ailing rich, those poor souls whose livers have cried uncle after a lifetime of champagne and overindulgence, and whose doctors, smelling money a-plenty, have declared that only the waters of Baden-Baden can save them. Save them, I say, or pickle them nicely for the winter months. One sees such a fascinating parade of humanity here, a veritable menagerie of pampered fragility. Lords and ladies, weighed down by jewels and despair in equal measure, hobbling along the Lichtentaler Allee as though fearing the pavement might suddenly bite. I’ve never witnessed so much suffering displayed so publicly and so lavishly. They limp, they sigh, they consult quack physicians who promise rejuvenation for a fistful of francs – rejuvenation being, in this instance, the temporary ability to hobble *slightly* faster towards the inevitable.

And the baths themselves! Oh, the marvels of modern engineering applied to the art of public stewing. Imagine, if you will, a room shimmering with tiles, populated by pale, pudgy people resembling nothing so much as slightly overripe plums submerged in lukewarm consommé. They bob and they float, discussing their gout and their grievances, their inherited estates and their imminent demise, all the while convinced they are achieving some sort of spiritual cleansing along with the physical. One chap, a portly Baron von something-or-other, confided to me that the waters were particularly good for his ‘humors.’ I was sorely tempted to suggest he try a bit of humor *with* his waters, but decorum, alas, prevailed. Of course, one must concede that the air *is* invigorating, being a heady mix of pine trees and sulfur, and the local wine, while not exactly ambrosia, is certainly potent enough to make one forget, for a time, that one is surrounded by a collection of the walking wounded. Baden-Baden, then, a monument to the fleeting nature of earthly pleasures and the enduring human desire to postpone the inevitable – ideally with a glass of something sparkling and a fluffy towel.
