Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a restorationist religious tradition that originated in the United States in the 19th century. It was founded by Joseph Smith, Jr., who claimed to have received divine revelations that led to the translation of the Book of Mormon, which Latter-day Saints believe to be another testament of Jesus Christ and a companion scripture to the Bible. This narrative sets the stage for a unique theological framework encompassing both familiar Christian concepts and novel doctrines. Central to Mormon belief is the idea of a premortal existence, a divine plan of salvation allowing for eternal progression, and the potential for humanity to become like God. Latter-day Saints emphasize the importance of family, community, and adherence to a strict moral code, often refraining from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. The Church is structured hierarchically, with lay members serving in various leadership positions, and missionaries, often young adults, proselytizing worldwide.

Mormon history is marked by periods of intense persecution and migration, most notably the trek westward to Utah under the leadership of Brigham Young, following Smith's death. In Utah, they established a thriving community and practiced polygamy, a controversial doctrine that ultimately led to conflict with the U.S. government. The Church officially discontinued the practice of polygamy in 1890, although splinter groups continue to practice it. Today, the Church is a global organization with millions of members worldwide, actively engaged in humanitarian work, education, and cultural preservation. While the Church maintains a conservative stance on many social issues, it has also made efforts to promote interfaith dialogue and engage in public discourse. Latter-day Saints often view themselves as a chosen people with a unique mission to gather Israel and prepare the world for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. They emphasize personal revelation, temple worship, and adherence to the teachings of living prophets and apostles, who they believe continue to receive divine guidance for the Church in the modern era. Despite ongoing scrutiny and diverse interpretations of their beliefs, Mormonism continues to evolve and contribute to the religious landscape.
