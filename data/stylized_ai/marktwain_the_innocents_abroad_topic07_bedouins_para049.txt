Now, these Bedouins, bless their wandering souls, are a breed apart, a bit like a tumbleweed with a pulse and a penchant for camels. One fancies they spring fully formed from the desert sands, draped in enough cloth to sail a small boat, ready to squint at the sun and haggle with the devil himself for a cup of coffee. They roam about, you see, as if possessed by some invisible landlord, their tents pitched beneath a sky so vast it makes a man feel smaller than a flea on a pharaoh's backside. I've seen city folk attempt to imitate their stoicism, but they invariably wind up looking like a camel trying to thread a needle, all awkward angles and frustrated sighs. 

They possess, mind you, a peculiar code of honor, intricate as a spider's web woven in a sandstorm. One might think a life spent dodging scorpions and thirst would render a man stingy, yet they’ll offer you the last of their water with a generosity that puts even the most pious preacher to shame. Of course, should you then try to steal their camel, well, let's just say you'd be wishing you’d stayed home embroidering samplers. Their tales! Lord, the stories these fellows can spin around a campfire! Tales of jinn and forgotten cities, of daring raids and miraculous escapes, each one embellished enough to make Baron Munchausen blush with envy. I swear I once heard one claim to have traded a goat for a flying carpet, but he winked so hard, I suspected he was pulling my leg longer than a giraffe's neck. And their coffee! Bitter as a politician's promise, but potent enough to keep you awake for a week, or until the next sandstorm buries you alive, whichever comes first. All in all, a peculiar bunch, these Bedouins, but entertaining, like watching a dog chase its tail in the desert, if not necessarily profitable.
