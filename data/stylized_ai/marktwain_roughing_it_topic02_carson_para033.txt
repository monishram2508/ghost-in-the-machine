Carson City, you say? Why, bless your heart, that ain't no city; it's more like a freckle on the vast, leathery hide of Nevada. I reckon I spent a spell there, back in the day, when the sagebrush was thicker than the hair on a miner's chest, and the silver glittered brighter than a politician's promise. A feller could wander those dusty streets, kickin' up more tumbleweeds than opinions, and not see a soul 'cept maybe a stray dog lookin' for a handout or a politician sniffin' for a vote, which ain't much different if you ponder it.

Now, Carson boasted a capitol building, a respectable enough pile of stone for a place where laws were hatched like hen eggs. The inside, though, was another matter. You'd find more lawyers and lobbyists swarmig' about than flies on a molasses jug. They had all the persuasive charm of a sidewinder, and about as much moral fiber, too. I swear, a man could walk in there with a decent plot of land, and walk out with nothin' but a receipt for taxes on air he was breathin'.

The population, well, it consisted of miners down on their luck, merchants lookin' to make a buck, and more fellers nursing a grudge than there were saloons to drown them in. Sundays were quiet, except for the occasional gunshot that might’ve been a disagreement settled, or maybe just a dog getting too close to a backyard hen. Evenings, the air would fill with the tinny music from the hurdy-gurdies, and the murmur of tall tales being traded over a glass of something that tasted suspiciously like turpentine mixed with ambition. Yes sir, Carson City. It's a place where a man could make a fortune or lose his shirt, and most likely do both before breakfast. A quaint, sun-baked, and utterly unremarkable spot, and yet, somehow, I always seem to find myself a little homesick for it every now and then. Go figure.
