Well, I spent a spell in Salt Lake City, and Lordy, those Mormons are a curious lot. I ain't saying they're bad folk, mind you, just... different. See, they’re industrious as beavers building a dam, and neighborly as a hound dog wagging its tail. They built that city right out of the desert, mind you, turned a desolate wasteland into something resembling Eden, if Eden came with irrigation ditches and Brigham Young's portrait on every wall. They do say they can make a desert bloom like a rose, but I reckon it takes a whole lot of praying, hard work, and a hefty supply of water rights.

Now, about this here polygamy business - well, it used to be a regular part of the show, didn't it? A man could have more wives than a sultan has pillows. I heard tell of one fella with so many wives he needed a map just to remember their names and which one cooked the best biscuits. Of course, the government folks frowned upon all that, and after a good bit of squawking and threatening, the Mormons promised to cut it out. They say they don’t practice it anymore, wink wink nudge nudge. But I wouldn't be surprised if there's still a few hidden cabins up in the mountains where the old ways are clinging on like burrs to a saddle blanket. 

Their religion, well, that's a whole other kettle of fish. Angels and golden plates and a whole lot of scripture that'd make a preacher dizzy. They believe in things that'd make your hair stand on end, and then they go and live more honest and upright lives than most folks I know. It's a puzzler, I tell you, a real head-scratcher. But you gotta hand it to 'em, they believe in what they believe with all their hearts. And when a body's that convinced, well, it's hard to argue with 'em, even if you *do* think they're buying snake oil by the barrel.
