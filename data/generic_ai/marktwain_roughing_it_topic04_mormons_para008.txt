Mormons, formally known as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, trace their origins back to the early 19th century and the prophet Joseph Smith. Smith claimed to have received golden plates from an angel, which he translated into the Book of Mormon, a scripture considered supplemental to the Bible and a key text in Mormon theology. This event, along with other revelations Smith received, formed the foundation for the Latter-day Saint movement. Central to Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, meaning that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets, not just those of the ancient past. They believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ and his atoning sacrifice, much like other Christian denominations, but differ in their understanding of the Godhead, viewing it as three distinct beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. Mormons also have a unique understanding of the afterlife, believing in three degrees of glory within the celestial kingdom, the highest level achievable only through adherence to specific commandments and ordinances, including temple marriage. Family plays a vital role in Mormon life, and temples are sacred spaces where members participate in ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, believing they can help deceased ancestors receive the blessings of the gospel. Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often dedicating one to two years of their lives to proselyting and sharing their faith around the world. Latter-day Saints typically adhere to a strict code of conduct known as the Word of Wisdom, which discourages the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, and encourages a healthy lifestyle. While their historical practices, such as polygamy, caused significant controversy, the Church officially discontinued the practice in 1890. Modern Mormonism emphasizes community involvement, strong family values, and a commitment to living a Christ-centered life. They maintain a distinct cultural identity, often marked by a strong emphasis on education, service, and a deep-seated belief in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
