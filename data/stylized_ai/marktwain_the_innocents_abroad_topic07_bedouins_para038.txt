Now, these Bedouins, you see, are a breed apart, and a sandy one at that. They roam this blasted Arabian desert like tumbleweeds with opinions, draped in more cloth than a traveling salesman selling upholstery samples. Imagine, if you will, a fellow whose house is a camel-hair tent, perpetually pitched in the middle of nowhere, and whose backyard stretches to the very edge of civilization, a boundary which, let me tell you, is a rather fuzzy affair out here. They’re tougher than a boiled boot, these fellows, surviving on dates and camel milk, and an apparent disdain for anything resembling a fixed address. Why settle down when you can wander aimlessly for years? Makes a fellow wonder if they lost something important a long time ago and are still looking for it, though I suspect it’s merely an aversion to paying property taxes.

They’ll greet you with a smile as warm as the desert sun, offer you tea that's strong enough to wake the dead, and then proceed to haggle over the price of a rug with a tenacity that would make a New York pawnbroker blush. A rug, mind you, that looks suspiciously like it was woven by a one-eyed camel using its tail. And their hospitality? Well, it's legendary, bordering on excessive. They’ll share their last crust of bread with you, even if you suspect that last crust is older than Methuselah, and keep you talking about the glory of your ancestors until the stars are out. Just try not to mention the regrettable habit of wearing all that wool in hundred-degree heat, or they might just offer to sell you a camel at a “special friend” price. They are, in short, a walking, talking, bargaining anachronism, a reminder that even in this modern age of steam engines and telegraph wires, there are still folks out there who prefer the open road, a good camel, and the endless horizon. Though, between you and me, I suspect half of them are secretly dreaming of a nice, air-conditioned room and a cold glass of lemonade.
