Now, about these mosques, these grand houses of devotion, eh? I reckon they're quite the spectacle, these places. Domes sprout from the earth like colossal, gilded pumpkins, pointing towards the Almighty, or maybe just showing off a bit – can't quite be sure, can we? They're all minarets, too, thin and spindly, like the architect was trying to reach heaven on a shoestring budget. You’d think with all that height, they'd have installed lightning rods, but maybe they figure divine intervention trumps earthly precautions.

Inside, it's a different world altogether. Carpets softer than a politician's promise sprawl across the floor, all geometric patterns and floral what-nots. And the arches! Arches within arches, twisting and turning like a lawyer trying to explain a contract. One can’t help but feel a tad dizzy navigating the place; it's like walking through a kaleidoscope designed by a mathematician with a penchant for symmetry. And then there's the call to prayer, that unearthly wail that echoes through the city. I’m told it's a beautiful summons, and perhaps it is, but to my ears, it sounds a bit like a distressed cat arguing with a rusty gate. Not that I’m complaining, mind you. It’s all part of the local colour, adds a bit of exotic spice to the humdrum of life. It reminds you, you see, that somewhere, somehow, somebody believes in something with a fervor that would shame a fire-and-brimstone preacher. And that, I suppose, is something worth looking at, even if you don't understand it. Just don’t ask me to take off my shoes; I've grown rather attached to them, and frankly, I'm not entirely confident in the condition of my socks. A man’s got to have some dignity, even when confronted with the divine.
