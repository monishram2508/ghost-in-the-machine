Higbie, now there's a specimen fit for a museum, though likely one of curiosities rather than fine art. A man built like a stack of poorly seasoned lumber, all sharp angles and unexpected splinters. He hailed from parts unknown, somewhere back East where folks apparently spoke in a tongue only decipherable by cattle and tax collectors. A taciturn soul, Higbie was, though when he did deem to open his pie-hole, it was generally to complain about the price of beans or the infernal racket the coyotes were makin' at three in the mornin'. He claimed to be a silver prospector, a claim I entertained about as seriously as I entertained the notion of a winged pig roosting on the church steeple. Prospectin', in Higbie's case, consisted mostly of sittin' on a rock, lookin' mournful, and occasionally kickin' at the dirt with a boot that looked like it had lost a fight with a badger. He had a burro named Betsy, a creature equally as disagreeable as her owner, and together they formed a partnership that was a marvel of mutual misery. I suspect they communicated through a series of grunts and sighs that expressed a shared disappointment with the world. Higbie never struck silver, not that I ever witnessed, but he did manage to unearth a whole heap of grievances and complaints. He was a master of the art of disgruntled observation, remarking on the sorry state of the weather, the laziness of the lizards, and the general depravity of mankind. Yet, behind that perpetually sourpuss demeanor, I reckon there was a flicker of something akin to humor, or maybe it was just indigestion. Either way, Higbie was a fixture, a part of the landscape, like a particularly stubborn sagebrush, and life in that dusty corner of Nevada wouldn't have been quite the same peculiar circus without him. One might even say, with a generous heapin' of exaggeration, that he was almost… endearing, in a mangy, flea-bitten sort of way.
