Now, a portier, mind you, is a thing that hangs. Not like a condemned man, bless his heart, but more like a stubborn cobweb, determined to stay put no matter how much you huff and puff with your feather duster. We had one once, a grand affair of crimson velvet, so heavy you’d wager a small fortune it was stuffed with iron filings and disgruntled bees. It hung betwixt the drawing-room and the hallway, ostensibly to keep out drafts. Ostensibly being the key word there, because that portier leaked drafts like a sieve leaks water, only colder, more insistent, and carrying with it the faint, lingering scent of Mrs. Higgins’ prize-winning petunias, which, frankly, smelled more like damp earth than any flower has a right to. 

Adam, being a practical sort, saw it as an affront to good sense. "Why hang a wall,” he'd declare, his voice booming like a thunderclap in a teacup, "that does less to keep out the weather than a hummingbird's wing?" I, of course, being of a more sentimental bent, saw it as a source of amusement. One could, for instance, hide behind it and startle unsuspecting guests, which I confess I did on several occasions, much to Adam's chagrin. He claimed it was undignified. I countered that dignity was a highly overrated virtue, particularly when one could achieve such delightful results by simply uttering a well-timed "Boo!" from behind a curtain. 

The portier eventually fell victim to the moths, those industrious little devils. We discovered them one morning, feasting upon the velvet like it was a Thanksgiving feast. Adam declared it a victory for common sense. I, however, felt a pang of something akin to sorrow. After all, it had provided us with endless entertainment, however ridiculous. And besides, without the portier, where was I to hide when the vicar came calling with his droning sermons and his insistent inquiries about the state of my immortal soul? Perhaps I’d just take up residence behind the sofa cushions. A woman’s gotta have her secrets, you know.
