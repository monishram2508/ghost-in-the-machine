Higbie, a name synonymous with both a rich maritime history and a tragic chapter in the annals of naval service, evokes a complex tapestry of associations. Primarily, it refers to the USS Higbee (DD-806), a Gearing-class destroyer commissioned in 1945, just as World War II was drawing to a close. Though spared from the major naval battles of that conflict, the Higbee embarked on a distinguished career, serving in various roles throughout the Cold War and the Vietnam War. Her post-war duties included deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and the Western Pacific, participating in exercises and demonstrating the U.S. Navy's presence in strategic regions. However, the Higbee's most significant and enduring mark was made in Vietnam, where it actively engaged in Operation Sea Dragon, shelling North Vietnamese coastal targets in an effort to interdict supply lines and disrupt enemy movements. It was during this operation, on April 19, 1972, that the Higbee became the first U.S. Navy warship to be directly damaged by enemy action in the Vietnam War. A North Vietnamese MiG-17 dropped a 250 kg bomb which struck the ship's aft 5-inch gun mount, causing significant damage and injuring several crew members. Despite the damage, the Higbee remained operational and continued its mission, showcasing the resilience of its crew and the ship's robust construction. The event remains a poignant reminder of the risks faced by American sailors during the conflict. Beyond the specific incident of being struck, the Higbee's service in Vietnam exemplifies the broader role of destroyers in providing gunfire support, escorting convoys, and conducting anti-submarine warfare. The Higbee was eventually decommissioned in 1979 and sold for scrap, but her legacy persists through the stories of the men who served aboard her and the historical record of her contributions to naval operations. The name "Higbee," therefore, stands as a testament to both the dedication of naval personnel and the enduring significance of destroyer warfare in modern naval history.
