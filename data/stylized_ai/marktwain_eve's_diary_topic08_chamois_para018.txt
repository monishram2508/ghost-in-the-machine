Now, about this chamois. It’s a beast, I tell you, a veritable mountain goat masquerading as something…well, nobody’s quite sure *what*. Eve was endlessly fascinated by them, naturally. "Oh, Adam," she’d coo, "look at the dear, nimble creatures prancing about on yonder precipice! Are they not exquisite proof of a loving Creator's whimsical nature?" Me, I saw dinner, or at the very least, a decent pair of gloves. But Eve, bless her heart, was never one for practicality when faced with a creature of… questionable hygiene and undeniably pointed horns. 

They're built, these chamois fellows, like a perpetual question mark. All lean muscle and wary eyes, always poised to bolt off the cliff face at the slightest provocation. Makes a fella feel downright clumsy, trying to track 'em. And the noise they make! A sort of bleating grunt that’s both mournful and irritating, like a leaky bellows attached to a grumpy old goat. Eve would mimic it, of course, claiming she was “communing with the wild things.” I suspect she just enjoyed making fun of me when I couldn’t quite manage the same throaty squawk. 

She once tried to train one, did Eve. Found a little orphaned thing, all legs and fluff, and named him “Percy.” Percy, naturally, was a menace. He chewed on my fig leaf briefs, terrorized the butterflies, and developed a peculiar fondness for butting Eve in the rear. The last straw, if you'll pardon the pun, was when Percy ate the entirety of our nascent garden. Eve, heartbroken but also slightly bruised, decided Percy was better off with his own kind. She released him back into the mountains, where, I suspect, he's currently terrorizing another unsuspecting Adam with his capricious ways. And me? Well, I’m still trying to coax the radishes back to life, whilst dreaming of a nice, warm chamois stew. But don't tell Eve that. She'd have my hide, and I reckon I'd prefer that to becoming chamois food myself.
