Slade, now there's a name that rattles around the skull like a loose marble in a cathedral. Used to be, folks spoke of Slade with a certain reverence, tinged with enough dread to curdle milk at fifty paces. Why, they said, he was the king of the road, a two-legged terror with a pistol that sang sweeter than a choirboy on Christmas morn. I'd heard tales, of course, the kind that grow taller with each telling, like corn in the summer heat. Stories of stagecoach robberies so audacious they’d make Jesse James blush, and scores settled quicker than a prairie fire. One yarn I recall spun by a grizzled prospector claimed Slade once shot a feller for snoring too loud in a saloon. Likely a bit stretched, but you never knew for certain with that crowd.

Then I actually saw him, or at least, what was left of him. Found him in Virginia City, not astride a wild mustang with a six-shooter blazing, but slumped in a chair like a sack of potatoes that had seen better days. He was still a hefty specimen, mind you, but the fire had gone out of his eyes, replaced with a dull, watery gaze that seemed to look right through you and into the bargain basement of your soul. He’d put on weight too, something fierce, and his celebrated sidearms were gathering dust under a greasy newspaper. Turned out the folks of Virginia City, tired of his particular brand of “law and order,” had decided to string him up one fine morning. Seems they had a hankering for a quieter existence, and Slade, bless his heart, was hindering that endeavor something awful. So, they took him down from his perch, relieved him of his worldly possessions, and sent him on his way to the Great Beyond. A real comeuppance for a man who thought he could outrun destiny, I reckon. Goes to show you, even the toughest coyote eventually gets caught in the trap. And ain't that a lesson worth chew'n' on?
