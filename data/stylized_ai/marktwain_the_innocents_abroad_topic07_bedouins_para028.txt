Now, the Bedouin, bless their sun-baked hides, are a breed apart, a bit like a tumbleweed with a will to argue. They roam this desert expanse with a nonchalance that would make a turtle seem frantic. One minute they’re not there, the next, they’ve materialized like a desert mirage, complete with camels that look like they’ve swallowed a rather grumpy philosophy professor. I dare say, their tents are not exactly Buckingham Palace. More like a well-worn prayer rug stretched over some unfortunate sticks, but it does the job, I suppose, keeping out at least some of the sand, and the occasional overly enthusiastic sand viper looking for a bit of shade.

They’re a fiercely independent lot, these Bedouins, clinging to traditions older than Methuselah’s beard. They regard the modern world with a mixture of amusement and disdain, as if civilization is merely a passing fad that they fully expect to outlive. Their coffee, brewed in a pot blackened by countless fires, is strong enough to wake the dead and guaranteed to keep you jittery for a week, but politely refusing it is considered an insult roughly equivalent to suggesting their camel has halitosis. I saw one once, driving a Toyota pickup with a falcon perched on the dashboard. A sight that, I assure you, could induce a fit of philosophical contemplation in the most hardened observer. They’ll bargain with you until the sun sets, haggle over the price of a worn-out carpet like it’s the crown jewels, and then invite you to share their meager meal with the generosity of a king. Contradictory, perhaps, but endearingly so. The Bedouin, you see, is a walking paradox, a testament to the human spirit’s ability to not only survive but to thrive in the most unforgiving of landscapes, all while maintaining a healthy dose of suspicion for anyone wearing shoes more polished than a camel's hump.
