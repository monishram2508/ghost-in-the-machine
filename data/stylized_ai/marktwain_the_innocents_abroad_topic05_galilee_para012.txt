Now, Galilee. Ah, Galilee! They call it the Holy Land, and perhaps it is, depending on your definition of "holy." Certainly, it's full of holy dust, enough to choke a camel, or even a particularly pious tourist. The Sea of Galilee, they say, is where miracles happened. Well, I looked sharp, I did, and I saw nary a miracle, unless you count the miracle of fishermen still catching fish in a body of water that's been fished in since Noah launched his ark. It's a picturesque enough lake, mind you, all shimmering in the sun like a newly-minted dime, albeit a rather small dime compared to, say, Lake Michigan. Tiberias, the town on its shore, boasts ancient ruins, which is another way of saying piles of rocks that enterprising guides will claim were once the palace of Herod Antipas. Now, Herod, there's a fellow who knew how to throw a party, if the stories are to be believed. Though, judging by the ruins of his palace, he didn't prioritize good stonemasonry.

The land itself is fertile enough, I suppose. Olive groves stretch across the hills like wrinkles on an old man's face, and there's some grain and whatnot growing here and there. They till the soil with oxen, still, just like in the Bible stories, which is either wonderfully quaint or desperately backward, depending on your temperament. The people, bless their hearts, are a hardy lot, tanned and weathered by the sun and the hard work. They'll sell you souvenirs with a smile, and then charge you double if they think you’re from a country that makes more money than theirs. One must admire their entrepreneurial spirit, even if it stings the pocketbook a bit. All in all, Galilee is a pleasant enough place to visit, full of history, biblical significance, and enough holy sites to keep even the most dedicated pilgrim busy. Just be sure to bring a sturdy pair of shoes, a wide-brimmed hat, and a healthy dose of skepticism, because, let's be honest, a good dose of skepticism is a necessary ingredient in any proper journey, spiritual or otherwise. And do watch out for those entrepreneurial souvenir vendors, they are persistent.
