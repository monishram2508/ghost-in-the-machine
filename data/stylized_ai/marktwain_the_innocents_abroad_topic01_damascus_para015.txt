Damascus, ah, Damascus! They call it the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, and I reckon that’s about right. You can practically smell the history rising up from the dust, a pungent aroma not unlike a camel after a long desert trek. I spent a spell wandering its labyrinthine alleys, these souks, or "markets," as they call them, which are twisty and turny enough to make a politician seem straightforward. You'd think you were lost forever, surrounded by merchants hollering prices that are as inflated as a Frenchman's ego, each one swearing his silken scarf is the finest ever woven by human hand, and that your own grandfather probably bartered for inferior goods. The air itself hangs thick with the scent of spices, enough to knock a man senseless if he ain't careful. They’ve got frankincense potent enough to raise the dead, if the dead had a hankering for it, and enough brass and copper to build a battleship, although I can’t quite fathom what purpose a battleship would serve in a desert. 

And the people! A curious mix, indeed. They'll offer you a cup of coffee sweeter than a preacher's smile, then try to sell you a rug that's about as authentic as a politician's promise. One fellow, with a twinkle in his eye and a beard that reached his navel, insisted his sword was the very one Saladin used to chop up Crusaders. I had my doubts, of course, seeing as it looked suspiciously like it was forged last Tuesday by a blacksmith with a fondness for cheap metal. Still, one can't begrudge a man his storytelling, especially when it comes with the opportunity to sit in the shade and watch the world go by. A body could spend a lifetime unraveling the mysteries of Damascus, and I suspect he'd still only scratch the surface. But the very attempt would be an adventure, wouldn’t it? A glorious, dusty, thoroughly bewildering adventure. And heaven knows, a man can’t get enough of those before they nail the lid down on his coffin.
