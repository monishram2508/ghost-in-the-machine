Chamonix, you say? A village tucked away in the French Alps, like a forgotten franc in the pocket of a particularly disreputable mountain range. They call it the gateway to Mont Blanc, which, if you ask me, sounds awfully drafty. One imagines the poor mountain perpetually shivering in its eternal coat of snow. I ventured there, driven by the whisperings of tourists with more francs than sense, all babbling about breathtaking views and heart-stopping adventures. I’m here to tell you, breath was plentiful, and my heart, bless its steady little thump, remained stubbornly unstopped.

The village itself is a curious affair, a hodgepodge of quaint chalets and establishments that would gladly relieve you of your money in exchange for a thimbleful of something they call “vin chaud,” guaranteed to warm the very cockles of your soul, or at least, temporarily numb the awareness that you've just paid five euros for spiced wine that tastes suspiciously like Christmas potpourri. One finds oneself surrounded by individuals sporting enough Gore-Tex to outfit a polar expedition, all vying for space in the cable car leading to the Aiguille du Midi, a steel toothpick stuck precariously into the sky. I watched them, these brave souls, with a mixture of envy and profound disbelief. To dangle oneself at such a height, suspended only by a length of rather suspect-looking cable? I should think I’d rather sit by the fire, reading a good book and allowing my imagination to scale the peaks on my behalf. Much safer, and considerably cheaper, too, unless of course, the book in question is printed on gold leaf. And the views, well, they were undeniably...mountainous. A great deal of rock and snow, arranged in a manner pleasing, no doubt, to the geometrically inclined. But for myself, I preferred the view from the village, which included a bakery selling truly magnificent croissants. Now *that*, my friends, is a view worth braving the Alps for.
