The Neckar, bless its unassuming heart, ambles along through Swabia with a sort of contented sluggishness that reminds me of Adam on a particularly lazy Tuesday morning. It's not the Rhine, mind you, that boisterous, self-important fellow, flaunting its grandeur for all the world to see. No, the Neckar is more like a shy country cousin, content to meander past vineyards and half-timbered towns, whispering secrets to the weeping willows that droop their verdant tresses into its murky depths. Now, you might think a river that slow wouldn't have much to say, but you'd be wrong. It has stories aplenty, if you’re willing to listen close enough, stories whispered by the echoes of Roman legions who once fortified its banks and the gentle clinking of steins in Heidelberg’s student pubs.

And the castles! Ah, the castles perched upon the hills overlooking the Neckar! They stand like tipsy old noblemen, slightly worse for wear and a bit past their prime, but still radiating an undeniable air of importance. One can almost imagine them gossiping amongst themselves across the valley, tales of courtly intrigues and long-forgotten battles floating on the evening breeze. The river itself, of course, has seen it all. It's watched empires rise and fall, lovers meet and part, and doubtless, a fair number of unsuspecting souls tumble in after one too many glasses of that local Trollinger wine. One can’t help but chuckle at the thought. The Neckar, you see, is a patient river, a forgiving river, a river that understands the follies of humankind and simply keeps flowing, onward and onward, towards its eventual rendezvous with the mighty Rhine. Rather like Eve observing Adam, perhaps, with a mixture of exasperation and fondness.
