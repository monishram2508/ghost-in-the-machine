Heidelberg! A town that clings to the hillside like a lovesick ivy to an ancient ruin, and indeed, ruin aplenty there is. A castle, magnificent in its decay, presides over the scene, a monstrous, ruddy hulk that looks as if a giant, after a particularly riotous picnic, flung his leftover sandstone bricks about in a fit of pique. One half expects to see a tipsy Titan stagger out, demanding another stein of Rhenish. The town itself, huddled below, is a charming jumble of gabled roofs and crooked lanes, just precisely the sort of place where a man might lose himself, and happily so. The students, bless their romantic souls, roam about with the air of world-weary philosophers, discussing metaphysics, undoubtedly, though likely fuelled by more beer than brainpower. They carry their faces with such solemn seriousness, one cannot help but suspect they are each convinced they alone hold the key to unlocking the universe’s mysteries, a notion readily forgiven when one considers the distractions available in the local taverns. Ah, the taverns! Warm, smoky havens filled with the clatter of steins, the rumble of German conversation, and the faint aroma of pipe tobacco – a symphony of gemütlichkeit that could charm the hinges off a Prussian general. And the Neckar! A placid, winding river that seems to dawdle its way through the landscape as if uncertain whether to be a proper river or a leisurely canal. One can hire a boat and drift lazily along, contemplating the reflections of the castle in the water, and perhaps, just perhaps, forget all about the dreary business of being alive in the twenty-first century. Yes, Heidelberg possesses a certain…well, a certain something. An air of ancient romance, a whiff of bohemian revelry, and a healthy dose of comfortable disrepair. It is, in short, a place where a man can feel perfectly at home, even if he has no earthly business being there at all.
