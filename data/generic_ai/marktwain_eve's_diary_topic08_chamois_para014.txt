The chamois, a goat-antelope species native to the rugged mountains of Europe, stands as a testament to adaptation and resilience. These agile creatures, belonging to the genus *Rupicapra*, are renowned for their remarkable climbing abilities and surefootedness in precipitous terrain. Two distinct species are recognised: the Alpine chamois (*Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra*), found throughout the Alps and other mountain ranges of Central and Eastern Europe, and the Pyrenean chamois (*Rupicapra pyrenaica*), inhabiting the Pyrenees and Cantabrian Mountains of Spain and France. Chamois are characterised by their short, hooked horns, typically present in both sexes, and a distinctive black stripe running from the eye to the muzzle. Their coats undergo seasonal changes, transitioning from a reddish-brown in summer to a darker, thicker, almost black coat in winter, providing effective camouflage against the contrasting landscapes. They are relatively small ungulates, with adults typically weighing between 25 and 60 kilograms and standing around 70-85 centimetres tall at the shoulder.

Chamois are primarily diurnal herbivores, feeding on a variety of grasses, herbs, leaves, and buds, adjusting their diet to the available vegetation depending on the season and altitude. During the harsh winter months, when food is scarce, they may resort to consuming tougher vegetation, such as pine needles and bark. Social structure varies depending on the time of year; during the warmer months, females and their young form small herds, while males often remain solitary or form small bachelor groups. The mating season, known as the rut, occurs in late autumn and early winter, during which males engage in fierce competition for dominance and access to females. The gestation period lasts around six months, and typically a single kid is born in late spring or early summer. Chamois kids are precocial, capable of walking shortly after birth, and remain closely dependent on their mothers for several months. While they face threats from predators like wolves, lynx, and golden eagles, particularly affecting the young, the biggest challenge for chamois populations remains habitat loss and fragmentation, alongside human hunting activities, necessitating careful management and conservation efforts to ensure their long-term survival in the challenging mountainous environments they call home.
