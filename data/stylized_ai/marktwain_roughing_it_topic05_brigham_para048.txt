Now, Brigham, there’s a character ripe for a tale, fit to be boiled down in a kettle and sold as patent medicine. He was a man, that Brigham, or at least, he looked the part, though some whispered he was more akin to a finely oiled machine, built for purpose and lacking in the extraneous fluff one generally associates with the softer emotions. He’d a face carved from granite, the kind that wouldn't crack if you dropped it off the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and eyes that could bore a hole straight through a gold mine. They say he built a city out of dust and faith, which, mind you, sounds about as easy as milking a rattlesnake in a blizzard. 

He had this air about him, a kind of “don’t you dare question me, son” vibe that’d wither a dandelion at fifty paces. Folks flocked to him like moths to a kerosene lamp, drawn by the promise of salvation, or land, or maybe just the sheer audacity of the man. He was a master of the grand pronouncements, booming pronouncements that reverberated through the valleys and settled like dust on the consciences of the skeptical. He’d declare something to be the “manifest destiny,” and before you knew it, wagons were rolling, fields were being plowed, and another thousand souls were scratching out a life in the godforsaken wilderness.

And the wives! Good heavens, the wives! Enough to populate a small nation, I reckon. Some said it was for religious reasons, some said it was for political leverage, and some just said the man had a persuasive tongue. Whatever the reason, the man certainly kept busy. He left behind a legacy that's more tangled than a skein of wool after a cat's been at it, a legacy that’s still being unraveled and debated to this day. He was a king, a prophet, a tyrant, a visionary – depending on who you asked. One thing's for certain though, Brigham Young, he was one peculiar fish in this big, salty ocean of life. And peculiar fish, friend, are the ones that make the best stew.
