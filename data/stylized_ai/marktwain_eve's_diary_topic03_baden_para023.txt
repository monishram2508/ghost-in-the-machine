Baden, ah, Baden! A name that rolls off the tongue like a freshly buttered pretzel, and yet, the reality, dear Eve, is considerably less satisfying. One arrives expecting fountains that gush forth with champagne (a regrettable oversight, I find), and instead encounters water, plain water, though supposedly medicinal. They insist it possesses qualities to cure ailments I didn’t even know I had, ailments that seem to flourish only in the presence of so much enforced leisure. The place is overrun, of course, with those afflicted by a particular kind of wealth sickness; pallid ladies adorned in enough jewels to fund a small war, and gentlemen whose complexions suggest a diet consisting solely of brandy and boredom. They promenade along the Lichtentaler Allee, these pampered souls, their dogs as meticulously coiffed as their own heads, exchanging pleasantries so saccharine they could rot your teeth from ten paces. One hears snippets of conversations about the fluctuating price of diamonds, the scandalous behavior of so-and-so's daughter, and the relative merits of various Turkish bathhouses. 

The Kurhaus, naturally, is a monstrous edifice, all gilded plaster and echoing halls, where one can gamble away a fortune in a single, ill-advised turn of a card. I observed a particularly flamboyant gentleman, with a mustache that threatened to detach itself and fly away, lose what appeared to be the deed to his ancestral castle. He accepted the loss with a theatrical sigh and ordered another bottle of something expensive, proving that some wounds are best salved with vintage wine. The air hangs heavy with the scent of perfume, desperation, and the faint aroma of sulphur from those blessed, medicinal waters. I attempted a dip myself, hoping to acquire some hitherto undiscovered talent for whist, but only emerged smelling faintly of boiled eggs and disappointment. Still, one must experience Baden to truly understand the peculiar ennui of the privileged, and, perhaps, to appreciate the simple pleasures of a well-aimed apple and a good, old-fashioned Adam.
