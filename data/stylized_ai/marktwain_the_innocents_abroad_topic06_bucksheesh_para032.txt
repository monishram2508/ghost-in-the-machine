Now, about this bucksheesh, this universal lubricant of the Orient, this palm-greaser that works wonders where laws and logic fail. It's a thing that’ll plague your pockets and tickle your moral conscience, I warrant. You might start out all high and mighty, swearing you’ll not contribute to such a system of legalized bribery, that you’ll stand on principle and let the chips fall where they may. You’ll march right up to that official, puffing yourself up like a pouter pigeon, expecting him to be impressed by your righteous indignation. But mark my words, that same righteous indignation will wilt faster than a rose in the Sahara sun when you find your papers mysteriously "lost" or your camel inexplicably "lame".

You see, bucksheesh is not merely a transaction, it’s a conversation, a delicate dance between need and expediency. It’s a whisper in the marketplace, a glint in the eye of a gatekeeper, a certain… understanding, passed along with the coin. A fella might find himself delayed at a border crossing for an eternity, simply for lacking this particular vocabulary. One might be told the bridge is closed, or the road washed out, or perhaps even that the moon is made of green cheese and one must pay handsomely to be disabused of such a notion. Then, a small offering, slipped discreetly into the right hand, and suddenly, wouldn't you know it? The bridge is as sturdy as Gibraltar, the road dry as a bone, and the moon… well, the moon is still likely made of green cheese, but nobody's going to bother you about it now.

I recollect old man Hemlock, a missionary I knew out in Palestine, started out dead set against the practice. He wanted to spread the gospel of honest living, by gum! But after a year of his well-meaning efforts being continually thwarted by "unforeseen circumstances," he commenced to preachin’ the gospel with a bit o’ bucksheesh on the side. Said it greased the wheels, so to speak, and got the word of the Lord spread all the faster. Whether the Lord approves of such grease, I leave to theologians and snake-oil salesmen to argue over. All I know is, it makes life easier, and if that ain’t a kind of divine blessing in itself, I don’t know what is.
