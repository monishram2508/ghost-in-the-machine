Now, these miners, you see, were a breed apart, cut from the very same cloth as the bedrock they blasted through. Grimy, unshaven fellas, most of 'em, with eyes that held more grit than a gravel slide and hands tougher than a seasoned mule's hide. They’d come from every corner of the blasted earth, lured by whispers of bonanzas and veins thicker than a hog’s back – mostly whispers, mind you, for fortunes were scarcer than honest politicians. You’d find a Cornishman who could practically smell tin a mile off, a German who measured everything twice, a Frenchman who could cook a decent meal out of a badger and a handful of sagebrush, and a scattering of fellows from back East who hadn't the slightest notion what they were doing but were powerful optimistic all the same.

Their days were spent down in the guts of the mountains, where the sun was a rumor and the air thick enough to chew. They’d swing a pick like a man possessed, drill holes deeper than a preacher's sermon, and blast away at the rock with enough powder to send a small town sky-high. And for what? Maybe a pocket full of nuggets that wouldn’t fill a teacup, maybe nothing but dust and the lingering smell of sulfur. But they kept at it, bless their stubborn souls, driven by that fool's hope that flickered brighter than a miner’s lamp in the darkest tunnel. Evenings were spent around a campfire, fueled by pine and potent liquor. Tales were spun, taller than the Sierras themselves, of fortunes won and lost, of veins that ran to China, and of mythical creatures lurking in the dark corners of the mines – creatures that probably existed only in the bottom of a whiskey bottle, but entertaining nonetheless. They were a rough bunch, no doubt, prone to brawls and blasphemy, but underneath all the grime and bluster, they were honest folk, bound together by the shared hardship and the shared dream of striking it rich. A dream that, more often than not, turned out to be as elusive as a jackrabbit in a sandstorm.
