Now, the Colosseum, that grand old amphitheater of Rome, a place where, they say, gladiators fought tooth and nail, lions roared with a hunger that could curdle milk, and emperors, bless their self-important souls, gave thumbs up or down like they were ordering sausages. I reckon it's quite a sight, even after all these centuries of being nibbled on by time and souvenir-hunting tourists. Folks gawk at it like it’s a three-headed calf at a county fair, their eyes wide with a sort of bewildered reverence. Imagine, if you will, the blood that's been spilled on those sands! Enough to fill the Tiber, probably, though I wouldn't recommend swimming in it, not unless you have a peculiar fondness for rust and the faint echo of mortal screams.

They'll tell you it was built by the Flavians, which is a fancy way of saying some emperors with more power than sense decided they needed a bigger playground. And, well, bigger it is. You could fit half of St. Louis in that thing, and still have room for a brass band and a lemonade stand. The architecture, they say, is magnificent. And I suppose it is, if you're partial to arches and columns and the general look of "We're Romans, and we build things to last, even if they’re only meant for watching people get torn to pieces.” One can't help but wonder what the common Roman thought of it all, the average Joe who had to pay the taxes to keep the lions fed and the gladiators equipped with shiny swords. Likely, he grumbled, just like any taxpayer the world over, even then. Yet, he still went, of course, a morbid curiosity being a universal human trait, I suspect. To watch the spectacle, to shout his approval, to feel, for a moment, elevated above the mundane drudgery of his existence. Perhaps, in a way, it was all just a grand performance, a theatrical distraction from the inevitable, and the audience, then as now, ever eager to be entertained, even by the darkest of dramas.
