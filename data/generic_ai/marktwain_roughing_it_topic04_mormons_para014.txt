Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, emerged in the United States during the 19th century, founded by Joseph Smith. Smith claimed to have received a series of revelations, including the translation of the Book of Mormon from golden plates he discovered buried in upstate New York. This book, considered scripture alongside the Bible, narrates the story of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who migrated from Jerusalem and were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. The Church’s early history was marked by significant persecution and westward migration, driven by religious differences and social tensions. They eventually settled in the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah, under the leadership of Brigham Young, establishing a thriving community and a unique cultural identity.

Central to Mormon belief is the concept of a restored gospel, asserting that the fullness of Christian doctrine and priesthood authority had been lost over time and was now restored through Smith. They emphasize the importance of family, missionary work, temple worship, and adherence to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which encourages abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. Their theology includes the belief in continued revelation, meaning that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets today. This belief underpins their ongoing development of doctrine and practice, adapting to the changing needs and challenges of the modern world. While generally aligned with Christian principles, Mormon theology diverges from traditional Christianity in its views on the nature of God, the afterlife, and the role of humanity in achieving exaltation. Latter-day Saints believe in a premortal existence, the potential for humans to become like God, and a tiered afterlife with varying degrees of glory. The Church operates a global missionary program, sending young adults around the world to share their beliefs and engage in service, fostering a strong sense of community and international connection. Over time, the Church has become more integrated into mainstream society, participating in interfaith dialogue and community outreach programs while maintaining its distinct theological identity and cultural heritage.
