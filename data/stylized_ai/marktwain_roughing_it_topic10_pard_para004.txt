Now, pard, you likely ain't acquainted with a pard proper, unless you’ve been lost a spell in the Territories, scratchin' for gold and swappin' tall tales with fellas lookin' just as lost as yourself. A pard, you see, ain't just some fella you share a drink with at the saloon, though that’s a fair start. A pard's more like a second skin, only one that cusses more and shares less. He's the fella who'll pull you outta that crick when you’re knee-deep in quicksand and lookin' dumber than a stump, and then proceed to remind you 'bout it every blessed Tuesday for the next twenty years. He’s the one who'll argue with you 'til the cows come home about whether it's better to pan for gold upriver or downriver, even though he’s never actually found enough gold to fill a thimble either way.

And Lord knows, a pard ain’t always pretty. He might snore louder than a freight train, chew tobacco like a grasshopper in a hayfield, and smell vaguely of mule and campfire smoke. He might have opinions so contrary to your own that you wonder how you ever ended up on the same side of the Mississippi, let alone sharin' a tent. But dagnabbit, when the chips are down, and them claim jumpers are comin' round, he’s the first one to grab his rifle and stand beside you, even if he’s still grumbling 'bout that time you ate the last biscuit. He’ll split his meager earnings with you, even if it means eatin' beans for a month, and he’ll tell you the truth, even when it’s uglier than a mud fence. Because a pard, you see, ain’t just a convenience; he’s a burden, a comfort, and a constant, dad-blasted headache all rolled into one, and you wouldn’t trade him for all the gold in California. Just don’t go expectin' him to change his socks, or to admit you were right about the river situation. Some things, pard, are simply beyond the pale.
