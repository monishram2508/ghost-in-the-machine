Heidelberg, ah, Heidelberg! A town seemingly dreamt up by a confectioner with a penchant for the picturesque. One might think, upon first glimpse of its castle, perched precariously upon the hillside like a tipsy titan, that it was built entirely of gingerbread and sugared almonds. And bless my stars if the Neckar river, meandering lazily through the valley below, isn't the color of slightly diluted cocoa, though I wouldn't advise dipping a finger in it for a taste, mind you. It’s likely teeming with things best left unexamined. The students, a flock of them invariably congregating at every corner, seemed permanently attached to their steins, raising them with a gusto that suggested they were single-handedly holding up the entire German beer industry. They sing, they shout, they generally create a din that would make a cat flee for the Alps, but one cannot help but admire their sheer, unadulterated exuberance. Then there are the tourists, bless their innocent, shutterbug-addicted souls, perpetually snapping photographs of everything from the Great Vat (which, frankly, is just a ridiculously oversized barrel) to the Bratwurst vendors, who look as though they've been perpetually grilling sausages since the time of Charlemagne. I watched one fellow nearly trip over a cobblestone while attempting to capture the perfect angle of a half-timbered house. He recovered admirably, however, and resumed his artistic endeavours with renewed vigor, proving that even the most perilous quest for the perfect photo cannot deter the determined tourist. The entire town, one feels, exists solely for the purpose of being admired, sketched, painted, and, of course, photographed into oblivion. It’s a theatrical production in stone and mortar, and one simply cannot help but applaud its unwavering commitment to charm, even if it is a charm that is a touch, shall we say, aggressively applied.
