The Neckar, bless its meandering soul, is a river of considerable local renown, though I suspect the Mississippi wouldn't lose a wink of sleep over it. It snakes through Württemberg like a tipsy seamstress’s thread, occasionally pausing to admire its reflection, or perhaps to catch its breath after a particularly strenuous bend. Now, some folks will tell you it’s a romantic river, all castles perched on precipices and vineyards clinging to the slopes like barnacles on a hull. And I won’t deny the scenery is pretty enough, though "romantic" feels a bit strong. I reckon a cow in a pasture is also rather picturesque, but one doesn't go about penning sonnets to its cud-chewing prowess. The barges that ply the Neckar are about as romantic as a load of gravel, which, come to think of it, is probably what they’re usually carrying. Still, they have a certain ponderous charm, especially when you imagine the captain bellowing orders in a voice that could curdle milk three counties over.

And the towns along the Neckar! Heidelberg, of course, thinks highly of itself, what with its university and its ruin of a castle looking down its nose at everyone. Tübingen’s no better, all self-important with its theologians and students whispering scandalous philosophies in the cobblestone alleys. They both seem to believe they're the very navels of the universe, when, in reality, they're just a few more brick-and-mortar settlements pretending to be something grander. I’ve seen chickens with more humility. But I suppose that's the charm of these little German towns; they have a way of taking themselves extraordinarily seriously, which, from a distance, is rather droll. Just don't expect me to drink their wine or admire their stained glass windows with undue enthusiasm. I'm more interested in the fellow on the bridge fishing, probably for something not worth the trouble, but doing it with such dedicated concentration, you'd think he was angling for the meaning of life. Now, that's something worth pondering on a lazy afternoon by the Neckar, with or without the romance.
