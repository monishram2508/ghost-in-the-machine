Now, these Mormons, they're a sight to behold, a regular human menagerie gathered in the desolate valleys of Utah. You’d think the desert would discourage any sensible soul, but not these folks. They flock there like buzzards to a carcass, only instead of carrion, they're after salvation, or at least, whatever Brigham Young was sellin’ that day. A fella can’t hardly throw a rock in Salt Lake City without hitting a church steeple or a polygamist’s domicile, though discerning which is which sometimes requires a surveyor's eye and a good deal of guesswork. They’re industrious, I’ll give them that. They’ve turned the barren wasteland into a blooming, irrigated garden, though I suspect the grass is always greener when it's watered with the sweat of multiple wives.

They got this religion cooked up so fine, it would make even the devil think twice about his own fiery doctrines. They talk of golden plates and angelic visitations, and a whole bunch of goings-on that would make your average Methodist deacon raise a skeptical eyebrow. But you gotta admire the sheer audacity of it all. They got a system worked out, where everybody pulls their weight, and nobody starves, least not unless Brigham says so. And let me tell you, Brigham was a fella who could stare down a grizzly bear and then sell it life insurance. Smart as a whip, and twice as dangerous.

Their womenfolk, now, they're a hardy breed. Some of them, anyway. The first wives always seem to have a certain…gravitas. The later editions often look like they've been caught in a perpetual whirlwind of laundry, children, and the simmering resentment of sharing a husband. Still, they smile and wave, ever so politely, while you try to remember which wife is hitched to which son of which brother. It’s a family affair, alright, and a complicated one at that. All in all, these Mormons, they're an oddity. A fascinating, perplexing, and occasionally irritating blot on the American landscape. But you got to admit, they do know how to build a city and defend a dogma, which is more than most folks can say.
