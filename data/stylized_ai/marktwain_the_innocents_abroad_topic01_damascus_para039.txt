Damascus, ah, a city of such antiquity it makes Methuselah look a spring chicken, a place where history drips from the very stones like overripe apricots in August. I tell you, it's so old they probably used it to sharpen cavemen's clubs. One walks through the souks, and one is fairly assaulted by the scent of spices, perfumes that could raise Cleopatra herself from the dead just to haggle over the price of saffron. The merchants, bless their souls, are keen as a tack and sharper than a Damascus blade itself – which, speaking of, are unfortunately no longer quite what they used to be. I suspect the secret was lost when some careless apprentice used the wrong recipe for his morning coffee, a tragic tale indeed. Though they still peddle them, you see, claiming each one could slice a falling feather in two, but I wager they'd struggle with a particularly stubborn stick of licorice these days. The houses! – clinging together like gossiping old women, each with its own little courtyard, a green oasis where one could imagine scheming sultans and dancing dervishes of bygone eras. Mind you, these oases are often populated by stray cats, who are undeniably ancient themselves, and seem to hold a distinct air of superiority, as if they personally witnessed the building of the city walls. And the sounds! The call to prayer echoing from a thousand minarets, a glorious, somewhat mournful symphony that could make a heathen consider a quick conversion. It is, in short, a glorious mess, a beautiful chaos, a city that wears its age like a badge of honor, a sprawling, dusty museum where the artifacts occasionally try to sell you a carpet. One might find cleaner, more orderly cities in the world, but I daresay one would be hard pressed to find one with such a wonderfully cluttered soul. Why, even the air itself feels thick with stories, whispers from the past that tickle the ear and make one wonder if that beggar is truly destitute, or merely an incognito Caliph testing your generosity. You see, Damascus is a city that makes one think, and thinking, as we all know, is a dangerous occupation, particularly when one is surrounded by so much temptation to simply sit and sip strong coffee.
