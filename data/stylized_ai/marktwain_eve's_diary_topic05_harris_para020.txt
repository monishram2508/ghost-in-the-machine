Harris, bless his heart, he’s one of those fellas you just can’t help but observe with a peculiar mixture of fascination and mild trepidation. He's like a newly invented contraption, all gears and levers and sputtering noises, and you're never quite sure if it's going to churn out something useful or simply explode. He possesses an earnestness that borders on the theatrical, as if he's forever auditioning for the role of 'Most Upright Citizen' in a play nobody else is aware of. Why, just yesterday, I watched him attempt to assist Mrs. Higginbotham with her overflowing grocery bags. It was a sight to behold, that. He tripped not once, but twice, sending oranges rolling down Main Street like escaped cannonballs, and somehow managed to get his hat tangled in the leash of her miniature poodle, Fifi, creating a chaotic tableau that would have made Rubens himself weep with delight.

And his pronouncements! He spouts them forth like he’s just swallowed a dictionary and is now regurgitating random definitions. He'll declare, with the utmost conviction, that "punctuality is the lynchpin of societal cohesion," then promptly arrive an hour late for a meeting, citing an unforeseen encounter with a particularly loquacious squirrel. He's got this unwavering belief in the power of reason, though I suspect his reasoning faculty is more like a rusty weather vane, constantly swinging according to the latest breeze of opinion. He is a walking contradiction, a paradox wrapped in tweed, a man who manages to be both infuriating and endearing simultaneously. He has the best intentions, I truly believe, but he applies them with the precision of a blacksmith attempting brain surgery. One might argue he’s a simpleton, but I disagree. He's far too complicated to be simple. No, Harris, he's something… else. A natural wonder, perhaps, like a geyser that occasionally erupts with pronouncements about the moral imperative of flossing. He is Harris. And God help us all.
