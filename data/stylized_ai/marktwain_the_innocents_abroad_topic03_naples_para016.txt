Naples, ah, Naples! A city so vigorously alive, it practically vibrates in your very teeth. They call it a city, mind you, but it’s more like a colossal, chaotic carnival masquerading as one. Stepping off the steamer was akin to being swallowed whole by a painted dragon, belching forth smoke, music, and a general air of amiable pandemonium. The streets, bless their cobblestoned souls, are not so much thoroughfares as they are organically grown mazes, each alleyway a gamble leading either to a sun-drenched piazza or a dead-end overflowing with what I charitably assume was once edible.

The Neapolitans themselves are a breed apart, possessed of a vivacity that puts a hummingbird to shame. They gesticulate with the fervor of operatic conductors, their voices rising and falling in a symphony of bargaining and boisterous greetings. One fellow, hawking what he claimed was a genuine Roman artifact (it resembled nothing so much as a particularly lumpy potato), nearly dislocated my arm in his enthusiastic attempt to secure my patronage. I confess, I nearly bought the wretched thing, simply to escape his persuasive grip.

And the noise! Good heavens, the noise! It's a constant, cacophonous chorus of sputtering engines, honking horns, and the aforementioned operatic voices, all competing for auditory supremacy. Yet, somehow, within this seeming bedlam, there is a rhythm, a pulse that quickens your own. One observes that a fellow can haggle for a loaf of bread, receive the news from the far corners of the world, learn the names of his neighbor's fifteen children, and engage in a heated political debate, all before a decent American breakfast. A man could spend a lifetime in Naples, and still only scratch the surface of its teeming, turbulent heart. It's a city where the past clings to the present like a stubborn barnacle, a city of saints and sinners, of beauty and squalor, and a city that, despite its many imperfections, manages to captivate the soul with its utterly unrepentant charm. One may depart Naples, but Naples, I suspect, will never quite depart from you.
