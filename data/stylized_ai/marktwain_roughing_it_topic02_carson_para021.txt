Carson City, you say? Well, now, there's a spot. A man could spend a lifetime there and still not quite figure out if it's comin' or goin'. Claimed to be a city, mind you, with a grand capitol building smack in the middle, lookin' for all the world like a misplaced Greek temple that wandered off from some philosopher's garden and got stranded in the sagebrush. But step outside them hallowed halls of legislation, and you're liable to stumble over a tumbleweed bigger than your hat. They call it the capital of Nevada, which is a bit like claimin' a one-legged coyote is the king of the pack. Lots of dust, that's for certain. Dust that gets in your teeth, dust that gets in your eyes, dust that probably votes in the local elections, for all I know.

I tell you, the townsfolk are a curious breed themselves. A blend of prospectors who couldn’t find gold if it was glued to their boots, politicians lookin’ to feather their nests, and enough lawyers to strangle a buffalo herd. They shuffle around with a determined air, convinced they’re on the verge of striking it rich or passin’ some law that'll make 'em famous. Meanwhile, the only thing struck with any regularity is the local brewery, which does a brisk trade in compensatin' for dashed hopes and tedious debates. I saw one fellow there, name of Silas, I believe, swearin' up and down that he was just about to invent a self-milking cow. Been sayin' that for ten years, last I heard. The cow, I reckon, is still waiting. You might find more excitement watchin' paint dry, or perhaps attendin' a theological debate between two jackrabbits. But, bless their hearts, they call it home. And a body has to admire that kind of loyalty, even if it’s misplaced. All the same, I'd sooner bet on a frog jumpin' backwards than see Carson City turn into a metropolis. Though, I'll admit, it has a certain charm. The kind of charm you find in a rusty horseshoe or a dog with three legs. You might not want it, but you can't help but kinda like it.
