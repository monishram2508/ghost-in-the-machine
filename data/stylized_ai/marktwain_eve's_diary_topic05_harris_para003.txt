Harris, now there was a fellow built for confounding expectations. He fancied himself a connoisseur of all things artistic and refined, a veritable Medici in trousers, though his taste ran more towards the sort of art one might find on a cigar box than in the Louvre. He’d pronounce on the subtleties of a landscape like Constable, whilst simultaneously sporting a necktie that could curdle milk at fifty paces. He was a study in contrasts, a walking, talking oxymoron wrapped in tweed.

I remember one particular outing where Harris, armed with a sketching pad and an air of profound importance, decided to immortalize the tranquility of a particularly picturesque meadow. He set up his easel with the solemnity of a surgeon preparing for an operation, humming a vaguely familiar tune which, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a mangled rendition of "Pop Goes the Weasel." He squinted at the scene before him, puffing out his cheeks and making little “tsk” noises that suggested the landscape was not quite up to snuff, falling short of his exacting artistic vision. After an hour of furious scribbling, punctuated by the occasional dramatic sigh, he presented his masterpiece. It was, to put it kindly, an abstraction. A collection of squiggles and blotches that, with a considerable amount of imagination, one might construe as a cow. Or perhaps a small, angry cloud. The truly remarkable thing was Harris's unwavering conviction that he had captured the very essence of the meadow. He held the sketch aloft, his eyes gleaming with artistic fervor, and declared, “Observe, my friends, the ethereal light dancing on the verdant canvas!” I, naturally, nodded sagely, pretending to see the ethereal light, lest I incur the wrath of the artist. Harris, you see, was a man who mistook enthusiasm for talent, and volume for wisdom. And yet, despite it all, despite his utter lack of artistic aptitude, and despite his unwavering conviction in his own genius, one couldn’t help but feel a certain affection for the fellow. He was, after all, gloriously, hilariously, and utterly Harris.
