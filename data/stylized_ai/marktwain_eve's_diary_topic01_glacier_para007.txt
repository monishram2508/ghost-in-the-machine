Well, I declare, if there ain't something peculiar about these glaciers! Here I was, trekking across this frozen wilderness, thinking I was headed for a nice, quiet picnic, and what do I find? A river of ice, but one that moves slower than a Mississippi steamboat stuck in mud in August. It's a sight, I tell you, a ponderous, blue-ish white monstrosity, like a giant, grumpy cat that’s been sleeping for ages and only half awake. And people claim this thing is *alive*? Now, I've seen livelier pickles, I have. Though, I’ll grant you, it does possess a certain ambition, grinding and carving its way through mountains with the patience of a widow crocheting a quilt. 

The professor fellow I'm traveling with insists it's all due to the relentless pressure and the eternal struggle against gravity. Says each little snowflake, after years of being squashed under its brethren, decides to join the collective grudge and just…flow. Flow, mind you, like molasses uphill. He calls it 'glacial creep,' which sounds to me like an affliction best cured with a good dose of sunshine and a strong lemonade. But, no, this ain't some momentary discomfort; it's a slow, inexorable journey, leaving behind a trail of pulverized rock and bewildered pebbles as evidence of its passage. It also sheds debris like a mangy dog shedding hair; rocks, sticks, and all manner of geological flotsam clinging to its surface like barnacles on a lazy tugboat. And the sound! A low, groaning rumble, like the earth is having indigestion after a rather heavy meal of granite. You almost expect it to belch. I suppose it is quite a magnificent thing in its own way, a powerful testament to the slow, steady workings of nature. But for my money, I still prefer a good old-fashioned river – at least it has the good grace to *look* like it's going somewhere. This glacier? It appears to be in no particular hurry, and frankly, neither am I.
