Slade, now there's a name that conjures up images more fit for a penny dreadful than a proper settlement. Call it a town? Well, I've seen better towns fashioned out of tumbleweeds and jackrabbit bones. Situated there smack-dab in the middle of the desert like a flea on a dog's back, it held a certain desolation that was fascinating. The buildings were all built as if the carpenter was suddenly stricken with a terrible stomach cramp halfway through each task. They leaned as if in deep thought, or maybe just exhausted from facing the relentless sun. The saloon, of course, was the heart of the place, pumping out more stale beer and dubious tales than any healthy organ rightly ought to. I watched a fellow swear he'd seen a mountain lion wearing a sombrero ride into town, only to be met with nods and sips as though it were more common than a dust devil.

The folks inhabiting Slade were a curious blend themselves. A prospector with more beard than teeth seemed permanently attached to the corner booth, mumbling about a silver vein only he knew of, which, if true, begged the question of why he was still buying rotgut instead of yachts. A woman, I reckon a retired dance-hall performer, sat by the piano every evening, attempting to recall some old tune, though never quite succeeding, bless her persistent heart. They all appeared as weather-beaten and worn as the landscape around them, each face a roadmap of hard luck and sun-baked hope. Still, they were a friendly sort, even if their hospitality involved sharing whiskey that could likely double as paint thinner. Spending time in Slade was like watching a slow-motion train wreck – you couldn't quite look away, even if you knew nothing beautiful was coming. It was a place where reality and folklore blurred like heat waves on the horizon, and where a man could easily lose his sense of time, his money, or perhaps, even his mind. Now, I don’t regret my time spent there, but I won’t be rushing back to witness the next act of the Slade show.
