Higbie, now there was a specimen worthy of Barnum’s collection, though I reckon even Barnum might’ve scratched his head a bit before knowing where to put him. He was a man built like a saguaro cactus, all angles and stubborn, with a voice like gravel gargling in a tin can. He'd struck it rich at the 'Hale and Norcross' with that darn silver, or so he claimed, though if you asked me, luck found him blindfolded and tripped right into his grubby hands. He'd swagger about, puffing on a cigar the size of a baby's arm, declaring himself a pillar of the community. Pillar, indeed! More like a leaning, dilapidated shack. 

He’d hold forth in the saloon, spinning yarns so tall they’d snag on the church steeple. Each tale involved him outsmarting claim jumpers, fighting off grizzly bears with nothing but a toothpick, or discovering a vein of silver so pure it could blind a man at fifty paces. Naturally, the drinks were on him – or rather, on the unsuspecting tender who hadn't yet caught on to Higbie’s peculiar habit of "forgetting" his money pouch. He'd wink and say, “Pay you back double tomorrow, son,” a promise as solid as quicksand. The funny thing was, nobody really minded. Higbie, for all his bluster and tall tales, possessed a certain…well, let's call it *charm*. A charm akin to a persistent mosquito, irritating, but ultimately harmless. And truth be told, his stories provided a certain… entertainment, it was better than staring at the empty walls of a shack. He was the kind of man who could argue black was white and convince you to paint your house accordingly, all with a perfectly straight face and a twinkle in his rheumy eye. Higbie: a necessary evil, a walking paradox, and a testament to the fact that in the Wild West, even the biggest scoundrels could somehow earn their place in the tapestry of this madcap, glorious land. He was the kind of man I'd gladly share a bottle of whiskey with, even if I kept one hand firmly on my wallet.
