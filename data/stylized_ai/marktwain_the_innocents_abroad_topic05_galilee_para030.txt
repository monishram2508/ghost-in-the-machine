Galilee, they call it. A right pleasant little region, all told, though you’d hardly credit the fuss they kick up about it in the holy books. Now, I’ve seen sights from the Mississippi to the Black Sea, and I can tell you, Galilee ain't exactly bursting at the seams with marvels. It's got its hills, amiable enough I suppose, and a lake, the Sea of Galilee, which, mark you, is more of a pond than a sea, unless you're measuring by biblical hyperbole. It's a blue sort of puddle, ringed with the usual collection of beggars, boatmen keen to relieve you of your coin, and pilgrims with faces so long, you’d think they'd swallowed a fishing pole whole.

And the towns! Capernaum, Tiberias – names that roll off the tongue like honeyed scripture, but in reality, they're dusty, drowsy little villages where the donkeys outnumber the learned men ten to one. Tiberias has the saving grace of some hot springs, where you can boil yourself like a lobster in water that smells faintly of sulphur, if that strikes your fancy. Mind you, the locals will tell you it cures everything from a hangnail to the heartbreak of a rejected camel, so perhaps there's something to it, beyond the scalding.

They claim Jesus himself spent a goodly amount of time moseying about these parts, preaching and performing wonders. Can’t say I saw any miracles myself, apart from the miracle of a shopkeeper managing to extract five times the value of a particularly ugly clay pot from a gullible tourist. I suppose that’s a kind of miracle in its own right, a testament to human ingenuity, or perhaps just human cupidity. But all joking aside, Galilee does have a certain sleepy charm about it, a quiet simplicity that's a welcome respite from the hurly-burly of the rest of the world. Just don’t go expecting to find streets paved with gold, or angels singing in every olive grove, because you'll be sadly disappointed. It's just Galilee, after all, a somewhat sleepy and mildly diverting corner of creation, blessed, or perhaps burdened, by a reputation far exceeding its actual stature.
