The chamois, you see, is a creature that fancies the mountainous regions of Europe, and I use the word "fancies" with a pinch of salt, for I doubt they care a fig for fashion or the latest parlor games. No, these beasts prefer scrambling up impossibly steep slopes, where a sane individual would be clinging for dear life, not bounding along as if it were level ground. They're built, I reckon, like goats crossed with a particularly athletic spring, all lean muscle and an air of perpetual motion. And their horns, bless their hearts, curve back like a frustrated question mark, as if perpetually asking, "Are you sure you want to follow me up here?"

They’re surprisingly social creatures, these chamois, though one wonders what they find to gossip about. Perhaps they swap tales of near-death experiences on the precipice, or critique the grooming habits of the ibex. One imagines their conversations are rather economical, filled with grunts and knowing nods, for wasting precious breath seems an unwise tactic when one is already perched halfway to heaven. And oh, their coats! A rather drab, earthy hue, but one suspects they haven't the slightest interest in making a splash in the fashion world. Practicality, you see, is the order of the day. Besides, who would they be trying to impress, the eagles?

I once observed a group of them from a distance, through a borrowed spyglass. They looked for all the world like a collection of misplaced, brown-clad mountaineers, except without the good sense to carry ropes or the inclination to complain. The young ones, bless their reckless little hearts, chased each other with an abandon that made my own knees ache just to watch. And the older ones, seemingly weary of such frivolity, chewed their cud with a serene indifference, as if to say, "Been there, done that, nearly fallen off the cliff, got the t-shirt." Truly, a remarkable beast, the chamois, a testament to the enduring power of practicality and a complete disregard for the opinions of flatter, more sensible creatures.
