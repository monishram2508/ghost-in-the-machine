Well, now, here's a place for a body to stretch his legs and maybe contemplate the Almighty’s handiwork, assuming He had a hand in it and wasn't just off somewhere else tinkering with stars when Switzerland popped up. Lucerne it is, a town draped around a lake like a well-worn shawl on a portly matron. The mountains, bless their stony hearts, are ever present, poking their heads above everything like gossiping neighbors trying to get a peek at the goings-on. They're impressive, sure, but a bit predictable, wouldn't you say? Always standing there, looming, being majestic. Give me a good Mississippi mud flat any day for sheer novelty.

And the tourists! Why, they flock to this place like pigeons to a dropped crust of bread. Armed with cameras and sensible shoes, they march in orderly platoons, determined to "experience" Lucerne. They’ll point and gasp at the Chapel Bridge, a charmingly dilapidated wooden affair that, if truth be told, leans a bit more than a seasoned drunkard after a whiskey tasting. They’ll coo over the Lion Monument, that mournful chap carved into the rock. Makes you wonder if he's sad because he's stuck in a hillside or because he's had to listen to a thousand tourists butcher the pronunciation of "Löwendenkmal." I confess, I added to the chorus.

The shops are full of watches, knives, and chocolates, naturally. One might think the Swiss economy runs solely on the export of things that tell time, cut things, and provide instant gratification. It’s a clever system, I’ll grant them that. Keep the world on schedule, armed, and hopped up on sugar. A fella could make a fortune selling common sense to these tourists, but I suspect they’d rather spend their money on another cuckoo clock. And Lord knows, the prices! You could buy a small farm back in Missouri for the price of a cup of coffee and a stale croissant. Still, it's a pretty picture, Lucerne. A picture you pay dearly for, mind you, but a pretty one nonetheless.
