Now, a sepulchre, you see, is just a fancy word for a tomb, a glorified hole in the ground, but one with aspirations, mind you. Not the common, garden-variety grave dug out back by Uncle Jebediah after a particularly unfortunate hunting accident (involving, let's say, a startled skunk and a double-barreled shotgun – a tale for another time, that is). No, a sepulchre is the kind of resting place that’d make a pharaoh blush. We're talking marble, granite, possibly even a bit of imported Carrara if the deceased was feeling particularly pretentious in life. Think of it as a real estate venture for the dead, a final, immovable investment in prestige. I reckon the real estate agents in that spectral realm must be laughing all the way to the ethereal bank.

Of course, there’s the architectural aspect to consider. Some sepulchres are squat and purposeful, like a stubborn mule refusing to budge, while others reach for the heavens with pointy spires and enough ornamentation to bedazzle a whole flock of angels. I once saw one that featured a life-sized statue of the deceased, perched right on top, wearing what appeared to be his favorite fishing hat. Now, I have nothing against fishing, mind you, but it struck me as a bit... forward, shall we say? After all, eternity is a long time to spend in a damp hat. And the pigeons, well, let’s just say the statue wasn’t exactly improving the neighborhood's overall sanitation. One has to wonder if the fella was aware, while he was still kickin', that he'd someday be providing a sheltered perch for a whole covey of birds. Though I'm willing to bet if he was he would have been real pleased that he was able to help the local wildlife, even in death. Perhaps that's why he was wearing the hat to begin with. Then again, that seems like a bit too much charity for me, but who knows?
