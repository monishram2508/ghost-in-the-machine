Now, a sepulchre, as I understand it, ain't just your common, everyday hole in the ground with a pine box tossed in. Oh no, sir, a sepulchre is a statement. It's the grand finale, the ultimate curtain call, the final, resounding "Ta-da!" of a life, or at least, of a fortune left behind. You see 'em scattered about, these magnificent mausoleums, tryin' their darndest to outshine the Joneses even in death. There's the marble kind, gleamin' white like a politician's smile, probably just as phony underneath. And then there's the granite fellows, tough as a Missouri mule, lookin' like they'll outlast the pyramids, which, mind you, is sayin' somethin'. Inside, you'll likely find enough room to host a decent picnic, maybe even a small square dance if the deceased was inclined to lively company, though I reckon they'd be pretty quiet partners by then.

The inscriptions are a hoot, too. "Beloved husband," "Devoted mother," always glossin' over the little spats and squabbles that likely defined the relationship for half their mortal lives. You'd think, judging by the flowery language, they were saints instead of just regular folks who happened to breathe their last. And the statues! Angels weepin' into eternity, Greek gods lookin' bored out of their marble skulls, and the occasional likeness of the deceased, probably lookin' ten years younger and twenty pounds lighter than they ever did when they were breathin'. It's all a grand performance, see? Trying to convince the world, and maybe even the Almighty Himself, that the fella lyin' inside was somethin' special, somethin' worth rememberin'. Me, I figure a good headstone with the truth etched on it is enough. "Here lies Jedediah. He told a few tall tales and always paid his debts (mostly)." That'll do. Save the marble for folks who actually earned it, which, if you ask me, is a mighty short list. Besides, I'd rather be remembered for a good joke than a fancy tomb. A joke lasts longer, anyway.
