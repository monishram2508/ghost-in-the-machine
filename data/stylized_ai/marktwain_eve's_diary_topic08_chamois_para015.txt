Now, about these chamois, these mountain goats, if you will, or at least something pretending to be, up there prancing about on those Swiss Alps. One can’t help but observe their apparent disregard for gravity, a flouting of the laws of physics that would surely scandalize Sir Isaac Newton himself. They leap from crag to crag with an ease that suggests they’ve made a pact with some mischievous mountain spirit, or perhaps simply haven't bothered to read the relevant chapters in the book of "Staying Put on Solid Ground." Their coats, that lovely, almost butterscotch hue, are no doubt useful for camouflage against the rocks and the dried grasses. Useful, that is, until some fellow with a feather in his hat and a rifle in his hand comes along. Then, I suppose, the coat becomes less a cloak of invisibility and more a target. 

And the horns! Curled backward like some disgruntled comma in the grand sentence of nature, they seem almost comically impractical. One wonders if they ever accidentally hook them on low-hanging branches, or, worse yet, trip over them. Imagine the indignity! Though I suppose that's the curse of beauty, ain't it? The same thing goes for the tail, a stubby, comical appendage that reminds one of a well-worn paintbrush. It must be utterly useless in signaling anything of importance, unless, of course, the meaning is "I am a chamois, and I find myself rather short on tail." I'd like to think that their brain is smaller than a walnut, but I’d wager it is bigger than the average politician's heart, so at least they have that going for them. All in all, a perfectly delightful creature, if you don't mind the altitude sickness and the occasional rockslide they may inadvertently trigger. They have the good sense to live where it is beautiful, a concept lost on many.
