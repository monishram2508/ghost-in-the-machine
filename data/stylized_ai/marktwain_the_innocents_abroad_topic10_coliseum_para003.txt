Now, the Coliseum, that grand old ruin they call it. A ruin, mind you, after a spot of bother involving earthquakes and barbarians, and time itself turning its relentless grin toward the stones. You stroll inside, pay your shilling or two – highway robbery, naturally, but you wouldn't want to miss the pigeons roosting in the Imperial boxes, would you? – and try to picture the goings-on of yesteryear. They tell you gladiators fought there, great hulking brutes hacking at each other until one or the other was properly deceased. Makes you wonder if they had a good union back then, or if it was just a matter of "die today or die tomorrow" for those poor blighters. And lions, they say lions were involved. Always with the lions, these Romans. Likely borrowed them from some poor, unsuspecting African king with a promise of "eternal friendship" and then promptly tossed them into the arena to have a go at some chap in a skirt and sandals.

The whole thing is, of course, a bit of a circus, even now. Tourists gawking, guides spouting nonsense gleaned from poorly researched pamphlets, and trinket salesmen hawking miniature gladiators crafted from dubious metals. One almost expects to see P.T. Barnum himself pop out from behind a fallen column, offering to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge and a lifetime supply of Roman nose putty. But despite the modern circus that surrounds it, and the sheer indignity of having pigeons leave their calling cards on the Emperors' thrones, there’s a certain undeniable heft to the place. You can almost hear the roar of the crowd, imagine the sand stained crimson, and feel the weight of all those lives lived and lost in that vast, echoing bowl. It’s a dreadful, magnificent, appalling, awe-inspiring pile of rubble, and anyone who skips seeing it while in Rome probably prefers looking at paint dry, or counting blades of grass, which, I suppose, is their business, but still, a terrible waste of a good afternoon, if you ask me.
