Damascus, they call it the “Pearl of the Orient,” though I've seen pearls in oysters that possessed more life, mind you. Seems to me "Pearl of the Occasionally Irritable" would be a more accurate description, for there’s a persistent grumbling in the air, like a dyspeptic camel chewing on thistles. It's a city old enough to have witnessed the invention of conversation, and judging by the amount of arguing I’ve heard, they're still figuring out the rules. Why, Methuselah himself probably bought a rug here, haggling with a persistence that would make a badger blush. And speaking of rugs, you can't swing a cat (though I advise against it, they're rather fond of their felines here) without hitting a carpet weaver offering you "the finest Persian, guaranteed!" – which, of course, means it was likely woven by a Turk on a Tuesday.

The streets are a delightful chaos, a ballet of donkeys, merchants, and veiled women, all somehow managing to avoid fatal collisions, mostly. I did see a man nearly flattened by a water buffalo, but he simply dusted himself off, cursed a bit in Arabic (sounded like he was ordering a rather spicy dish), and went on his way. That's Damascus for you – life throws a water buffalo at your feet, you make lemonade (or, perhaps, strong coffee) and carry on. The air hangs thick with the smell of spices, jasmine, and something vaguely resembling burnt almonds, which I suspect is the city's attempt at aromatherapy. The food, bless its heart, is abundant and bewildering. You can get a stuffed grape leaf that's been passed down through generations of cooks, or a mystery meat skewer that could be anything from lamb to last week's pigeon. Eat first, ask questions later is my motto. You're bound to discover something unexpectedly delightful, or at least acquire a good story to tell – assuming your stomach survives the telling. All in all, Damascus is a city of contradictions, a place where ancient history collides with modern hustle, a dusty, delightful, occasionally exasperating, and utterly unforgettable experience.
