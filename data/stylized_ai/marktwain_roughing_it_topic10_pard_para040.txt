Now, pard, about this pard business, it's a queer fish altogether, ain't it? Sort of like tryin' to lasso a greased pig on a Sunday afternoon. See, a fella might be swingin' from the gallows one minute, all set to meet his maker, and the next, he’s whistlin’ a tune and struttin’ down the street like he owns the place, all thanks to some scribbled words on a fancy piece of paper. It's a miracle, I tell ya, right up there with findin’ a gold nugget the size of your fist. Of course, the folks who got wronged by that fella, they ain't seein' no miracles. They’re seein’ red, same color as the devil's britches, and they're howlin’ louder than a coyote caught in a trap. And you can’t blame ‘em, can ya? Justice is supposed to be blind, not nearsighted and wearin’ earplugs, pickin’ and choosing who gets a smack on the wrist and who gets the full dose of Judge Lynch's medicine.

Then you got the politicians mixed up in it, bless their cotton socks. They’re handin' out pardons like they’re givin' away stale gingerbread at a county fair. Each one's a political play, a backroom deal slicker than a snake oil salesman's pitch. You see a fella with the right connections, the kind that can fill a campaign chest faster than a busted dam fills a creek, well, he's practically got a get-out-of-jail-free card printed right on his forehead. And the poor sap who stole a loaf of bread to feed his family? He’s still breakin’ rocks, wishin' he'd had a friend in high places. It all makes a body wonder if Lady Justice ain't got one eye on the scales and the other on the voting booth. It’s a muddle, that’s what it is, a downright tangled-up muddle, enough to make a saint cuss and a sinner pray. So, next time you hear tell of a pardon, pard, just remember it ain't always sunshine and roses. Sometimes, it's just another shade of gray in a world that's already wearin' a perpetual coat of dust.
