Now, these Mormons, mind you, are a peculiar bunch, like a jackrabbit wearing spectacles and claiming to understand Sanskrit. I spent a spell out in Utah, dusty country it is, drier than a parched preacher's throat, and got a good gander at their ways. They’re industrious, I’ll give 'em that. Built themselves a city right out of the desert, Salt Lake, a veritable oasis of piety and well-tended gardens. Some say it’s the Lord’s doing, some say it’s irrigation, and I reckon it’s a healthy dose of both, mixed with a whole lot of hard labor. Brigham Young, now there was a man, looked like a prosperous banker with a touch of the prophet. Managed to keep those folks unified, which is no small feat when you consider the… multiplicity of wives some of 'em had.

Talk about a domestic challenge! Imagine trying to remember birthdays and anniversaries for… well, let’s just say a baker's dozen or two ladies. Why, a fella’d need a ledger just to keep track of the progeny! I did hear whispers, mind you, whispers of discontent and jealousy flitting around those neat, whitewashed houses like desert gnats, but nobody ever complained to me direct. They were too busy being righteous and building temples that gleamed like sugar candy castles in the sun. And honest to goodness, their Sunday sermons were longer than a freight train crossing the plains. One could grow a respectable beard sitting through one of those pronouncements. Still, they're a peaceable folk, mostly. Always ready with a helping hand and a stern word about the evils of tobacco and strong drink. Though, I did see one fella, a deacon no less, wink rather conspicuously while discussing the merits of temperance. Go figure. Seems even saints got their little weaknesses, like a mule with a hankering for corn. All in all, they’re a curious people, these Mormons, a bit like a religious experiment gone gloriously, bewilderingly right.
