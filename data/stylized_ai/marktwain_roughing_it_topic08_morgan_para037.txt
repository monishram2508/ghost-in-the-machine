Now, about this Morgan, mind you, he weren’t no desperado fresh off the boat from the Devil’s own shipyard, though he could certainly conjure up enough devilment to make a parson sweat. He drifted into town, dust clinging to him like remorse to a politician, driving a buckboard that looked like it had lost a fight with a tumbleweed and lost badly. Said he was a prospector, which in these parts meant he was either plumb loco, stone broke, or both – Morgan, truth be told, seemed to be a healthy dose of both. He’d stake a claim, swear he’d found a vein of gold wider than a church aisle, then next week be selling tin pans and claiming the gold had eloped with a traveling salesman. Folks took to calling him “Morgan the Magnificent Liar,” which was a tad uncharitable, seeing as how he genuinely believed his own whoppers half the time. He’d spend his nights in the saloon, nursing a lukewarm beer and regaling anyone within earshot with tales of his near-misses and almost-fortunes. He had this knack, Morgan did, for making even the most outlandish yarns sound plausible, at least until the daylight hit them full in the face. He’d describe nuggets the size of hen’s eggs, canyons paved with silver, and Indian burial grounds brimming with jewels. And he'd deliver these pronouncements with such earnest conviction, eyes glittering like a coyote spotting a stray chicken, that even the saltiest old-timers started to wonder if maybe, just maybe, he wasn’t completely off his rocker. Of course, come morning, the only thing Morgan usually found in his claim was more dust and a hangover that could curdle milk. But bless his fool heart, he never gave up, always convinced that the next shovel full would be the one to make him a king. He was a regular Don Quixote, battling windmills made of dust and dreaming of fortunes that existed only in the vast, untamed landscape of his own imagination. And you know, in a town like ours, that's almost as good as finding the real thing.
