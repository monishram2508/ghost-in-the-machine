Now, about this bucksheesh, this oriental lubricant that makes the gears of commerce and conviviality turn so smoothly in these foreign lands. One might call it bribery, and indeed, some stuffy moralizers do, likely the same sort who’d condemn a man for spitting on the floor just because the carpet isn't his own. But bribery carries with it the scent of corruption, of dark deeds done under cover of night, whereas bucksheesh, bless its ubiquitous soul, is often as open and airy as a Cairo marketplace. It's a tip, a gratuity, a small token of appreciation offered with a wink and a smile, meant to oil the wheels of progress, not grind them to a halt.

Why, I remember once, finding myself in a rather tight spot in Tangier, trying to navigate a labyrinthine alleyway while burdened with a rather cumbersome carpet – a genuine Persian, mind you, not one of those gaudy imitations. A local lad, no older than my nephew back in Hannibal, Missouri, offered to guide me through the maze. I, being a shrewd judge of character, saw the glint in his eye, the unspoken request shimmering in the air like the desert heat. A few coins exchanged hands, a quiet bucksheesh you might say, and suddenly, the alleyway seemed less daunting, the carpet lighter, and the lad transformed into a veritable Sherpa, leading me to my destination with the grace of a gazelle and the local knowledge of a seasoned camel driver.

Was it bribery? Perhaps, according to the letter of the law. But according to the spirit of the thing, it was simply…expedient. It greased the path, smoothed the edges, and allowed me, and the lad, to continue about our business without fuss or feathers. Of course, one must be wary of those who demand bucksheesh with a heavy hand and a greedy eye, for those are mere extortionists, cut from a different cloth entirely. But the honest bucksheesh, offered and received with good cheer and a light heart, is a valuable tool in these parts, a silent language understood by all, a reminder that a little kindness, even if prompted by the clink of coin, can go a long way in making the world a slightly more agreeable place, even if that place happens to be swarming with flies and overflowing with dubious street food.
