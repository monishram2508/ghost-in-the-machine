Damascus, bless its ancient heart, is a city that's been around since, well, probably before they invented dates for anything. You know, when folks just shrugged and said, "Oh, this? Just been here a while." And a while it has been. It’s got layers, see, thicker than a politician's promises. Each conqueror seems to have left a little something behind, a dab of paint here, a mosque minaret there, resulting in a hodgepodge that’s either charming or an architectural nightmare, depending on whether you’ve had your morning coffee or not. One can amble through the Souk al-Hamidiyah, a covered market stretching longer than a parson's sermon, dodging merchants with more zeal than a fly at a picnic, trying to hawk you everything from Turkish delight sweeter than a declaration of love, to silk carpets that cost more than a small country's GDP. And speaking of carpets, mind you watch your step. The streets are paved with more history than good intentions, and a stray ankle twist could send you tumbling back to the days of the Crusaders – though I suspect they had fewer options for complaining about it.

The Old City, now, is a maze that'd make a rat give up and move to Kansas. Winding alleys narrower than a church pew after Sunday dinner, houses practically leaning on each other for gossip, and the air thick with the scent of spices, jasmine, and something vaguely…historic. I suspect it's dust mixed with centuries of spilled coffee, a combination that’s surprisingly addictive. And the people! Oh, the Damascenes. They’ve seen empires rise and fall, they've probably bartered with Julius Caesar, and they possess a world-weariness that's both captivating and slightly unnerving. They'll offer you tea with a smile that could melt glaciers, and then try to sell you a camel with a wink that suggests it might only have three legs. It's a city of contrasts, Damascus is, a place where the call to prayer echoes alongside the honking of car horns, where ancient ruins stand defiant next to modern apartment blocks, and where you're just as likely to be offered a pomegranate as a piece of very, very frank advice. A delightful mess, it is, like a history book written by a committee of poets, politicians, and slightly mad carpet salesmen.
