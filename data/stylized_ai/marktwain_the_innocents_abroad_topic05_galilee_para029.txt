Now, Galilee, bless its simple, sun-baked heart. They call it a province, though I reckon it's more a frame of mind. A fella can't rightly swing a cat without hitting a fisherman, a farmer, or someone whittling away at a piece of olive wood, tryin' to make a donkey look like a Roman senator. The Sea of Galilee, or Lake Tiberias if you're feeling fancy and want to impress the ladies with your book-learnin', ain't exactly an ocean, mind you. More of a glorified pond, though the fishermen there treat it like the Atlantic, wrestling with nets full of fish that probably couldn't feed a church mouse.

The hills around are cluttered with more history than a used bookstore, from the days of Herod to…well, about five minutes ago, probably. Every rock has a story to tell, though mostly the stories involve sheep, taxes, and the ever-present argument over whose olive grove is better. The towns themselves, Nazareth, Capernaum – places that roll off the tongue like gravel – are full of dusty streets, children with runny noses, and the distinct aroma of fish frying in olive oil. I'd wager a good portion of the population’s livelihood depends on what the Sea of Galilee is feeling each morning. If it decides to be generous, folks eat; if not, they tighten their belts and complain about the Romans, or whoever else happens to be in charge at the time. 

It's a land where miracles reportedly happened, which is curious, seeing as how getting a decent cup of coffee there these days would be a minor miracle in itself. But there's a certain charm to the place, a sort of stubborn, unpretentious honesty that's harder to find than a politician with a clean conscience. Galilee doesn't put on airs. It is what it is – dusty, sun-kissed, and smelling faintly of fish. And a fella could do a lot worse than spending a lazy afternoon sitting by that glorified pond, watching the fishermen try to coax dinner out of its murky depths. Just be sure to bring a good hat and a healthy dose of patience, because Galilee, like a good mule, does things at its own pace, whether you like it or not.
