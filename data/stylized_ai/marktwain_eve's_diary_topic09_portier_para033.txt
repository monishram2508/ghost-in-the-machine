I'd seen many a grand house, bless you, more than you've likely had hot dinners, and they all suffered from the same malady. Drafts. Oh, the drafts! Invisible fiends that’d nip at your ankles and send shivers down your spine, no matter how high you piled the kindling in the hearth. So, when I first laid eyes on a portiere, hanging heavy and plush in the doorway between the parlor and the dining room at Mrs. Abernathy's, I confess I thought it a preposterous affectation. Something a woman of Mrs. Abernathy’s delicate constitution and even more delicate sensibilities would fancy, no doubt. More flounce than function, I reckoned. Probably embroidered with doves and forget-me-nots.

But there it hung, a tapestry of somber browns and greens, thick as a preacher’s pronouncements on a Sunday. And bless my buttons, it worked! It stopped the icy currents that usually raced through that house like runaway horses. And not only that, but it kept the clatter from the kitchen confined, shielding Mrs. Abernathy’s dainty ears from the unseemly banging and crashing that inevitably accompanies the preparation of a plum pudding. It was, in its own humble way, a miracle of modern engineering, far surpassing any of Mr. Edison’s contraptions, if you ask me. 

Of course, it did present certain unforeseen complications. One evening, when Mr. Abernathy, fortified by a generous helping of brandy, attempted to pass through it with undue haste, he became entangled in the folds, nearly pulling the entire contraption from the wall. He emerged looking like a badger that had lost a fight with a blackberry bush. But even he, after disentangling himself, and with a slightly bruised dignity, had to admit the portiere possessed a certain…utility. Besides, watching him struggle was worth a bushel of laughs and warmer toes to boot! It just goes to show you, sometimes the silliest looking things can offer the greatest comfort, even if it's at the expense of a poor, brandy-addled fellow's pride.
