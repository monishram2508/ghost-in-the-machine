Harris, that singular specimen of humankind, is a fellow best observed at a distance, preferably through a spyglass and from atop a sturdy fence. Not that he's dangerous, mind you, unless you happen to be a poorly conceived idea or a plate of untouched victuals. No, Harris is dangerous to tranquility, to sensible conversation, and to the general well-being of any upholstered furniture within a ten-mile radius. He possesses a mind that works like a runaway clock, striking thirteen whenever it takes a fancy to, and its chimes are invariably inaccurate and delivered at top volume. I recall once, and shudder even now at the memory, when he attempted to explain the theory of relativity using only a corkscrew, a lemon, and a particularly excitable terrier. The results, I assure you, were catastrophic, involving a ruined Persian rug, a distressed dog, and a profound bewilderment that lingers even to this day. He has a way of taking a perfectly straightforward situation, like, say, buttering a piece of bread, and transforming it into a philosophical conundrum of epic proportions. Is the butter inherently inclined towards the bread? Does the bread secretly resent the application of said butter? These are the questions that plague Harris, and by extension, anyone unlucky enough to be within earshot. He is, in essence, a walking, talking, gesticulating chaos engine, perpetually fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a complete disregard for the laws of physics, social decorum, or common sense. And yet, confound it all, there’s a certain...charm...to the scoundrel. A reckless, unpredictable charm, to be sure, like petting a wild badger, but a charm nonetheless. He is a reminder that the world, for all its pretensions of order and reason, is fundamentally absurd, and that sometimes, just sometimes, the most sensible thing to do is to simply laugh at the whole blessed, bewildering mess. Just, perhaps, laugh from a safe distance.
