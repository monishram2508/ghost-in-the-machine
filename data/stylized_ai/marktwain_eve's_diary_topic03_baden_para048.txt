Baden, they call it. A name that sounds suspiciously like a chap perpetually complaining of a soak too tepid for his liking. And a soak it is, a whole town practically wallowing in it, bubbling and hissing like a mischievous cauldron brewing up cures for ailments real and imagined. The place is overrun with the infirm, or those who suspect they shall soon be, all draped in enough cashmere to bankrupt a flock of Tibetan sheep. They sip the waters, these afflicted souls, with the pious grimace of a cat forced to swallow castor oil. I've been told it's meant to mend everything from gout to a tendency to hum Wagner at inappropriate moments, but I suspect its true purpose is to provide ample opportunity for gossip and the trading of outlandish theories regarding the Grand Duke's latest infatuation.

The women, bless their powdered noses, are a sight to behold. Bedecked in jewels that could illuminate a small village, they parade through the gardens like peacocks in a rainstorm, trailing clouds of lavender and scandal. Their husbands, or the men claiming to be, shuffle behind, resembling nothing so much as well-upholstered baggage carts resigned to their fate. The gaming tables, of course, are a spectacle of their own, a swirling vortex of anxiety and misplaced confidence. Fortunes are won and lost with the rapidity of a butterfly’s wingbeat, accompanied by sighs dramatic enough to wilt a rose garden. The air itself seems to crackle with avarice and the faint aroma of desperation. Yet, amidst all the posturing and pretense, there is a certain charm, a peculiar kind of theatricality. One can’t help but feel a grudging affection for this grand, slightly ridiculous charade. Baden, it seems, is a place where everyone comes to pretend they’re either dying or delightfully healthy, all while secretly hoping to overhear the juiciest bit of gossip before the next mineral bath. And for that, at least, it's worth the price of admission, and a bottle or two of the local wine, which, I might add, is mercifully immune to the purported healing properties of the cursed waters.
