Now, about this portier contraption. A most peculiar affair it is, draping itself across a doorway like a melancholic widow after a particularly disastrous card game. Back in the days when the world was flat and folks believed everything they read in newspapers, a portier, they said, was for keeping out drafts. Drafts! As if a thin piece of velvet could stand up to the bluster of a Missouri winter wind. That's like trying to stop the Mississippi with a teacup, I tell you. More likely, it was for keeping out Mrs. Higgins’ prize-winning begonias from the children’s sticky fingers.

But I suspicioned it had a grander, more devious purpose. I reckon it was invented by a fellow who craved a bit of privacy, the sort of chap who liked to hum opera in the nude but didn't want the parlor maid catching him at it. It allowed a fellow a moment to gather his thoughts, or perhaps to hide the evidence of a particularly robust game of checkers where he may have been cheating just a tad. It's a sort of "now you see me, now you don't" act for the home.

And the fabric! Always a grand statement, wouldn't you say? A portier screams of wealth or delusions of wealth, depending. Velvet for the swells, maybe a tapestry depicting some mythological horse chase for the erudite, and a patchwork quilt for the budget-minded home. Our own, alas, was of some indeterminate material, a sort of beige that suggested good intentions but ultimately admitted defeat in the face of gravy stains and curious cat claws. It served its purpose, though, that beastly thing, giving the house a sort of respectable air. A curtain of deception, if you would. Aye, that’s what it was. It hid a multitude of sins, that old portier, just like polite society itself. And like society, it was probably hiding behind it something much more interesting than it cared to let on.
