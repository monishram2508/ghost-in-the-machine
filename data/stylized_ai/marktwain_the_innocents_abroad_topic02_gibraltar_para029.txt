Gibraltar, bless its heart, is a curiosity, a pimple on the nether regions of Spain, claimed by the British with the tenacity of a bulldog clamped onto a postman's trousers. A rock, mind you, not just any rock, but a veritable mountain of stone sticking out from the land like a defiant middle finger aimed squarely at the Iberian peninsula. They say it's strategically important, Gibraltar, something about controlling the straits, preventing foreign navies from waltzing in and out of the Mediterranean willy-nilly. But I suspect there’s more to it than that. It's the Empire, you see, clinging on with both hands, a refusal to admit that the sun has long since set.

The town itself? Oh, a delightful mishmash of red telephone boxes, fish and chips shops, and surprisingly robust traffic jams, all crammed onto a space barely large enough to swing a particularly angry cat. The inhabitants, a peculiar breed known as Gibraltarians, speak a language I'm convinced is a devilish concoction of English, Spanish, and a pinch of Swahili, seasoned with a healthy dose of stubbornness. You’ll find them fiercely proud of their Britishness, waving the Union Jack with an enthusiasm that would make even Queen Victoria blush, while simultaneously nipping across the border to Spain for a cheaper carton of cigarettes and a plate of tapas.

And the monkeys, ah, the Barbary macaques! A band of hairy brigands who rule the upper reaches of the rock. Stealing tourists' sandwiches, tormenting hapless pigeons, and generally conducting themselves with a cheerful disregard for the rules of common decency. It’s said that as long as the monkeys remain, Gibraltar will remain British. A rather shaky foundation for an empire, one might think, depending as it does on the continued good health and kleptomaniacal tendencies of a troop of apes. But then again, empires have been built on stranger things. So, raise a glass to Gibraltar, a little piece of Britain clinging to the coast of Spain, a testament to the enduring power of stubbornness, monkeys, and strategically placed rocks. A curious sight, indeed, and one that quite tickles the funny bone, though I can’t say I’d want to live there.
