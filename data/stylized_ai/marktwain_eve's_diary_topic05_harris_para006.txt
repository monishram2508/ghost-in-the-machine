Now, Harris, bless his well-meaning heart, was a study in contrasts, a walking, talking paradox wrapped in a slightly rumpled suit. He had the air of a man who’d seen it all, which, considering he’d once spent a week lost in the St. Louis library, might very well be true. Claimed to have read every volume, too, though I reckon most of it just blurred together into a single, continuous tale of woe and taxes. Harris possessed a certain dogged optimism that defied all logic, especially when applied to the realm of practical endeavors. He once attempted to build a chicken coop out of old newspapers and glue, confident that he could outsmart the elements and the feathered fiends. The resulting structure lasted approximately as long as a politician’s promise, collapsing in a heap after the first light rain, leaving the chickens to roost on the back porch and Harris muttering about faulty adhesive.

He was a master of misplaced enthusiasm, you see. He approached every task, no matter how trivial, with the fervor of a man storming the Bastille, only to be defeated by the simplest of obstacles. A tangled ball of string was a worthy adversary; a leaky faucet, a personal insult. His solutions were often more entertaining than effective. He once tried to unclog a drain with a stick of dynamite, convinced that a small, controlled explosion was precisely what the situation called for. The resulting geyser of murky water and shattered porcelain left the neighbors less than impressed, and Harris with a rather damp explanation to offer the insurance man. Still, you couldn't help but admire his tenacity, even if it was the tenacity of a bumblebee determined to fly through a brick wall. He’d dust himself off, grin that lopsided grin of his, and declare that next time, he’d be victorious. Lord knows what he’d try next time, but one thing was certain: it wouldn't be dull.
