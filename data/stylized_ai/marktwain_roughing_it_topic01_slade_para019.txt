Slade, now there was a station! More alkali dust than honest dirt, I reckon, and situated in a place that God probably forgot to paint. I wouldn't call it a town, not by a long shot. More like a collection of sun-blistered shacks clinging to the Nevada desert like ticks to a hound dog. Why any sensible human, or even a mildly cracked one, would choose to settle there, I couldn't rightly fathom, unless maybe they'd lost a bet with the devil. The population, sparse as it was, consisted mainly of miners with faces like weathered leather and dispositions to match. They looked like they hadn’t seen water, besides the whiskey kind, in decades. You could crack a rock with their handshake.

The main street, so-called, was wide enough for a stagecoach and a stray dog to have a polite disagreement without bumping elbows. At its heart stood the saloon, naturally, its batwing doors flapping like a bored buzzard’s wings. Inside, the air was thick enough to chew, a potent mix of stale beer, cheap tobacco, and the faint scent of desperation. Gambling tables sat ready for a quick fleecing, and the piano player hammered out a tune that sounded like a cat being strangled, though nobody seemed to mind much, least of all the cat, I suppose, if it could even hear it over the general din.

I spent one long, sweltering day in Slade, mostly observing the local color, which was about as vibrant as a bleached bone. I saw a man try to sell a mule that clearly had one hoof in the grave, and another fellow argue with a tumbleweed about right-of-way. The highlight, though, was witnessing a dust devil pick up a tin can and parade it through town like it was a prize winning hog. Yes sir, Slade. A place where you could watch nature, in all its charming apathy, remind you that you were very, very small, and probably owed somebody money. Leaving felt like being pardoned from a sentence. I wouldn't recommend it as a vacation spot, unless your idea of relaxation involves sunstroke and existential angst.
