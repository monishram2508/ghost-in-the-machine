Zermatt, bless its little, snow-dusted heart, is a town that seems to have been conjured up by some fanciful Swiss watchmaker, each cog and gear of the municipality oiled with a picturesque precision that borders on the absurd. Imagine, if you will, a village nestled beneath the very crown of the Alps, so determined to preserve its pristine air that it has banished the internal combustion engine altogether! Carriages, drawn by weary-looking but undeniably handsome horses, clip-clop along cobbled streets, giving one the distinct impression of having stumbled onto a meticulously staged theatrical production. The natives, bless them, go about their business with a stoicism that suggests they find nothing remotely peculiar in their vehicle-free existence. Perhaps they are simply immune to the charm after years of hauling groceries by sled.

And the tourists! Ah, the tourists, a breed as varied and plentiful as snowflakes in an avalanche. There are the seasoned climbers, of course, their faces etched with the grim determination of those who have stared into the abyss (or at least up the Matterhorn) and lived to tell the tale. Then come the skiers, a flamboyant bunch dressed in colors that would make a peacock blush, carving down slopes with the reckless abandon of gamblers betting the farm. And of course, the obligatory gaggle of honeymooners, hand-in-hand, gazing at the Matterhorn with the same wide-eyed wonder one might reserve for the discovery of the New World, oblivious to the fact that it's been sitting there, unmoved, for a few million years. The shops, well, they offer every conceivable trinket adorned with the majestic peak. One can procure Matterhorn-shaped cheese graters, Matterhorn-themed cuckoo clocks (naturally), and even, I kid you not, Matterhorn-scented air fresheners. One wonders if the air actually smells of alpine pine and perpetual winter, or if some canny entrepreneur is bottling the essence of marketing brilliance.
