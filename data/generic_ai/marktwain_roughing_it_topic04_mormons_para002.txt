The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist religious movement that originated in the United States in the 19th century with Joseph Smith. At its core is a belief that the Christian church had fallen away from its original doctrine and practices and needed to be restored through divine intervention. Central to Mormon belief is the Book of Mormon, which Smith claimed to have translated from golden plates revealed to him by an angel. This book, along with the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, form the scriptural canon of the church. Mormons believe that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and that through faith in Him, repentance, baptism by immersion, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, individuals can obtain eternal life.

A distinctive feature of Mormonism is its emphasis on temple worship. These temples are considered sacred spaces where members participate in ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, endowments (a type of spiritual instruction and covenant-making), and eternal sealings, which bind families together for eternity. Missionary work is another significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving full-time missions for the church, proselytizing and engaging in service projects around the world. Family is also highly valued, and the church promotes traditional family structures and values. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a hierarchical structure with local congregations led by bishops and higher levels of leadership overseeing regions and the entire church. The current president of the church is considered a prophet, seer, and revelator, continuing to receive guidance from God. Over the years, the church has faced both praise and criticism for its theological beliefs, historical events, and social practices. Today, it is a global organization with millions of members worldwide, continuing to grow and evolve while remaining rooted in its foundational principles.
