Now, about that Colosseum, that monstrous, crumbling testament to barbarity they trot out for the tourists in Rome. It's a grand sight, I'll grant you that – a vast, hollowed-out maw of stone that looks like a giant toothache suffering from neglect. They'll tell you it seated fifty thousand souls, all eager to witness the spectacle of men hacking each other to bits and pieces, or maybe watching some poor lion enjoy a light luncheon of Christian appetizer. Fifty thousand, mind you, packed tighter than sardines in a tin, all hooting and hollering for blood. Makes you wonder what sort of depraved entertainment they had at home if *that* was considered a good night out.

One can almost hear the roar of the crowd echoing through the ages, a sound akin to a thousand rusty hinges groaning in unison, or perhaps the collective sighs of all the ghosts who’ve got stuck with a permanent season ticket. You wander through the ruins, dodging pigeons as bold as brass and vendors peddling miniature gladiators, fashioned, I suspect, from repurposed plumbing. You try to imagine the carnage, the sheer, unadulterated brutality, and I daresay, it's a bit difficult. It's easier to imagine the headache you'd have after listening to fifty thousand Italians argue about which chariot driver had the best haircut.

And the Romans, bless their souls (or curse them, depending on which gladiator you bet on). They built it to last, that much is certain. Built it like they intended to throw a party that would last for centuries, and in a morbid sort of way, they succeeded. Though I reckon they didn't imagine future generations would be clambering over the ruins, taking photographs with vacant expressions and buying those miniature gladiators. I suppose progress has its own curious ironies, doesn't it? Instead of blood and screams, we have selfie sticks and the faint aroma of cheap gelato. A definite improvement, I say, though perhaps not quite as profitable for the bookmakers.
