Chamonix, ah, Chamonix! A veritable anthill of humanity clinging to the foot of that frosty old giant, Mont Blanc, like so many over-eager leeches. One arrives expecting sublime solitude, communing with the very soul of the Alps, but finds instead a bustling bazaar where the currency is boasting rights and the merchandise, the latest in outlandish, brightly colored, and utterly unnecessary mountaineering paraphernalia. The streets are choked with a peculiar breed of tourist – the "Aspiring Alpinist," one might call them – decked out as if ready to conquer Everest single-handedly, yet trembling visibly at the prospect of crossing a moderately icy puddle. They strut about, brandishing their ice axes like decorative walking sticks, their faces perpetually fixed in a grim determination that suggests they are either bracing for a sudden blizzard or suffering from a particularly virulent form of indigestion.

The air, once so pristine one could practically bottle it and sell it to city dwellers, is now thick with the aroma of frying pommes frites and the cacophonous babble of a dozen different languages, all vying for supremacy. One hears pronouncements, delivered with the gravitas of a papal decree, on the optimal angle for ice screw placement, the merits of merino wool versus synthetic fleece, and the precise shade of blue that best complements one's glacier glasses. And everywhere, the clicking and whirring of cameras, relentlessly documenting every breathtaking view, every precarious step, every agonizingly slow ascent. For, what is the point of conquering a mountain if one cannot then bore one's friends and acquaintances with photographic evidence of the ordeal? It is a place, I confess, that inspires both awe and exasperation in equal measure; a magnificent landscape marred only by the self-importance of those who have come to appreciate its magnificence, though it appears more a competition to see who can display how much money they have spent. It seems there's no better way to ruin perfection than by having too many people arrive to look at it!
