Zermatt, you say? A village perched high in the Alps, so quaint it near drips with it, like a fondue pot overflowing with melted cheese. One arrives, naturally, by train; no vulgar carriages with noisome engines are permitted, thank you very much. This, I suspect, is less for the sake of the air, which is admittedly thinner than a politician’s promise at this altitude, and more for the preservation of the fragile sensibilities of the powdered-nose gentry who frequent the place. Why, the clatter of a horseless carriage might disrupt their earnest deliberations on the proper way to consume an apricot tart! The hotels are a sight to behold, all gingerbread trim and balconies practically daring you to slip off, offering views of the Matterhorn so breathtaking they threaten to permanently dislodge your jaw. The Matterhorn, of course, is the star of the show, a jagged, imposing fellow who seems to be perpetually judging the human foibles unfolding below. He stands there, unmoved by the incessant clicking of cameras and the breathless pronouncements of “Oh, how divine!” It's a wonder he doesn't sprout a monocle and simply scoff at the whole affair.

And the tourists! Goodness gracious, the tourists. A kaleidoscope of brightly-colored ski suits and bewildered expressions, stumbling about in search of the perfect souvenir cowbell. One sees them clutching maps like they're lost in the Labyrinth of Crete, while a hundred yards away, a sign points directly to the train station in letters large enough to be read from the moon. The shops, of course, are filled with the usual temptations – chocolates shaped like mountains (naturally), watches that cost more than a small Swiss village, and enough cuckoo clocks to drive a sane man stark raving mad. I even spotted a chap attempting to barter a slightly chewed cigar for a hand-knitted Edelweiss, a transaction which, I regret to inform you, did not conclude favorably for the cigar enthusiast. All in all, Zermatt is a charming, if somewhat theatrical, exercise in Alpine perfection. One leaves feeling both refreshed and slightly fleeced, a combination, I believe, that sums up the human condition quite nicely.
