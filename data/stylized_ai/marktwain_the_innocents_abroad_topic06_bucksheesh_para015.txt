Now, concerning this peculiar institution of the East, this so-called "bucksheesh," which sounds for all the world like a sneeze suppressed mid-gust—a sort of vocal hiccup, if you will—it is a thing that pervades the very air one breathes, thicker than the dust kicked up by a donkey cart on a Cairo street. A feller steps off the steamship expecting to be on his own two feet, independent as a hog on ice, and almost before he's planted them firmly on Egyptian soil, some rascal is tugging at his sleeve, hand outstretched and a whining voice uttering that ubiquitous plea: "Bucksheesh, effendi! Bucksheesh!" It commences with the customs official, who, after rummaging through your valise with all the delicacy of a bear pawing a honey pot, expects a little something for his trouble, mind you, even if he finds nothing more scandalous than a soiled shirt and a book of sermons. Then the dragoman, that self-appointed guardian of your ignorance, who promises to show you the wonders of the ancient world—for a price, of course, a price that invariably swells in direct proportion to your apparent gullibility. 

And the beggars! Good heavens, the beggars! They are as numerous as the flies buzzing around a camel's rump, and just as persistent. Crippled, blind, or merely lazy, they line the streets, each with a story guaranteed to melt the heart of even the most hardened miser—though I suspect many a heart remains unmelted, seeing as how they all seem to be making a tolerable living, or at least surviving. One suspects that the whole country operates on this system, from the humblest donkey boy to the most pompous pasha. It's a perpetual shakedown, a constant, low-grade extortion racket disguised as a gesture of goodwill. And the droll part is, after a while, you get used to it. Nay, you even come to expect it! You find yourself automatically reaching for your purse whenever someone so much as looks at you sideways. Bucksheesh becomes less an annoyance and more a form of social lubricant, a little grease to keep the wheels of daily life turning smoothly—or at least, less roughly. It's a queer business, this bucksheesh, a thing to be cursed and chuckled at in equal measure, a constant reminder that in this world, even the smallest of favors comes with a price, whispered on the wind in that everlasting, nasal drone: "Bucksheesh, effendi! Bucksheesh!"
