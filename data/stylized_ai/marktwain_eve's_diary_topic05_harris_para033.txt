Harris, now there’s a specimen worthy of study, akin to a particularly persistent fly buzzing 'round a molasses jug. He fancied himself a connoisseur of all things, Harris did, especially when it came to matters of the stomach. He’d pontificate on the proper aging of cheese as if he’d personally nursed the mold cultures from infancy. And don't even get him started on coffee. One morning, he spent a full hour describing the nuances of a particular bean, a bean, mind you, that tasted suspiciously like burnt dirt to my less refined palate. He spoke of its “earthy undertones” and “a hint of chocolate that dances playfully on the tongue.” I nearly choked trying not to laugh, imaging those chocolate hints doing the can-can on my poor tongue as it desperately searched for anything resembling coffee flavor. 

But Harris, bless his deluded heart, was utterly sincere. It was that very sincerity, that unwavering belief in his own pronouncements, that made him so…well, so Harris-like. He possessed a gift for exaggeration that would make a fishmonger blush. If a simple rain shower came along, Harris would declare it a deluge of Biblical proportions, threatening to wash away the very foundations of civilization. If he stubbed his toe, it was always a compound fracture, threatening permanent disability and a lifetime supply of crutches. He never did learn to whistle, which he proclaimed a musical tragedy of unparalled scope.

His observations on the human condition were equally…unique. He believed, with a fervor usually reserved for religious fanatics, that the primary motivation of every single person was to inconvenience him. A delayed train? A conspiracy to ruin his perfectly planned afternoon. A misplaced newspaper? A deliberate act of sabotage designed to deprive him of his morning news. The funny thing is, despite all his quirks and his rather impressive capacity for self-importance, there was something genuinely…endearing about the man. Perhaps it was the sheer audacity of his convictions, or maybe it was the comforting predictability of his grumbling, I couldn't say for sure. But Harris was Harris, and the world, however slightly skewed it may have been through his particular lens, was always a more amusing place with him in it.
