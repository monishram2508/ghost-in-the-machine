Ah, the Coliseum! A monstrous, crumbling amphitheater, like some petrified leviathan washed ashore after a particularly rowdy sea battle. One can scarce imagine the spectacle it once held, though the guide assures us it was nothing short of glorious—lions munching on Christians, gladiators hacking away at each other with all the grace of butchers wrestling an unruly hog, and emperors giving the thumbs-up or thumbs-down with the capricious whim of a cat batting at a dust bunny. I daresay a modern boxing match in a smoke-filled saloon would seem downright tame in comparison.

And the crowds! Imagine the roaring, baying throng, a sea of humanity eager to see a good bloodletting before heading home for a hearty supper. One wonders if they felt a pang of guilt watching some poor fellow get gored by a bull, or if they simply chuckled and remarked, "Well, he should have dodged better!" I suspect the latter. Man, in his infinite capacity for cruelty, does enjoy a good show, especially if it involves someone else's misfortune. Even these modern Romans, with their Vespas and espresso, will gather around a fender-bender like vultures descending on a carcass.

Now, much of the marble is pilfered, I reckon, for palaces and churches, leaving behind a skeleton of brick and regret. You can practically hear the ghosts of gladiators grumbling about the lousy pay and the even lousier healthcare. But still, stand within those ruined arches, squint your eyes a bit, and you can almost see it: the sand stained crimson, the sun glinting off the polished shields, the emperor looking bored. It is a grim reminder, wouldn't you say, of the fleeting nature of glory, the fickle tastes of the mob, and the undeniable human propensity for mayhem and the high possibility of finding a vendor selling a knock-off gladiator helmet for an exorbitant price nearby. Makes one long for a quiet afternoon with a good book and a stiff drink, away from the echoes of bloodthirsty applause.
