Brigham Young, now there's a figure fit for a dime novel, only you’d need to buy a whole stack of them to contain all the wives and wilderness-taming he got up to. Salt Lake City, you see, was his grand scheme, a desert blossoming like a Mormon Sunday hat, all because he squinted westward and declared, "This is the place!" Which, for a fella who led a whole swarm of folks across half a continent, you’d reckon he’d have picked a spot with a mite more water and a fewer crickets. But no, Brigham knew what he was about, or at least acted like he did, which, between you and me, is half the battle in this world. He was a master of the raised eyebrow and the meaningful silence, a skill that could convince a man to trade his horse for a handful of desert sand, just on the notion that Brigham knew something he didn't.

He was, by all accounts, a shrewd one, that Brigham. Some called him a prophet, some called him a despot, I reckon he was probably a little of both, mixed in with a healthy dose of frontier ingenuity. He built temples and tabernacles, irrigation ditches and social structures, all on the back of sheer willpower and a peculiar brand of community spirit that involved everyone doing precisely what he said. And those wives! Lordy, the stories those petticoats could tell. Enough to fill a library and probably cause a small earthquake besides. You hear tales of him dispensing advice, settling squabbles, and generally keeping the domestic peace amongst that sprawling family of his. Makes a man wonder if he slept at all, or if he just stood on the highest mountain peak, orchestrating the whole shebang with a wave of his hand and a stern look. Whether he was a divinely inspired leader or just a darn clever politician, Brigham Young left his mark on this country, a mark that's still plain as day, even if it's sometimes a bit dusty and prone to attracting the occasional tourist gawking at the Beehive House.
