Chamonix, they call it, and a fitting name it is, conjuring visions of chamois prancing upon towering peaks, though truth be told, I saw nary a one, save for those embroidered on the purses clutched by the fair Parisian ladies who seemed far more interested in the price of trinkets than the majesty of Mont Blanc itself. Mont Blanc, mind you, that great white whale of a mountain, looming over the valley like a grumpy old uncle perpetually scowling at the proceedings below. One can't help but feel a trifle intimidated, though perhaps that's merely the altitude whispering deceptive notions into one's ear. The air itself is thin and pretentious, demanding you breathe deeper, yet offering precious little reward for the effort. And the tourists! A veritable plague of them, swarming through the cobblestone streets, armed with cameras the size of small cannon and a burning desire to capture the perfect photograph of… well, anything, really. A cowbell, a geranium, a particularly picturesque cobblestone – nothing escapes their relentless lens. I overheard one fellow, boasting to his companion, that he had taken no less than 37 pictures of a snow-capped peak, each indistinguishable from the last, save for the angle of the sun and the fleeting shadow of a passing cloud. Such dedication to the art of redundancy! The restaurants, of course, cater to this onslaught of visitors, offering fondue at prices that would make a Swiss banker blush. One is given the impression that cheese, in Chamonix, is more valuable than gold, and perhaps it is. At least one can eat gold, though I wouldn’t recommend it, unless one has a particular fondness for indigestion. All in all, Chamonix is a curious spectacle, a potent cocktail of breathtaking scenery and breathless tourists, a place where one can simultaneously feel awed by the grandeur of nature and profoundly exasperated by the absurdity of humankind. It is, in short, a place worth seeing, provided one brings a sturdy pair of boots, a healthy dose of skepticism, and a bottomless pocketbook.
