Zermatt, you see, is a village clinging to the base of the Matterhorn like a lovesick tick, only considerably more picturesque, I daresay. A place where the air is so crisp it fairly snaps at your lungs, a bracing welcome to a world apparently untouched by the infernal racket of progress. One arrives, of course, not in some belching, infernal locomotive demon, but by a conveyance more akin to a glorified bread wagon drawn by electricity – a silent, almost apologetic admission that perhaps progress, like a poorly trained terrier, has been allowed too much freedom. And the horses! Oh, the horses of Zermatt, burdened with hauling everything from tourists’ mountainous valises (containing, one suspects, half the contents of a Parisian milliner’s shop) to fresh bread and enough cheese to sink a small Alp. They plod along, patient and long-suffering, their eyes reflecting a wisdom born of knowing that the human race, for all its supposed cleverness, is capable of requiring an entire wardrobe simply to descend a snow-covered hill.

The locals, they are a curious bunch – taciturn as granite one moment, exploding into peals of laughter at some private joke the next. They seem to observe the tourists with an almost clinical detachment, like naturalists studying an particularly flamboyant species of migratory bird, and probably taking notes on their plumage and peculiar mating rituals. The Matterhorn, of course, dominates everything. It is the grand old dame of the landscape, forever posing for portraits, draped in a perpetual shroud of cloud that shifts and swirls like a particularly temperamental opera singer's shawl. One suspects it rather enjoys the attention, and the sheer volume of photographic evidence devoted to its profile suggests it might soon demand royalties. And the skiing! Imagine, if you will, the sensation of being chased down a mountainside by a blizzard in a pair of overly polished wooden planks, and you are only halfway there. It is a grand, exhilarating madness, only made palatable by the knowledge that at the bottom awaits a steaming mug of something hot and alcoholic, and a chance to recount your near-death experience to anyone unfortunate enough to listen. A truly civilized pursuit, wouldn't you agree?
