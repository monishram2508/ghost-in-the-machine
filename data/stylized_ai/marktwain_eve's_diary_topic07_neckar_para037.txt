Now, there's the Neckar, a river they call it. Though, to my mind, it’s more like a lazy, green-tinged serpent, coiled loosely around the knees of these German hills. A body can’t help but observe its languid course, especially when sitting, as I often am, with a respectable stein of something amber and frothy within arm's reach. They tell you it's a river of commerce, bustling with barges laden with, well, goodness knows what sort of German industry churns out these days; probably sausages and philosophical tracts, judging by the temperament of the inhabitants. But to me, it seems more inclined towards contemplation, a glassy surface reflecting the sky as if pondering the imponderable questions of existence.

And Lord, the castles that perch upon its banks! Enough feudal architecture to populate a small country. Each one vying for attention, boasting of battles fought and glories won, all the while decaying slowly, like so many aged relatives stubbornly clinging to their ancestral estates. They stand there, proud and picturesque, as if daring the modern world to surpass their grandeur. One almost expects a knight in shining armor to come charging forth, only to be confronted by a gaggle of tourists wielding selfie sticks.

The riverboats, too, are a curious sight. Little floating parlors, filled with folks eager for a scenic view and, I suspect, an abundance of cake. They chug along, oblivious to the undercurrent of historical significance, their passengers more concerned with capturing the perfect photograph than contemplating the ghosts of emperors and poets. One imagines the Neckar, in its own watery way, chuckling softly at the parade of human folly unfolding upon its bosom. It's seen it all before, you see – the rise and fall of empires, the fleeting passions of men, and the endless, unwavering pursuit of the perfect piece of Black Forest cake. And I daresay, it'll see it all again. The river simply flows on, a silent witness to the grand comedy, or tragedy, depending on how one chooses to view it, of human existence.
