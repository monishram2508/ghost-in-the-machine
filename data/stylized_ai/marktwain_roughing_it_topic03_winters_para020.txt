Winter, that cantankerous old coot, descends upon these parts with all the subtlety of a runaway stagecoach careening down a mountainside. One minute you're swatting flies and dreaming of lemonade, and the next, why, you're buried up to your armpits in snow that's colder than a banker's heart. Folks 'round here like to talk about "winter wonderlands" and "the magic of the season," but I tell you, that's just city folk talk, born of too much eggnog and not enough shoveling. The only magic I see is the magic trick of my fingers disappearing inside my gloves, only to reappear looking like frostbitten sausages.

It's a trying time, winter is. Everything slows to a crawl, except maybe the icicles hanging off the eaves, which grow faster than a politician's promises. The animals, smarter than most people I know, hole up in their dens and burrows, leaving us poor saps to brave the elements. You got your wood to chop, your fires to stoke, and your prayers to say, because if the wind howls just right (or rather, just wrong), it'll whistle right through the cracks in your cabin like a banshee on a bender. And don't even get me started on the roads. They turn into treacherous skating rinks where even the most seasoned mules look like they're auditioning for a ballet. More than one fellow I've known has ended up in a snowdrift, swearing he'd rather face a grizzly bear than another patch of black ice.

But I suppose there’s a certain charm to it all, a certain rustic poetry found in the starkness of the landscape. And when the sun does decide to peek through the clouds, painting the snow-covered mountains in hues of gold and rose, well, even a cynical old buzzard like myself has to admit it’s a sight to behold. Though, I’ll still be glad when that rambunctious old coot, winter, packs his bags and heads north for a spell, leaving behind a bit of sunshine and a whole lot less shoveling.
