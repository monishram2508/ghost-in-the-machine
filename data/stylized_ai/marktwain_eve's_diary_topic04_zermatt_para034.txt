Zermatt, they call it, tucked away up there amongst the Alps like a mischievous child hiding in a snowdrift. A quaint little village it is, or was, until the tourists descended upon it like locusts on a wheat field, all armed with their peculiar contraptions – skis that look for all the world like planks of wood designed for some outlandish aquatic endeavor, and boots that could cripple a mule. Now, it's a bustling hive of activity, a veritable ant colony built on the premise of sliding downhill at perilous speeds. One can scarce take a step without risking being run over by a rosy-cheeked fellow who looks as though he's just escaped from a peppermint stick factory. The air, bless its heart, is crisp enough to shatter glass, and the Matterhorn, looming overhead like a disapproving aunt, keeps a watchful eye on the whole proceedings. They say it's majestic, and I suppose it is, if you're partial to rocks that reach for the heavens. Personally, I prefer a good cigar and a comfortable chair.

The hotels are, of course, filled with the sort of people who have made a fine art of spending money. They dress in attire that seems to be made entirely of goose feathers and spend their days hurtling down mountains and their evenings recounting their near-death experiences with a level of enthusiasm that is frankly, alarming. I suspect half of them are secretly hoping to break a leg, just for the attention it would garner. And the food! Swiss cuisine, they call it. All fondue and rösti, which, if I'm being honest, tastes suspiciously like something a resourceful peasant would whip up when the cupboard was bare. Still, it's all part of the spectacle, I suppose. One must suffer a little indigestión and witness a few near-fatal tumbles in order to appreciate the sheer audacity of it all. After all, what else is one to do with one’s time but observe the folly of mankind from a safe distance, preferably with a glass of something strong in hand?
