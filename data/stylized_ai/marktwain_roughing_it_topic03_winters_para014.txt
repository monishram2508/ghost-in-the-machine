Winter, you see, is a whole other animal out here in the territories, not like those namby-pamby affairs back East where folks fret over a little frost and start hollering for their furs at the first sight of a snowflake. Out here, winter comes at you like a runaway stagecoach careening down a mountainside – no polite warnings, just a howling blizzard and a bone-deep chill that'll turn your mustache to a solid block of ice before you can say "Jack Robinson." And the snow! Lord, the snow falls like the sky's sprung a leak, piling up in drifts that’d bury a church steeple and make you swear the Almighty’s decided to pave the whole darn place white.

Now, I ain’t saying it’s all bad. There’s a certain grim satisfaction to be had in outsmarting the elements, of a sort. You huddle around a fire that’s trying its darnedest to turn the cabin into a bake oven, gnawing on a slab of salt pork that’s tougher than shoe leather, and tell yourself you're a regular pioneer, a regular Daniel Boone, even as your toes are slowly petrifying. And the quiet! Why, when the wind ain’t howling like a banshee, the silence is so thick you could spread it on your bread. You could hear a pin drop a mile away, if anyone was foolish enough to be dropping pins in that sort of weather.

And then there's the wildlife, bless their cotton socks. The squirrels, plump as little sausages, desperately trying to remember where they buried their nuts, and the deer, looking as forlorn as a lost gambler after a losing streak. You almost feel sorry for them, until you remember you need to eat to survive, and that buck’s looking mighty tempting hanging in the shed. Winter, it’s a time for reflection, for appreciating the simple things like a warm bed (if you got one), a full belly (if you're lucky), and the sheer dogged determination to wake up and face another day of frozen misery. It's a trial, a test, a right proper humbug – but Lord knows, it makes springtime all the sweeter.
