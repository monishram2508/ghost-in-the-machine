Well, Eve, my dear, let's have a little discourse about the chamois, shall we? This creature, mind you, is not to be confused with those infernal cloths Adam uses to polish his fig leaves; though, come to think of it, a chamois hide would likely improve his lot considerably. No, this chamois, see, is a goat-antelope hybrid – as peculiar a notion as combining a hummingbird with an elephant, if you ask me, but Nature, bless her erratic heart, clearly had a whimsical day. They prance about the Alps, or maybe it’s the Pyrenees – one mountain range is as good as another when you’re observing from afar and aren't inclined to test its jaggedness. They seem to enjoy bounding up impossibly steep inclines, which I suspect is less out of any sporting inclination and more an attempt to get as far away from us meddling humans as possible. Can't say I blame them.

And they're quite the fashion plates, in their own way. Sporting a brown coat in summer, shifting to a dignified black in winter – a chameleon of the hills, albeit one lacking the common courtesy to change color when *I* approach. Their horns, little curved hooks, give them an air of perpetually questioning the state of the universe, or perhaps just wondering where the next patch of edelweiss might be lurking. And bless me, they’re cautious creatures, always on the lookout for danger, as though they expect to be accosted by tax collectors or door-to-door salesmen on those very peaks. Which, considering the ways of humanity, is a not entirely unreasonable fear. I've watched them for hours, my dear, these chamois, and I confess, I’ve grown fond of their skittish elegance. They’re a reminder that even in the most unforgiving landscapes, life, in all its improbable and slightly comical glory, will find a way to cling on, and likely give us a bit of a chase whilst doing it.
