Now, Galilee, there's a region for you! A modest little place, mind you, no grand pyramids or Colosseums to boast of, but possessing a charm all its own, like a slightly rumpled, but good-natured, gentleman. They call it a district, though I swear a determined crow, with a decent pair of wings, could fly across the whole thing before dinnertime. Mostly rolling hills it is, not mountainous, mind you, nothing to frighten the horses. Just amiable slopes covered with olive groves, their leaves a shimmering silver in the sun, looking for all the world like they're trying to signal to the heavens with tiny mirrors. The Sea of Galilee, though more of a lake if you ask me, is the main attraction, a shimmering blue eye in the center of it all. Fish swarm in it, they say, enough to feed a small army, or at least a particularly hungry preacher and his disciples. 

The towns scattered around are like sleepy little hamlets, Nazareth, Capernaum, Magdala, names that trip off the tongue like half-remembered tunes. The houses are built of stone, sturdy and practical, no frills to speak of, the kind of dwellings that say, "I'm here, I'm solid, and I'm not going anywhere." The people, ah, the people of Galilee! Weather-beaten fellows, tanned by the sun and toughened by the land. They're a simple lot, mostly farmers and fishermen, with a shrewdness in their eyes that suggests they know a good deal more than they let on. They’re devout, too, clinging to their traditions with a tenacity that would make a bulldog envious. Their faith, like their land, is something they hold close, a comfort and a guide in a world that's often perplexing and occasionally downright irritating. One hears, of course, tales of miracles and divine interventions, but one must take such accounts with a grain of salt, or perhaps a whole shaker of it, depending on the source. Still, one can't help but feel there's something special about Galilee, a quiet dignity, a serene beauty that lingers in the air, leaving you with the distinct impression that you've witnessed something truly unique, even if you can't quite put your finger on what it is. It’s a place, I daresay, that even the most hardened cynic might find a sliver of poetry in.
