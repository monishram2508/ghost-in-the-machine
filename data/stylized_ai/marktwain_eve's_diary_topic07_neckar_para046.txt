The Neckar, bless its meandering heart, isn't quite the Mississippi, mind you, nor does it have the self-importance of the Rhine, puffing itself up with tales of Lorelei and warring kings. No, the Neckar is more like that amiable, slightly awkward cousin you only see at family reunions – pleasant enough, you know, and perfectly serviceable, but not exactly destined for legendary ballads. It ambles along, you see, through southwestern Germany with the leisurely air of a man who’s already missed his train and has decided to enjoy the scenery regardless. It hasn’t a roaring rapid in its entire length, I suspect, preferring instead to ripple gently past vineyards clinging to steep hillsides, like grapes desperately trying to escape a pressing engagement.

One finds towns huddled on its banks, each seemingly more charmingly medieval than the last, as if a mischievous stagehand had forgotten to strike the set from a centuries-old production. Heidelberg, of course, lords over a stretch of the river, its castle a grand, crumbling testament to the fact that even the best-laid battle plans can't account for a good thunderstorm and a healthy dose of neglect. You’ll find boatmen offering tours, of course, filled with tales of ghosts and historical figures, though I daresay the ghosts are more likely to be bored than malevolent, and the historical figures probably preferred wine to whatever dry discourse they're being saddled with. One can't help but feel a touch of sympathy for them, stuck in a never-ending loop of boat trips and anecdotes. The river, in its own quiet way, bears witness to it all, its waters reflecting the passing clouds and the ambitions of mankind with equal indifference. I imagine it’s seen it all before, and, knowing human nature as it does, expects to see it all again. It’s a steady eddy in a world determined to churn, and for that, at least, it deserves a bit of respect.
