Well, I declare, if there ain't something peculiar and fascinating about a glacier! Seems to me like a big, slow-motion river of ice, only instead of rushing off to some ocean to make a nuisance of itself, it takes its own sweet time. Why, a fella could set up a hammock right on top of one and take a nap, and wake up a week later scarcely further along. Though I wouldn't recommend it, mind you, unless you're partial to a frosty bottom and the kind of complexion that'd scare a polar bear. They tell me these glaciers, they're made of snow, compressed by its own weight. Snow! Can you imagine? Seems a mighty impractical thing to build a river out of, if you ask me. Like trying to build a barn out of buttermilk.

And the way they carve up the landscape! Grinding down mountains like a dentist with a particularly stubborn molar. Leaving behind valleys that look like God Almighty had a bad day with a chisel. And those rocks! They drag 'em along for miles, big boulders the size of houses, then just up and plop 'em down wherever they feel like it. A fella could spend a lifetime trying to figure out the sense in it, and I reckon he'd be just as dumbfounded at the end as he was at the start. Though I suppose if you're a glacier, you don't much care for sense. You just rumble along, doing whatever a glacier does, which mostly seems to involve moving at a snail's pace and leaving a trail of destruction behind you. I reckon Mother Nature has her own curious way of keeping house. Still, I can't help but think that if she'd just give me a bit of control over these glaciers, I could use them for some proper cooling in the summer and perhaps make a fancy ice sculpture or two. Of course, the neighbours might complain.
