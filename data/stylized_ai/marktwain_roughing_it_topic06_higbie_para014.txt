Higbie, now there's a name that conjures up images of, well, mostly dust devils and stunted sagebrush, seasoned with a healthy dose of disappointment. He hailed, if you could call it that, from somewhere back East where they presumably knew which end of a shovel to hold, but the Nevada sun soon baked any pretense of knowledge right out of him. He arrived in Virginia City with dreams bigger than the Comstock Lode itself, visions of silver nuggets practically leaping into his pockets. Turns out, those nuggets were mostly mirages, and his pockets ended up housing more holes than silver. He claimed to be a mining expert, a veritable professor of prospecting, but his expertise seemed limited to arguing with claim jumpers and misidentifying fool's gold. You'd think a man who tripped over more rocks than a mountain goat would develop a knack for spotting the real McCoy, but not Higbie.

I swear, I once saw him examine a particularly shiny piece of mica with the intensity of a scholar deciphering hieroglyphics, only to declare it the motherlode and immediately offer me half for the price of a stale biscuit. Now, I’m no geologist, but even a blind mule could tell the difference between mica and solid silver. The man possessed a certain… enthusiasm, let's call it, that was both endearing and utterly baffling. He could lose his shirt in a poker game one minute and be sketching grand plans for a hydraulic mining operation the next, entirely unfazed by the fact that he hadn't even located water, let alone a vein of ore worth blasting. He was a walking, talking embodiment of optimistic delusion, a human testament to the fact that hope springs eternal, even in the desert where hope is about as common as a rainy day in July. He was a character, alright, though whether a character in a comedy or a tragedy was still up for debate, and I suspect the final verdict would depend largely on whether he ever managed to strike it rich, or just struck out one too many times.
