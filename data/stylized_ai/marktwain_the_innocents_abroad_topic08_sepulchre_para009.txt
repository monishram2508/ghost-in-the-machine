A sepulchre, now that's a word with a mouthful of dust and a graveyard echo clinging to it, isn't it? Not a cheerful sort of thing, mind you, unless you’re one of those antiquarian fellas who get a thrill out of deciphering moldy inscriptions and poking around in damp corners where the sun forgot to shine. Me, I prefer my scenery with a bit more life to it, less about the deceased and more about the doings of the breathing. But a sepulchre it is, and a sepulchre it shall be, since you've asked. Take, for instance, them grand affairs built by Pharaohs back in Egypt, those pyramids fit to house a small town and stuffed to the gills with gold trinkets, enough to make a saint contemplate a bit of larceny. Imagine the fella who gets the job of cleaning those out, bless his soul, that's one dusty career. Then there are those little, unassuming sepulchres, tucked away in some forgotten corner of a churchyard, barely bigger than a doghouse. Likely holds some farmer who spent his days arguing with the cows and his evenings snoring louder than a runaway locomotive. Either way, grand or humble, they’re all the same in the end, just boxes full of bones and memories, the earthly remnants of folks who once had opinions, ambitions, maybe even a decent sense of humor. Makes you think, doesn't it? All that striving and fretting, all the to-do about this and that, and in the end, you're just another tenant in the real estate of the departed, sharing a roof with the worms and the damp. Some say it’s a somber thought, but I reckon it's just a good reminder to live a little louder while you still can, before you're reduced to a sepulchre and a historical footnote. Although, let’s be honest, even the footnote might get smudged with time.
