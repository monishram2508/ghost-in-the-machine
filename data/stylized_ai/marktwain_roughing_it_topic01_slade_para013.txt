Slade, now there was a town to be reckoned with – a rawboned, two-fisted sort of place that'd chew you up and spit you out quicker than you could say "Jack Robinson." Situated in that blighted wasteland between Carson City and the mysteries of the Great Basin, Slade was a testament to what happens when greed and grit decide to shack up and raise a family. Population, near as I could tell, fluctuated depending on the price of silver and whether the local saloon had run out of rotgut whiskey. Buildings were a hodgepodge affair, all slapped together with more enthusiasm than architectural talent. You’d see a clapboard shack leaning against a brick edifice, a tent saloon sandwiched between a blacksmith's shop and a place selling "medicinal herbs" that smelled suspiciously like opium.

The people, oh, the people of Slade! A finer collection of scoundrels, desperadoes, and general ne'er-do-wells you’d be hard-pressed to find this side of the Mississippi. Prospectors, gamblers, dance-hall girls with hearts of pyrite, and that breed of lawyer who'd argue a rooster into laying eggs – they were all there, jostling for a piece of the pie. Every man carried a pistol, not necessarily for protection, mind you, but more as a fashion statement. Conversations were liberally peppered with threats and boasts, and the sound of gunfire was as common as the braying of a jackass.

But, underneath all the bluster and lawlessness, there was a certain rough-and-tumble charm to Slade. Folks were honest in their dishonesty, if you catch my drift. A man might cheat you at poker, but he'd also help you fix a broken wagon wheel, provided it didn’t cut into his drinking time. And despite the frequent brawls and occasional hangings, there was a sense of community – a shared understanding that they were all in this godforsaken place together, trying to scratch a living from the unforgiving earth. It might not be paradise, but it was home, and by thunder, they were going to make the most of it, even if it killed them. Which, more often than not, it did.
