Harris, now there's a specimen. A man seemingly born with a permanent crease in his brow, like life itself had tried to fold him up and shove him in a pocket. He’d walk into a room and the furniture would shift nervously, expecting some sort of judgement. Not that he was overtly unpleasant, mind you, just… intensely observant. The kind of fellow who'd stare at a freshly painted fence and declare, with all the conviction of a seasoned art critic, that the third coat was applied on a Tuesday, and by a man whose lunch consisted solely of underripe peaches. And he'd be right, too, confound him.

He possessed a thirst for knowledge, bless his heart, but of the most peculiar variety. He wouldn’t bother with Shakespeare or the classics, heavens no. His library, if you could call it that, consisted of pamphlets on the migratory habits of dung beetles, treatises on the proper application of mustard to a ham sandwich, and, for some reason, a heavily annotated copy of a livestock auctioneer's manual. He claimed it was "essential reading for understanding the nuances of human interaction," a statement I suspect he delivered with a perfectly straight face.

Now, Harris was a bachelor, and I reckon that comes as no surprise. Any woman who could tolerate that level of detailed scrutiny – that constant, low-level hum of analysis directed squarely at her hat, her shoes, the way she buttered her toast – well, she’d be either a saint or a taxidermist, probably both. Though, in his defense, he did have a certain, shall we say, *unique* charm. He was utterly, irredeemably himself, and in a world overflowing with carefully constructed personas, that was a refreshing anomaly. He was a walking, talking, tweed-clad oddity, and if he didn't quite fit into polite society, he certainly made it a darn sight more interesting. The world needs its Harris', you see, if only to remind us that normalcy is a wildly overrated pursuit.
