Gibraltar, bless its heart, is a peculiar sort of place, like a stray dog wearing a tiny admiral’s hat. Imagine, if you will, a colossal hunk of limestone, thrust rudely out of the sea, daring anyone to ignore its presence. And the British, ever the sporting fellows, decided they rather liked the look of it and planted their flag atop, as one might stick a cocktail umbrella in a particularly audacious pineapple. It's a fortress, they say, impregnable. I half expected to see King Arthur emerge from its caves brandishing Excalibur, ready to repel the Spanish Armada once more, only to find instead a troop of khaki-clad chaps sipping tea and complaining about the price of Marmite.

The town itself is a jumble, a delightful chaos of cobbled streets and duty-free shops hawking perfume that likely smells of regret by the time you get it home. The inhabitants, a hardy bunch, seem to possess an almost superhuman ability to navigate the narrow lanes dodging scooters driven by fellows who appear to be perpetually late for a very important appointment with destiny, or perhaps just a really good tapas bar. And then there are the Barbary macaques, those impudent simians who rule the upper reaches of the Rock with a tyrannical glee. One imagines them holding court, plotting mischief, perhaps even penning pamphlets on the evils of tourism while filching a biscuit from an unsuspecting visitor. They are, I suspect, the true rulers of Gibraltar, with the governor merely a figurehead appointed to keep the banana supply constant.

It's a place of contrasts, Gibraltar is. A pinch of England, a dash of Spain, a liberal dose of rock and sea, and a generous helping of sheer, unadulterated peculiarity. One can stand atop its heights, gazing across the straits to Africa, feeling the weight of history and the salty tang of the Mediterranean. And one can also, five minutes later, be jostled by a monkey trying to steal your sunglasses. A fitting metaphor, I reckon, for the whole, delightful, improbable, thoroughly British oddity that is Gibraltar. A gem, perhaps, but a gem one keeps in a rather battered tin.
