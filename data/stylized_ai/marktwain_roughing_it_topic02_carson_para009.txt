Carson City, you ask? Well, now there's a spectacle for sore eyes and a balm to the weary soul – if your soul happens to thrive on dust devils and the occasional stray jackrabbit. I reckon I've seen settlements with more charm sprouted from a tin of stale biscuits, but none so brazen in its claim to be a "city." Imagine a fellow dressed in his Sunday best, only his Sunday best consists of buckskins held together by hope and the occasional well-placed cactus spine. That's Carson City, pretending to be something grander than it is, bless its ambitious little heart. The streets? More like suggestions, really, laid out with the precision of a drunkard trying to draw a straight line on a runaway mule. And the buildings! Oh, the buildings – mostly wood, of course, seasoned by sun and sand into a peculiar shade of brown that reminds one of a well-worn saddle. You'll find a smattering of brick here and there, trying to put on airs, no doubt bought and paid for with silver from the Comstock.

The inhabitants? A curious assortment, to be sure. Miners with eyes perpetually squinted from the glare of the sun and pockets jingling, lawyers quicker to draw up a contract than a pistol, and a whole host of shopkeepers, each convinced they're about to strike it rich by selling shovels to men who’ve already dug themselves a fortune. And the politics! A tangled web of self-interest and backroom deals thicker than a prairie dog burrow. One can almost hear the rustle of promises whispered on the wind, each one worth about as much as a counterfeit dollar. But mind you, there's a certain raw, unvarnished honesty about the place. What you see is what you get, and what you get might be a whole heap of nothing, but at least it's honestly gotten. It's a rough and tumble town, Carson City, a place where dreams are as likely to get kicked to the curb as they are to blossom. Still, there's a pulse to it, a wild and untamed energy that keeps you coming back for more, even when your boots are full of dust and your pockets are as empty as a politician's promises.
