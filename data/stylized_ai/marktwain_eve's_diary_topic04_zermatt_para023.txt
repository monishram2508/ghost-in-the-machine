Zermatt, you say? A village clinging to the Alps like a lovesick limpet to a rock, and as peculiar a place as ever I did see. They tell you it's all about the Matterhorn, and truth be told, that hulking brute of a mountain does loom large in the proceedings. Stands there, all craggy and imposing, like a stern uncle disapproving of the general frivolity. But I maintain the true marvel of Zermatt is not the mountain itself, but the utter lack of the infernal combustion engine! Imagine, if you will, a place where the only vehicles permitted are electric buggies, silent as specters and driven by men who seem perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown from all the dodging about of tourists. It's like a child's toy town brought to life, only instead of painted wood, it's all swanky chalets and shops selling watches that cost more than my entire wardrobe, including the moth-eaten waistcoat I'm particularly fond of.

And the tourists! Oh, the tourists! A veritable Noah's Ark of nationalities, all decked out in the latest ski gear, even if the only skiing they've done is falling face-first into a snowdrift. They stroll about, blinking in the crisp, alpine air, looking utterly bewildered by the sheer magnificence of it all. One can't help but feel a twinge of pity, really. They’ve come all this way to be awed, and by Jove, they are determined to be awed, even if it kills them (or at least results in a severe case of sunburn). The restaurants, of course, are overflowing with fondue and schnitzel, and the air is thick with the aroma of melted cheese and the low hum of polite conversation, occasionally punctuated by the shriek of a child who's just discovered that their new, ridiculously expensive snow boots are, in fact, quite waterproof. It’s a spectacle, I tell you, a grand, ridiculous, and undeniably charming spectacle. One almost expects a brass band to strike up a jaunty tune at any moment, just to underscore the sheer absurdity of it all. Almost.
