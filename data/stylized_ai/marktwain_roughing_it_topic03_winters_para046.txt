Winter, bless its frosted whiskers, is a character of no small peculiarity in these here parts. Some folks claim to enjoy it, and I reckon that's their business, though I wouldn't trade places with 'em for a gold mine the size of Pike's Peak. It arrives, subtle as a runaway mule cart, first with a breath of suspicion in the wind, a hint of frost that makes you think maybe you just imagined it. Then, BAM! It's descended upon you like a carpetbagger with a phony claim to a silver lode. The sun, that old reliable scoundrel, decides to take an extended vacation, leaving you to huddle 'round a stove that eats wood faster than a politician eats promises.

The landscape, once a riot of color and verdant growth, transforms into a monochrome study in shades of white and gray, resembling a badly developed photograph left out in the snow too long. And the cold! Lord, the cold! It'll seep into your bones like gossip into a ladies' tea party, no matter how many layers of wool you pile on. You could wear a bearskin coat stuffed with hot bricks and still feel like you're hugging an iceberg.

Now, I've heard tell that the snow is beautiful, poetic even. Maybe so, but I find it mostly inconvenient. It's pretty to look at, sure, until you're shoveling it off your roof before the whole contraption collapses under the weight, or struggling through knee-deep drifts just to fetch a bucket of water that's probably frozen solid anyway. And then there's the wildlife, or what's left of it. The squirrels, those bushy-tailed bandits, disappear like debtors fleeing a sheriff, only to reappear in the spring, hungrier and more brazen than ever. The birds, smart enough to know a bad deal when they see one, head south, leaving you to contemplate the philosophical implications of bird migration over a cup of lukewarm coffee. Winter, indeed. A grand spectacle of inconvenience, punctuated by the occasional blinding blizzard and the ever-present threat of frostbite. A time, I tell you, best endured with a healthy supply of whiskey and a good tall tale or two.
