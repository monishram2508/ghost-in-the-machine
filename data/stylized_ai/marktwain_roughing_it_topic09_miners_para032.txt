Them miners, now there's a breed for ya. A feller could write a book, and likely someone has, filled with the strange ways and stranger luck of 'em, and still not scratch the surface of the subject. You see 'em comin' into town after a spell in the diggin's, lookin' like they wrestled a chimney sweep and lost. Blackened faces, eyes peekin' out like a badger in a coal bin, and a thirst that could drain the Truckee dry. They swagger in, pockets jinglin' like a mule decked out in sleigh bells if they hit pay dirt, or draggin' their feet like they're pullin' the whole blasted mountain behind 'em if they didn't.

You could tell the old timers from the greenhorns, too. The old hands, they'd spend their dust judicious-like, maybe a new shirt, a shave at the barber, and a strategic game or two of poker. They knew the gold fever was a fickle thing, and the vein could run dry quicker than a politician's promise. The newcomers, well, they were prone to blow the whole shebang on whiskey, faro, and fancy women faster than you could say "Eureka!" Figured they'd just mosey back to the claim and dig up another fortune tomorrow. Bless their naive hearts. 

And Lord love 'em for their stories, eh? Every miner had a tale, and most of 'em stretched the truth farther than a prospector's patience. They’d swear they saw nuggets the size of hens' eggs, or chased a grizzly bear out of their claim with nothin' but a pickaxe and a curse word louder than a dynamite blast. Doubtless half of it was poppycock, but it was entertaining poppycock, and that's what mattered when you were sitting around a campfire, sippin' strong coffee under a blanket of stars thicker than buckshot. Yes sir, miners. A curious, cussed, and often comical lot, but they were the engine that kept this boomtown chuggin' along. They were the reason we were all here, chasin' that elusive golden dream. Whether they found it or not, well, that's a tale for another day.
