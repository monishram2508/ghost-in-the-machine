Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, emerged in the United States during the 19th century. Its founder, Joseph Smith, claimed to have received divine revelations, including the Book of Mormon, which members believe to be a companion scripture to the Bible. This foundational text narrates the story of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. Central to Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, suggesting that God still communicates with humanity through prophets in modern times. This belief sets them apart from many other Christian denominations who primarily focus on the Bible. Early in the church's history, Mormon practices, particularly the doctrine of plural marriage, met with significant opposition, leading to persecution and displacement of its members. This resulted in the famous trek west, culminating in the establishment of Salt Lake City, Utah, as their headquarters. Today, the church maintains a hierarchical structure, led by a president and apostles, and emphasizes missionary work, family values, and community involvement. Mormon theology includes unique doctrines, such as the belief in a pre-mortal existence, the potential for humans to become like God, and temple rituals believed to unite families eternally. They practice baptism by immersion and observe the Word of Wisdom, a health code that prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and certain other substances. The church's global presence has grown substantially, with millions of members worldwide actively involved in various religious and humanitarian endeavors. Mormons also engage in extensive genealogical research, driven by their belief in proxy baptism for deceased ancestors, further solidifying the importance of family history and ancestral connection within their faith. Despite historical controversies and theological differences, Mormonism has evolved into a prominent and increasingly influential religious organization.
