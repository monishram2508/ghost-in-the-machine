Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked souls, are a breed apart, a spectacle worthy of a dime novel, or perhaps a slightly mildewed travelogue. Imagine, if you will, a fellow clad in more drapery than your average parlor curtain, clinging to the back of a camel that looks perpetually disgruntled – a beast, mind you, whose breath could knock a buzzard off a cactus. These chaps, the Bedouins, they roam the desert like tumbleweeds with a purpose, a purpose that often seems to involve haggling over the price of dates with an enthusiasm that would make a New York pawnbroker blush. They'll pitch their tents in the middle of nowhere, quicker than you can say "Ozymandias," and suddenly, it’s a veritable oasis of coffee-making and storytelling, even if the nearest water source is a week's ride hence.

And the coffee, good heavens, the coffee! Bitter enough to pickle your tongue and strong enough to keep a hummingbird on its toes all night. They pass it around in tiny, thimble-sized cups, each sip a ceremony, a testament to their endurance and their apparent immunity to caffeine-induced jitters. They sit around the fire, these Bedouins, their faces etched with the stories of wind and sand, and spin yarns that would make Scheherazade herself envious. Some are true, some are probably taller than the Pyramids, and most likely, the two are hopelessly intertwined. They’ll tell you tales of Djinn and lost cities, of cunning sheiks and treacherous sandstorms, all delivered with a twinkle in their eye and a straight face that would shame a poker player. They're hospitable sorts, though, these desert wanderers; offer you a place by their fire, a swig of their dreadful coffee, and a story or two, even if you suspect they're secretly sizing up your camel for a potential trade. A shrewd bunch, these Bedouins, shrewd as desert foxes and twice as charming, in a sun-weathered, slightly ragged sort of way. One can't help but admire their tenacity, their ability to scratch a living from a land that looks as if it had been expressly designed to discourage life itself.
