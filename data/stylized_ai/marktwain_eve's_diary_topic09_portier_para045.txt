Now, about this portier, this…drapery of the doorway. One might think it a simple enough invention, meant to block a draft or perhaps offer a modicum of privacy, but law, don't let its unassuming presence fool you. It's a veritable Pandora's box of societal observations, that thing is. You see, the portier, unlike a proper door, is all compromise. It suggests enclosure, but offers only illusion. It whispers secrets, but shouts its flimsy nature to the world. A door says, "Stay out," or "Come in," with admirable decisiveness. But the portier? It's more like a politician, waffling between positions, hoping to offend no one, achieving only a state of perpetual, uncertain swaying.

I’ve observed folks, you see, approaching these portiers with a fascinating array of hesitations and contortions. Some sail right through, as if the very notion of an obstacle is beneath their dignity. They treat it as nothing more than a breeze, or perhaps a slightly grumpy bumblebee to be brushed aside. Others, the timid souls, they peck at it, testing the waters with a tentative finger before daring to part the fabric. It’s like watching a skittish kitten investigating a suspicious ball of yarn. And then, bless their hearts, you have the theatrical sort, who seize upon the portier as a grand opportunity for dramatic entrance. They fling it back with a flourish, announcing their arrival as if they were royalty returning from a triumphant conquest, all for the benefit of maybe a sleepy cat and a half-eaten plate of biscuits. And, of course, there's the poor sap who walks directly into it, mistaking its gentle sway for a solid barrier. A moment of profound disappointment, that, followed by the sheepish realization that he's been bested by a glorified bedsheet. Serves him right, I say. One ought to pay attention to the world around them, or else the world, in the guise of a humble portier, is liable to give them a good thwack in the face. Just goes to show, even the simplest things can offer a window, or rather, a flimsy curtain, into the absurdities of human behavior.
