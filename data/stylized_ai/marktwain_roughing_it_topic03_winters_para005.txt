Winter in Nevada! Lord, what a spectacle – a regular jubilee of frost and frozen fancy. You might think desert and snow don’t rightly belong in the same sentence, but bless your naive heart, they’re thicker than thieves out here. The sagebrush, usually a dusty green that blends in with the general weariness of the landscape, transforms into a miniature forest of white, each twig a tiny, glittering icicle. Beautiful, it is, in a harsh sort of way, like a dance hall girl with a heart of granite. Folks say it’s romantic, but I reckon they ain’t had to break the ice in their water bucket at sunrise just to get a splash to wash the trail dust off their face.

The wind, now that's a beast entirely its own. It comes howling down from the Sierras, a banshee wail that’ll strip the paint off a saloon faster than a card shark can skin a greenhorn. It ain't a friendly breeze neither; this is the kind of wind that bites clean through your coat and chews on your bones for good measure. I've seen men – strong, God-fearing men – driven to muttering conversations with jackrabbits just to hear a friendly word, or at least something vaguely resembling one. Then there’s the cold. Not that polite, nippy cold back east, mind you. This is a cold that settles in like a squatter, refusing to budge. It chills you from the inside out, until you’re convinced your blood has turned to slush. You could build a bonfire out of dollar bills, and it still wouldn’t take the edge off. And the snow? Why, it drifts so high in some places, a man could lose his whole cabin and never know it until spring thaw, when he goes out to fetch water and trips over his roof. It’s a marvel, I tell you, a testament to nature’s peculiar sense of humor. Though, I suspect, the joke is mostly on us.
