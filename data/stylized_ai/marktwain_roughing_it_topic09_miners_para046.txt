Now, these miners, bless their hopeful hearts, were a breed apart, I tell you. Picture a fella, face permanently dusted with the ochre of the earth, a beard that could house a family of field mice, and eyes squinted from a lifetime of peering into the bowels of the world. They were optimists, every last one of 'em, even after spending ten years pickin' at a patch of rock that yielded nothin' but fool's gold and disappointment. You'd hear 'em whistling as they went down that shaft, a cheerful little tune that sounded suspiciously like a desperate plea to the god of fortune. Their clothes, well, they weren't clothes so much as geological records. Each stain told a story - a story of a vein promising riches, of a sudden deluge of muddy water, or maybe just a particularly disastrous attempt at cookin' beans over a campfire. 

And the language! Lord, the language. It was a potent brew of cuss words learned from mules and technical jargon that would baffle a Philadelphia lawyer. They'd be arguing about "placer deposits" one minute and then launchin' into a string of epithets worthy of a drunken sailor the next, all without batting an eye. The only thing they took more seriously than finding gold was complaining about the price of whiskey, which, naturally, they needed to find gold. You'd offer one of 'em a clean shirt and he'd look at you like you were offerin' him a plate of boiled grasshoppers. "What good's a clean shirt down there, son?" he'd ask, "Just gonna get it dirty again in five minutes. Better to save your energy for pickin' and shovelin'." They were stubborn, superstitious, and possessed of a bone-deep conviction that their luck was just about to turn. And every so often, bless their simple souls, it actually did. Then they'd celebrate with a week-long bender that left the town lookin' like a cyclone had hit it, and then go right back down into the earth, ready to do it all over again.
