Damascus, ah, Damascus! They call it the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, though I reckon Methuselah himself would be hard-pressed to verify that claim. Still, standing there, one does get the feeling that time took a wrong turn somewhere, hopped off the stagecoach, and decided to spend an extended holiday. The streets, bless their uneven hearts, are narrow, crooked little affairs, designed, I suspect, less for efficient travel and more for keeping the sun at bay and the secrets tucked deep within. You can practically feel the ghosts of sultans and carpet merchants jostling you for space, all eager to haggle over a price that likely hasn't changed much since the days when the Queen of Sheba popped in for a visit. The air itself is a heady concoction of jasmine, roasting meat, and something indefinably ancient – a musty fragrance that whispers tales of empires risen and crumbled, of silk routes and crusades, of schemes hatched in darkened courtyards and fortunes won and lost on the turn of a dice. The people, mind you, are as cunning as foxes and as hospitable as a summer day. They'll offer you tea sweeter than a love sonnet and then, with a disarming smile, try to sell you a rug that's seen more battles than General Grant. And don't even get me started on the bazaars! A veritable labyrinth of treasures and trinkets, where one can find anything from a genuine antique lamp (allegedly Aladdin's, though I remain skeptical) to a plastic trinket that sings a tune you'd rather forget. One wanders through those winding alleys, wallet twitching nervously, knowing full well one is being fleeced with charm and panache. It's a grand old game, really, and one plays it with a sense of resigned amusement, knowing that in the end, the only thing one truly possesses is the memory of being cheerfully swindled in one of the world’s most fascinating cities. Makes a fellow feel right civilized, don't you think?
