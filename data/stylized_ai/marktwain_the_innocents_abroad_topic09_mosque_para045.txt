Now, a mosque, that’s a curious edifice, ain’t it? I reckon I’ve seen a fair few in my travels, from the sun-baked lands of the Saracens, clear up to the foggy climes of some fellas in England dabbling in the Orient. And while they all claim allegiance to the same celestial landlord, they differ in their fixins more than a Mississippi steamboat differs from a dugout canoe. Some are grand, sprawling affairs, dripping with gold leaf and tile work that'd make a peacock blush, all designed to remind you of the almighty's boundless wealth. Others are as plain as an old maid’s Sunday dress, built of mud brick and good intentions, where the only luxury is a patch of shade long enough to say your prayers.

You'll find the faithful streaming in and out all hours of the day, mind you, removing their shoes with a practiced ease that puts my own clumsy fumblings to shame. Inside, it's usually a hushed sort of affair, a sea of bowed heads and murmured prayers, except maybe when a particularly rousing sermon's being delivered, then the air can crackle with fervent pronouncements about morality and such. Makes you wonder if they're all that different from a revival meeting back home, just with a different tune and a funny-looking hat. I once saw a fella, now I swear this is true, get so carried away with his oration, he started waving his prayer beads like a lasso, nearly taking out a poor, unsuspecting pigeon perched on the minaret. And of course, no mosque is complete without a minaret, that tall, pointy stick they use to call the faithful to prayer five times a day. A fella could set his watch by it, if'n he knew how to read one, that is. A curious thing, really, this whole business of faith and prayer. Folks seem to find a lot of comfort in it, and I ain't one to knock what gets a body through the night, though I must confess, I’ve always preferred a good cigar and a stiff drink myself.
