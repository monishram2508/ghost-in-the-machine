Now, Damascus, that ancient hussy of a city, they say she's been kissed by the sun for nigh on five thousand years. Five thousand years! Makes a body feel like a mere mayfly, fluttering about for a day before the cat gets ye. Why, that city’s seen empires rise and crumble like week-old baklava, each one leaving a smudge of its flavor upon her wrinkled face. I reckon Methuselah himself probably strolled through her bazaars, haggling over a handful of dates, and complaining about the heat. And those bazaars! A veritable labyrinth of wonders and outright swindles, mind you. You can find anything from a genuine antique scarab that probably fell out of Tutankhamun’s pocket to a singing camel made entirely of bottle caps. The trick, you see, is to distinguish the two.

And the people! Lord have mercy, a more wily, shrewd, and hospitable bunch you’d be hard-pressed to unearth this side of the river Styx. They’ll charm the trousers right off your legs, then offer you a cup of rosewater-infused coffee as they admire your newfound modesty. They speak in riddles, negotiate with gestures, and understand the price of everything and the value of nothing, except perhaps a good, long nap in the shade. You can spend a week just listening to the tall tales told in the coffee houses, each one more fantastical than the last, involving genies, flying carpets, and sultans with a penchant for pet monkeys that recite poetry. I daresay half of them are outright lies, but darned if they ain’t entertaining. And as for the food, why, they could tempt a saint into gluttony with their kebabs and their sweets, swimming in honey and pistachios. A man could grow fat and happy just inhaling the aroma of Damascus, though I wouldn't recommend trying it, lest you sprout roots and become a permanent fixture of the city's already crowded landscape. Yes sir, Damascus, she's a city of contradictions, a grand old dame with secrets whispered in every breeze and a glint of mischief in her ancient eyes. A place that'll leave you both bewildered and utterly charmed, and wondering whether you’ve been robbed blind or blessed beyond measure. Probably both, if you ask me.
