Harris, bless his earnest, well-meaning heart, is the kind of fellow who’d set out to dig a well and end up inventing a new species of gopher. He's got that admirable quality of being profoundly, stubbornly wrong about nearly everything, a trait I find endlessly entertaining, though I daresay it occasionally drives the more sensible folk to distraction. Just the other day, he was explaining to me, with the gravity of a seasoned geologist, how the moon was in fact made of particularly dense cheese. He cited the craters as proof – “Clearly, Eve, those are bite marks of the celestial mice, nibbling away at the cheddar sphere!” he declared, puffing out his chest with the conviction of a man who'd just discovered America. I attempted to gently suggest the possibility of meteors, or volcanic activity, or even, for pity’s sake, plain old scientific consensus, but it was like trying to reason with a brick wall made of Limburger. He simply harrumphed, adjusted his spectacles, and doubled down on his cheesy hypothesis.

And his inventions! Oh, Lord, the inventions. He’s forever tinkering in his shed, producing contraptions of such magnificent impracticality that they’d make even Leonardo da Vinci blush with embarrassment. His latest masterpiece is a self-buttering pancake machine, which, in theory, sounds like a boon to civilized society. However, in practice, it involves a complex system of pulleys, levers, and a very confused chicken whose sole purpose seems to be scattering feathers and flapping in a manner that suggests imminent cardiac arrest. The first, and only, pancake it produced ended up plastered to the ceiling, coated in more chicken down than butter, and smelling faintly of ammonia. Harris, of course, considered it a resounding success, merely requiring “a few minor adjustments.” I shudder to think what those adjustments might entail. He's a walking testament to the idea that enthusiasm, when divorced from even the slightest acquaintance with common sense, is a force more powerful, and considerably more chaotic, than any natural disaster. Still, one can’t help but admire his persistence, even if one also harbors a deep-seated fear of what he’ll invent next.
