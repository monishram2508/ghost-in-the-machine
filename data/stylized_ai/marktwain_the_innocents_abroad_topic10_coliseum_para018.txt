Now, about this Coliseum, this grand old ruin in Rome, a place that whispers of emperors and gladiators, lions and such. They tell you it was built for spectacles, for the amusement of the Roman populace, a right proper circus maximus, only shaped like an egg-less donut. And I reckon that's true, in a way. Folks do love a bit of bloody entertainment, be it a dog fight behind the saloon or a king being dethroned. Human nature, I suppose, hasn't changed much since the days of Julius Caesar and his salad.

The scale of the thing is something to behold, mind you. Imagine a building big enough to house a good-sized town, all packed in tiers, eager to see some chap get his head lopped off by a burly fellow with a net and a trident. They say it held fifty thousand souls, all cheering and jeering, a veritable beehive of bloodlust. And for what? A bit of sport? A momentary distraction from the troubles of everyday life? It seems a rather expensive and messy way to forget you're paying too much for your wine.

They say it used to be covered in marble, all shiny and new, a testament to Roman grandeur. Now, it's mostly just brick and crumbling stone, looking like a giant had taken a bite out of it. Time, she's a cruel mistress, ain't she? She wears down even the mightiest empires, leaving behind only these skeletal remains, these husks of former glory. Still, you can’t help but admire the audacity of it all. To build such a monstrous thing, purely for the purpose of staging public executions and animal hunts! It speaks to a certain confidence, a certain… well, a certain barbarity that is both terrifying and strangely fascinating. Makes you wonder what spectacles we’re building today, and what future generations will think of our own particular brand of crazy. Perhaps they'll be staring at the ruins of a giant television screen, wondering what in tarnation a "reality show" could have been. Lord have mercy on their souls if that’s the case.
