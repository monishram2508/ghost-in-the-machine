Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked hides, are a spectacle worth more than a camel loaded with rubies, I assure you. Imagine a fellow, lean as a desert wind and tougher than a week-old date, draped in a robe that's seen more sandstorms than hairs on my head, riding a beast that seems to think it owns the whole darn desert. They call it ‘loyalty,’ I call it good sense on the camel’s part, considering the alternative is likely becoming buzzard bait. They wander about this immense, godforsaken sandbox, these Bedouins, like ants on a picnic blanket the Almighty forgot to shake out. They seem to know every grain of sand, every wisp of a hidden water source, better than I know the number of whiskers on a walrus. Their tents, woven from goat hair darker than a preacher’s mood after a bad sermon, appear suddenly and disappear even faster, like a gambler’s fortune after a game of faro with a Mississippi riverboat hustler.

They trade in dates, goats, and secrets, mind you – secrets whispered around the crackling campfire, secrets dark and mysterious as a politician’s promises. They tell tales, too, these fellows, tales of djinn and ancient kings, of oases shimmering like mirages and warriors fierce enough to scare the very stars out of the sky. Whether there's truth to 'em, well, that's a question best left unanswered, like whether a cat prefers being tossed into a well or being left alone. One thing’s certain, though, they’re a self-sufficient bunch, these Bedouins. They need not your railroads, your telegraphs, nor your fancy imported biscuits. Just give 'em the sun, a camel, and a patch of sand, and they're happier than a pig in, well, you know. They’ll survive you, too, I reckon, long after your empires crumble and your skyscrapers are turned into sand castles for future generations of desert lizards. They’re the desert’s backbone, these Bedouins, as enduring and unfathomable as the desert itself. And that, my friend, is saying something indeed.
