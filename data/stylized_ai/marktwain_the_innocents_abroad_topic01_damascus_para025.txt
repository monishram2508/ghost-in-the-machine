Now, Damascus. A city old as Methuselah’s beard, and just as likely to tell you a tall tale. They call it the "City of Jasmine," which sounds charming, don't it? Like a perfume advertisement gone mad. But let me tell you, that jasmine’s probably seen more battles than blossoms in its long and checkered career. They boast of it being the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, which is a bit like bragging about having the oldest continuously leaky faucet in your kitchen. Impressive, perhaps, to a plumber, but less so to a fellow trying to enjoy a decent cup of coffee.

I wandered its streets, a labyrinth designed, I suspect, by a committee of spiteful genies. Every corner held a surprise, usually involving a donkey cart loaded precariously high with something that looked vaguely edible and smelled distinctly not. The merchants, bless their persuasive souls, could talk a bishop into buying a fez. Each spice, each silk scarf, each tarnished trinket came with a history, a lineage, and a price that miraculously doubled the moment I showed the slightest interest. You’d think I was made of money, judging by their enthusiasm. Or maybe just easily duped, which, upon reflection, is probably closer to the truth.

I saw the Great Mosque, a magnificent edifice, truly. A testament to faith, artistry, and an impressive collection of pigeons. The pigeons, I might add, seemed to have an almost proprietary interest in the place, leaving their mark, shall we say, with the casual abandon only generations of unchallenged occupancy can foster. And then there were the cafes, filled with men puffing on hookahs, sipping coffee so strong it could raise the dead, and arguing with the fervor of lawyers debating the merits of Original Sin. A lively bunch, those Damascenes, though I couldn't decipher a lick of what they were arguing about. Probably politics, or the price of dates, or perhaps the eternal mystery of why Western tourists insist on wearing socks with sandals. Who can say? It's all part of the damascus mystique, a swirling blend of ancient history, modern hustle, and a pervasive scent of something faintly floral and undeniably donkey.
