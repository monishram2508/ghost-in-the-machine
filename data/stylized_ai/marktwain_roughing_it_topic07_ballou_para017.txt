Ballou, now there was a specimen. A tenderfoot so green you could use him for pickling, fresh off the boat from back East where, I reckon, they figured a man with a shovel was still a novelty. Claimed he was a lawyer, did Ballou, though his arguments sounded more like a cat fight in a tin shop than any legal wrangling I’d ever witnessed. He possessed a naiveté so profound it could make a seasoned mule skinner weep with pity. He arrived in Carson City armed with a carpetbag full of Eastern notions and a constitution so delicate a stiff breeze threatened to knock him clean off his feet. I swear, he looked like he expected the streets to be paved with gold and the saloons to serve tea with crumpets instead of rotgut whiskey that could peel the paint off a pine coffin.

Everything was a wonder to him, from the dusty sagebrush that scratched at his ankles to the grizzled miners spitting tobacco juice with alarming accuracy. He’d ask questions like a pup chasing its tail, never quite understanding the answers even when they were delivered plain enough for a jackrabbit to comprehend. One time, he saw a prospector panning for gold and, bless his heart, he inquired if the man was expecting to catch a trout. The prospector, a fella named One-Eyed Pete who could scare a timber wolf with his glare, nearly choked on his chew before sputtering something about “fool’s gold” and sending Ballou scurrying away like a frightened prairie dog. He tried his hand at mining, of course, but his digging skills were about on par with a blind badger. He’d chip away at the rock with all the grace of a newborn calf on roller skates, producing more dust than precious metal. It was a sight to behold, I tell you, a city fella wrestling with the stubborn earth, convinced he’d strike it rich while the rest of us were just trying to keep from laughing ourselves silly. Poor Ballou, he was as out of place as a piano in a pigsty, but he had a heart of gold, even if it was buried deep, deep down under layers of ignorance and Eastern city slicker notions. He was a diamond in the rough, alright, though it might take a geological survey to find it.
