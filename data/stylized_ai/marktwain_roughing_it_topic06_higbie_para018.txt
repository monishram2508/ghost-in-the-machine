Higbie, now there's a specimen. Not precisely what you'd call a diamond of the first water, no sir. More like one of those quartz crystals you find laying about in a gulch, catching the sun just right so a tenderfoot mistakes it for something valuable. But Higbie, bless his simple heart, he believed he was valuable. Lord, the man had an optimism that could power a steam engine. He’d stake a claim on a patch of ground barren as a billiard ball and tell you it was plumb overflowing with gold, just waitin' for a little elbow grease and the right incantation. Never mind that three previous fools, armed with shovels and hope, had already sweated themselves half to death on that same blasted patch.

He was a cheerful sort, though, Higbie was. Always had a yarn ready, even if it was one you’d heard him spin a dozen times before. They all usually involved him outsmarting someone, generally a Chinaman or a stagecoach robber, both of whom, in his stories, were dumber than a bag of hammers. Never actually saw him outsmart anyone, mind you. In fact, seemed like more often than not, Higbie was the one being outsmarted. But he’d tell the story with such conviction, such gusto, you’d almost believe it yourself, until you remembered the facts, which, as usual, were in stark opposition to his colorful tale.

Claimed to be a lawyer back East, which I reckon he was, in the same way I’m a millionaire-- only on paper and in my dreams. He could quote the law, alright, usually at the top of his lungs after a few drinks, but I doubt he ever actually practiced it. More likely, he got chased out of town by a disgruntled client and figured the wild West was a better place to hang his shingle, a shingle that probably blew away in the first stiff breeze. All the same, Higbie was a likeable cuss. Harmless as a field mouse, persistent as a gnat, and just about as sharp. You couldn’t help but chuckle at his antics, even as you kept a close eye on your wallet. He was a true study in human nature, a walking, talking, yarn-spinning testament to the enduring power of self-delusion, and somehow, a reminder that even the most goldarned fool could find a way to make you smile.
