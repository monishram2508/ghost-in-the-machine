Carson, now there's a town that could give a buzzard indigestion just looking at it. Perched up there in the Nevada territory like a mangy crow on a fence post, it ain't much to look at, truth be told. The buildings, mostly frame shacks and brick piles struggling against the desert sun, seem to lean on each other for support, like a bunch of old drunks after a hard night at the saloon. Dust, that's the main ingredient in Carson, finer than flour and twice as pervasive. It coats everything, from the whiskers of the gentlemen passing by to the already questionable pies sitting in the window of Mrs. McGuffey's bakery. Speaking of gentlemen, most of 'em are either prospectors, miners, or lawyers, three species only slightly less rapacious than a swarm of locusts. You can tell 'em apart by the size of their claims, the depth of their mine shafts, and the length of their legal briefs, respectively. The women, bless their persevering souls, try to bring a touch of civilization to the place, but it's a hard fight against the relentless grit and the general lawlessness that permeates the very air. I saw one lady trying to cultivate roses in her front yard, bless her heart. They looked about as happy as a politician facing a pay cut. And the sunsets! Well, they're alright, I suppose. Pretty colors and all, but even they’re a tad dramatic, like the town itself is trying too hard to make a good impression. You'd think with all the silver coming out of the surrounding hills, Carson would be a bit more refined, a bit more… shall we say, *genteel*? But no, it's still rough around the edges, like a diamond straight from the mine. Maybe one day it'll polish up nice and proper, but I wouldn't bet my last dollar on it. For now, it's just Carson, a dusty, bustling, exasperating, and thoroughly unforgettable piece of the Wild West.
