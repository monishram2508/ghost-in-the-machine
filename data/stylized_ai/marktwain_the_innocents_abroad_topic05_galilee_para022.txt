Now, Galilee, bless its heart, ain't what you'd call the Garden of Eden, though some folks might argue otherwise, particularly the ones selling you fish on the lake. The Sea of Galilee, that is, a body of water so modest, you'd be forgiven for mistaking it for a particularly ambitious puddle. They call it a "sea," mind you, which is a bit like calling a flea a bison – a touch of exaggeration for the tourist trade, I suspect. Still, it's got a certain charm, I'll grant you, if you're partial to a good bit of blue reflecting off rocky hills and a persistent breeze that threatens to carry your hat clean into the Jordan.

The land itself is a study in brown and green, mostly brown, and dotted with villages that appear to have been constructed by a committee of indecisive architects who couldn't quite agree on a building material or a color scheme. You'll see the odd donkey wandering about, looking for all the world like it's misplaced its owner and contemplating the futility of existence, which, frankly, is a mood easily shared by the weary traveler after a day spent haggling for trinkets and dodging aggressive souvenir peddlers. 

But, and there's always a "but," Galilee has got a history, thick as the mud on your boots after a rain. They say Jesus traipsed around these parts, performing miracles and whatnot. I can't vouch for the miracles, mind you, but I can vouch for the fact that folks have been making a pretty good living selling "genuine" relics and "authentic" pieces of the true cross ever since. And the sunsets? Well, even a hardened cynic like myself has to admit, they're something special. They paint the sky in shades of orange and purple that would make a peacock blush, and for a fleeting moment, you might just forget you're surrounded by overpriced shawarma and the persistent bleating of sheep. So, Galilee, it's not exactly a slice of heaven, but it’s got enough character to keep things interesting, even if that character is largely derived from centuries of relentless marketing.
