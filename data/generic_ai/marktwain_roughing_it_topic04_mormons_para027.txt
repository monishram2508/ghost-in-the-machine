The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian faith founded by Joseph Smith in the United States during the 19th century. Mormons believe that Smith translated the Book of Mormon, a sacred text believed to be divinely revealed, which recounts the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas and complements the Bible. Central to Mormon theology is the belief in continuing revelation, meaning that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets, just as he did in biblical times. This doctrine sets them apart from many other Christian denominations that believe revelation ceased with the early apostles. Mormons emphasize the importance of family, eternal marriage, and temple worship. Temples are considered houses of the Lord, where sacred ordinances such as baptisms for the dead and eternal sealings are performed. The church promotes a high standard of moral conduct, including adherence to the Word of Wisdom, a health code that prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs, and excessive caffeine consumption. Missionary service is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving missions for up to two years, proselytizing and performing service throughout the world. Latter-day Saints have a strong sense of community and mutual support, which is fostered through various church programs and activities. The Church is structured hierarchically, with lay members holding leadership positions at the local level, overseen by regional and general authorities. While the Church has faced historical controversies, including its past practice of polygamy, it is now a global organization with millions of members worldwide, actively involved in humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, and community outreach programs. The faith encourages personal piety, education, and service to others, striving to live according to the teachings of Jesus Christ as they understand them through scripture and ongoing revelation. The Mormon worldview is characterized by a unique cosmology, emphasizing the eternal nature of spirits and the potential for human progression towards godhood.
