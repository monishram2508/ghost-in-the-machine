Now, concerning these mosques, these edifices dedicated to the worship of, well, Him, the Almighty—a rather curious institution, when you stop to ponder on it. I’ve seen a goodly number in my travels, from the grandest, adorned with domes that bulge towards the heavens like ambitious gourds, to the humblest, tucked away in some dusty corner of a town like a forgotten promise. And I must say, there’s a certain theatricality to the whole affair, a solemn performance played out five times a day. The call to prayer, that sonorous, almost hypnotic chant booming from the minarets, can rattle the very teeth in your head, though I suspect it’s more likely to rouse the lazy lizards basking in the sun.

Then there's the business of ablutions, the washing of hands and feet and, if you’ll pardon the expression, other bits and pieces, before entering. It seems an awful lot of scrubbing for spiritual enlightenment, wouldn't you say? One might think cleanliness is next to godliness, but that doesn't mean godliness demands you spend half the day in the washroom. And once inside, it's a sea of bowed heads and murmuring prayers, a democratic demonstration of devotion, where even the richest potentate must kneel alongside the humblest beggar. Quite a sight, really, seeing a fellow who probably holds the lives of thousands in his palm suddenly reduced to humble supplication. Of course, one can’t help but wonder if some of them are really thinking about their business deals or that unpaid debt. Human nature, I suppose, doesn't take a holiday just because you’ve stepped into a holy place. But all in all, these mosques are interesting buildings, often with beautiful tilework and impressive arches, offering a respite from the world outside, whether one seeks solace in prayer or merely a cool spot to escape the midday sun, and a place that, though born of devotion, sometimes reminds one that even spirituality has its share of theatrical presentation and human complexity.
