Gibraltar, bless its soul, is a sight most peculiar, a rock sticking out of the sea like a dog’s hind leg, begging for a scratch. One can’t help but marvel, though, at the sheer audacity of the place. Here it sits, a lump of limestone swiped from the coast of Africa, clinging stubbornly to the southernmost tip of Spain, whilst declaring itself, with a straight face, to be British. It’s a geographical conundrum, a political pickle, and quite frankly, a source of endless amusement to a traveling fellow such as myself. One arrives by sea, and is immediately beset upon by small boats, filled with chattering souls hawking tours of the caverns, and promises of apes swinging from one's hat. Said apes, the Barbary macaques, are indeed present, and possess a boldness that would put a London pickpocket to shame. They are, in short, furry brigands, forever on the lookout for unattended biscuits and shiny trinkets. I witnessed one brazen fellow attempting to abscond with a lady’s spectacles, a feat he accomplished with a speed that would make a seasoned magician envious.

The town itself is a delightful hodgepodge, a jumble of British pubs serving fish and chips, cheek-by-jowl with Spanish bodegas offering tapas and sherry. The accents are a confounding mix of cockney, Andalusian, and something altogether unique, a linguistic stew that leaves one utterly bewildered yet strangely charmed. One can wander through the streets, dodging darting scooters and the occasional military vehicle, all the while contemplating the sheer unlikeliness of the place. Imagine, if you will, a bit of London dropped haphazardly onto the Mediterranean, seasoned with a dash of Spanish flair, and inhabited by a troop of thieving primates. The overall experience leaves one feeling rather like one has stumbled into a particularly vivid and improbable dream, a dream best enjoyed with a pint of ale and a healthy sense of the absurd. And mind your spectacles, lest a cheeky ape decide they’d look better perched upon his simian nose.
