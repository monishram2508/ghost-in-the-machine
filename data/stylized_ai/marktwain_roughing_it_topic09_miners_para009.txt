Them miners, now there's a breed apart, ain't they? Like a badger crossed with a groundhog and a whole lotta stubborn grit. You'd see 'em comin' into town, dust clinging to 'em thicker than lies to a politician, clothes lookin' like they'd wrestled a mountain lion and lost. But Lord, they had that gleam in their eye, the one that says, "Gold's waitin' for me, and I'm just the fool stubborn enough to dig it out." Some claimed they were lookin' for fortune, but I reckon most were lookin' to outsmart the next feller.

They’d strut into the saloons, these gents, all swagger and false bravado, throwin' down a poke of dust like it was nothin', buyin' drinks for the whole damn place. Of course, half of 'em were dead broke by the next mornin', havin' traded their find for rotgut whiskey and tall tales. You couldn't tell if they were lyin' or not, 'cause they believed their own hogwash better than the preacher believed in sin. They’d talk about strikes and claims like they were discussin' the weather, all casual-like, but keep an eye on their hands, twitchin' with the want to grab yours if you looked too interested.

And the names! Good Lord, the names! "Whiskey Pete," "One-Eyed Jack," "Stuttering Joe." You couldn’t invent characters like that if you tried. Each one had a story wilder than the last, usually involving a runaway mule, a grizzly bear, and a near-death experience in a flooded mine. Whether they were tellin' the truth was a matter of perspective, I suppose. Maybe they’d seen somethin' down in the dark that scrambled their brains a little, made 'em see ghosts in the quartz and angels in the fool's gold. Whatever it was, they kept diggin', kept hopin', kept chasin' that glint of yellow that promised riches and a ticket out. And just when you thought they were the dumbest, most gullible creatures on God's green earth, one of 'em would actually strike it rich. Then you'd just shake your head and think, "Well, I'll be hornswoggled."
