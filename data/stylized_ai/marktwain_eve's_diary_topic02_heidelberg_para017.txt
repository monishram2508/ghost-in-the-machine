Heidelberg, they call it, a town clinging to the Neckar like a lovesick maiden to a particularly imposing crag. And imposing it is, this crag, crowned with the ruin of a castle that would make a Roman emperor blush with its ambitions. Now, ruins are all well and good, providing a certain picturesque melancholy for poets and painters to moon over, but let me tell you, climbing to see them is another matter entirely. One puffing and panting, clutching at handholds worn smooth by generations of tourists seeking a glimpse of romantic decay. Speaking of tourists, why, they’re as thick as flies on a butcher's shop counter. Each one armed with a camera the size of a small dog and determined to capture the very soul of this charming old place, though I daresay, most of them end up with a picture of their spouse grimacing into the sunlight. The university, bless its ancient heart, seems to be breeding a whole new race of bespectacled students, perpetually hunched over books denser than lead and spouting phrases in a language so learned it’s practically invisible to the naked ear. They haunt the old bridge like philosophical ghosts, debating the finer points of existence with a fervor that would make a church deacon weep. And then there's the Great Vat, a wine cask of such monstrous proportions that it could, without exaggeration, swallow a small cottage whole. Apparently, it was intended to hold the city's tithe of wine, though I suspect most of it found its way down the throats of the town council long before it ever reached the Vat's thirsty maw. One shudders to think of the hangover. All in all, Heidelberg is a place of quaint contradictions: a noble ruin that demands you suffer for its beauty; a throng of tourists seeking solitude; and a wine vat so large, it’s almost comically useless. A bit like life, I suppose, when you stop to think about it.
