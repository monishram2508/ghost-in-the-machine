Slade! Now there was a name that could curdle milk and send decent folk scurrying for cover faster than a prairie fire. He kept that station out near the junction, a ramshackle affair that looked like it had been assembled by a drunk carpenter using leftover bits from Noah’s Ark. Slade himself was a specimen, I tell you, a walking advertisement for the evils of strong liquor and loose living. He was built like a blacksmith, thick-necked and broad-shouldered, but carried himself with a slouch that suggested he’d spent more time brawling than blacksmithing. His eyes, small and beady, were the kind that looked right through you, sizing up your worth like a butcher eyeing a prize steer. He was a quiet man, mostly, until he wasn't. And when Slade wasn't quiet, Lord have mercy on your soul.

I’d heard tales aplenty, enough to fill a book thicker than Webster’s Dictionary. Stories of shootouts and knifings, of men buried shallow in unmarked graves out behind the station, all whispers and rumors, of course, but smelling strongly of gunpowder and cheap whiskey. Some said he’d once been a respectable citizen, even a lawman, but the West, she has a way of corrupting the best of us, and Slade, well, he succumbed quicker than a Mormon to a free buffet. He had this habit, see, of collecting watches, taking them off men he’d… *disagreed* with. Wore them all, too, strapped up and down his arms like some gaudy, ticking armor. Must’ve been heavy enough to knock a man down in a good breeze. I reckon telling time around Slade was like trying to decipher a flock of crows arguing about corn – loud, confusing, and ultimately pointless. Despite all this, mind you, he kept the station running, more or less. The stage coaches came through, the mail got delivered, and folks mostly managed to survive their encounters with the man, though I suspect many breathed a sigh of relief when they were well past the station and headed off to safer territories.
