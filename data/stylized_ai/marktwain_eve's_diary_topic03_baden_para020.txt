Baden-Baden, they call it. Baden twice, no less, in case the dullard hadn't grasped the first iteration. As if shouting its bathing propensities louder might somehow improve them. I tell you, a town so fixated on cleanliness does breed suspicion in my book. One wonders what manner of grime it seeks so vehemently to obliterate. Surely, no town could be naturally that pure. I confess, I did partake in the supposed curative waters, albeit with a nose pinched tighter than a miser's purse. The experience was akin to simmering oneself gently in lukewarm broth, attended by stout, aproned women who seemed perpetually amused at the whole charade. Amused, I suspect, because they know full well the water has about as much healing power as a politician's promise. Still, the ladies of leisure flocked there, draped in more lace and feathers than a barnyard rooster, all convinced they were dissolving their humours and tightening their complexions. Bless their hearts. It’s a harmless enough delusion, I suppose, and does keep the milliners in business. The town itself, prettified beyond all recognition, resembled nothing so much as a confectioner’s nightmare: endless rows of meticulously trimmed hedges, flowerbeds bursting with blooms in colours so flamboyant they'd make a peacock blush, and buildings so freshly painted they practically gleamed. One could practically taste the money dripping from the eaves. And the shops! Oh, the shops! Filled with baubles and trinkets that would bankrupt a Roman emperor in a fortnight. I spied a cuckoo clock, embellished with enough gold leaf to gild a cathedral, for the price of a respectable farm. Who buys such nonsense? Apparently, plenty. Baden-Baden is a town that caters to a very specific breed: the terminally bored and exceedingly wealthy. It is, in essence, a playground for grown-ups with too much time, and far too much money, on their hands.
