Brigham, now there was a sight to behold – a man who could lead a flock of sheep across the desert and convince them it was the promised land, all while somehow turning a tidy profit in the sheep-shearing business on the side. I reckon he was built like a granite mountain, that man was, with a voice that boomed like a runaway ore cart echoing through Echo Canyon. He had that glint in his eye, too, the kind that said he knew more than he was lettin’ on, which in this life usually means he’s got a secret stash of somethin’ valuable, be it gold nuggets or particularly fine tobacco. He could preach fire and brimstone one minute, paintin’ pictures of the eternal damnation that awaited the heathen, and then next he’d be chawin’ on a plug of tobacco and crackin’ a dry joke about the latest polygamy scandal, leaving you to wonder if the man was a prophet or a politician, or maybe just a shrewd businessman in disguise.

He surrounded himself with a retinue of wives that would make Solomon blush, each one a testament to his… well, let's just call it "persuasion," and built a city with more temples and tabernacles than saloons, which in this territory, takes some doin’. Salt Lake City itself was a curious affair, all grid-like and proper, a veritable oasis of sobriety smack dab in the middle of a landscape that seemed designed to drive a man to drink. It was a testament to Brigham’s iron will, that city, a stubborn refusal to let the desert win. He had that knack for inspiring loyalty, too, though whether it was fear of God, fear of Brigham, or just plain desperation for a slice of irrigated land, I couldn’t rightly say. But whatever it was, it worked. He ruled that roost with a hand so firm you could sharpen a knife on it, and he did it all with a straight face and a vocabulary that could quote scripture and cuss out a mule driver with equal aplomb. You may not have agreed with him, mind you, but you couldn't deny the man was a force of nature, like a dust devil sweepin’ across the plains, leavin' a trail of wonder and a fair bit of chaos in its wake.
