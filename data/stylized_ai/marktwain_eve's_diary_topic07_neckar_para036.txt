The Neckar, you see, is a river that ambles along with a purpose only a German river could truly understand. It isn't grand like the Mississippi, mind you, no sir, no dramatic floods or steamboat races to boast of. It's more like a placid old gentleman, puffing a pipe and taking his sweet time getting to wherever it is he's going. Heidelberg, of course, that preposterously picturesque town clinging to its hillside like a lovesick ivy, is draped along its banks, and honestly, it’s almost a bit much, the perfection of it all. One suspects the river itself rolls its watery eyes at the tourists clicking away with their infernal contraptions, capturing the castle in every conceivable light, as if they'd discovered something new. I swear I saw a swan yawn once, contemplating the same view for the thousandth time.

And the towns that follow after, why, they're precisely what one expects: neat as a pin, with gabled houses and flower boxes overflowing with geraniums. You could practically set your watch by the ringing of the church bells, a monotonous precision that both soothes and grates upon the nerves. I once attempted to learn a German folk song about the Neckar, but gave it up after the third verse; they’re alarmingly fond of repetition, these Germans. It's said the river once carried logs down to the Rhine, a truly laborious business that probably involved more beer than actual work. Now it's mostly pleasure boats, filled with families enjoying the sunshine and consuming alarming quantities of sausages. I, myself, have been known to partake in said sausages, so who am I to judge? The Neckar, in all its tranquil predictability, is a fine river, yes. A fine river to sit beside, sip a respectable Riesling, and contemplate the utter and complete absurdity of it all. Especially when the locals are singing off-key.
