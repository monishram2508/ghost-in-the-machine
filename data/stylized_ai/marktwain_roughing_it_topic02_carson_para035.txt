Carson City, that little excrescence clinging to the side of the Sierra Nevada like a flea on a woolly dog, wasn’t much to look at, no sir. You wouldn't mistake it for New York, or even Virginia City on a good day. Why, I've seen prettier hog wallows after a decent rain. But there she sat, the capital of Nevada Territory, and as capitals go, she was as peculiar as a three-legged jackrabbit with a penchant for opera. The streets, wide enough to accommodate a stampeding herd of buffalo (should one ever take a wrong turn and end up that far west, a highly unlikely scenario, mind you), were mostly empty, except for a stray dog or two engaged in philosophical debates with the dust devils. The buildings, mostly made of wood and a healthy dose of optimistic hope, sported signs promising everything from "refreshments" (which generally meant watered-down whiskey) to "legal advice" (from someone who probably learned the law from a dime novel). 

The air itself seemed to hang heavy with the scent of sagebrush and disappointed dreams. You could practically taste the failed silver prospects and broken promises on the breeze. The people? A motley crew, to be sure. You had your prospectors, grizzled and sun-baked, still clinging to the belief that tomorrow would bring the big strike. Then you had the lawyers, smoother than a greased pig, always ready to capitalize on someone else’s misfortune. And, of course, the politicians, who were, well, politicians. They promised the moon and the stars, and delivered, generally, hot air and higher taxes. But even with all its shortcomings, that little speck of a city had a certain charm, a rugged, untamed spirit that mirrored the land around it. Like a homely mule with a heart of gold, Carson wasn’t pretty, but she was…honest, in her own peculiar way. And in a territory overflowing with charlatans and dreamers, that counted for something, by thunder.
