Now, about this glacier business. Adam, bless his simple heart, he took one look at this monstrous, icy behemoth slouching down from the mountains like a drowsy, overweight lion, and declares, “Pretty, isn’t it?” Pretty! As if a thing that could grind mountains to pebbles with nary a blink deserves such a frivolous compliment. It’s like calling a thunderstorm “slightly moist.” Honestly, the man's vocabulary hadn’t quite caught up with the Creator’s ambition.

Anyway, I poked it with a stick – a sturdy branch, mind you, not some wilting fern – and found it to be shockingly cold. Colder than the Serpent’s stare, which is saying something. This glacier, it's a slow, agonizing bully. Imagine molasses, but frozen solid and bent on world domination, inching its way through the landscape with the patience of a saint and the destructive power of a scorned woman. It doesn't hurry, oh no, it simply grinds, crunches, and reshapes everything in its path, leaving behind a trail of rubble and shattered dreams. Adam, naturally, found a smooth rock polished by the glacier and declared it “a fine seat.” He’d be comfortable, he said. He didn’t mention anything about the draft emanating from the ice that nearly froze my tailbone. Men! Always prioritizing comfort over common sense.

The glacier even had little rivers and streams running through it, like veins of icy blue coursing through a grumpy old giant. I tried to catch a fish in one of them, hoping for a bit of variety in our perpetually fruity diet, but the water was so cold, it’d probably freeze a fish solid before I could even say "dinner's ready." This glacier, it's a magnificent monstrosity, a spectacle of slow-motion destruction, and another example of the Creator’s rather… extravagant sense of humor. I suspect he’s having a grand old laugh somewhere, watching us scratch our heads and trying to make sense of it all, while simultaneously trying to find a comfortable place to sit near something that's actively attempting to revert the Earth back to the Ice Age. And Adam, bless his heart, thinks it's pretty.
