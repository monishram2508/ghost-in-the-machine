So, there I was, stuck like a fly in molasses in Salt Lake City. Never seen such a hive of industry, and piety too, I reckon. The Mormons, or Latter-day Saints, as they prefer, are a peculiar bunch, no doubt about it. They’ve got this Brigham Young fellow, a regular Moses leading his people out of the wilderness, though instead of milk and honey, he found sagebrush and hard work. Built the whole darned city from scratch, they did. One minute there’s desert, next minute there’s temples and tabernacles springing up like mushrooms after a rain. And the folks, well, they’re cleaner than a hound's tooth after a Sunday bath. Honest as the day is long, most of 'em, though I did hear tell of a few sharp-eyed traders amongst them. Can't paint the whole town with the same brush, you know.

The women, now there’s a story. Plenty of ‘em, for one thing. I’ve heard whispers of multiple wives – a whole celestial buffet of them. Brigham Young himself, they say, had more wives than hairs on a dog. Now, I ain’t one to judge a man’s domestic arrangements, but it does make for a complicated family tree, don’t you think? And the singing! Heavens to Betsy, they love to sing. Choirs big enough to fill a mountain range, belting out hymns that’ll make your fillings rattle. A fella could get religion just from the sheer volume of it. Though I reckon some folks join up just for the music, and maybe a chance to snag a nice, god-fearing wife from the choir. Can't blame 'em, really. All in all, they're a curious lot, the Mormons. A bit odd, maybe, but industrious, and polite enough, even when they're trying to convert you. Though I did draw the line at reading that Book of Mormon; seems to me I got enough trouble keeping up with the newspapers. Still, you gotta admire their pluck, their grit, and their ability to turn a desert into a garden. Whether their religion is right or wrong, well, that’s between them and the Almighty. My only concern is finding a decent saloon in this town of teetotalers. Now that’s a real challenge.
