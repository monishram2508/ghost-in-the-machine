Now, Galilee. They call it Galilee of the Gentiles, and a more Gentile-ish place I haven't clapped eyes on in my travels, barring perhaps, a bustling saloon in Virginia City after a silver strike. You expect to find throngs of pilgrims, pious souls clutching rosaries and mumbling scriptures, but instead, you're more likely to stumble upon a gaggle of sunburnt tourists haggling for olive wood carvings, or a donkey wearing a straw hat, presumably pondering the indignity of its current employment. The Sea of Galilee, bless its tranquil surface, is a lake, pure and simple, though I reckon naming it 'Sea' lends it a certain grandeur, a touch of the theatrical, like calling a particularly robust chicken a 'fowl of majesty.'

The land itself, though, holds a peculiar charm. Not the dramatic grandeur of the Alps, mind you, but a quiet, unassuming beauty. The hills, all rounded and gentle like a kindly old aunt's bosom, are draped in olive groves and fig orchards, a patchwork quilt of green and grey under the merciless Levantine sun. I’ve seen olive trees that looked older than Methuselah, gnarled and twisted, bearing silent witness to the centuries rolling past. One almost expects them to start dispensing sage advice, or at the very least, a decent recipe for tapenade. As for the villages dotted across the landscape, well, they're as humble as a preacher's Sunday suit, but cozy enough in their own way. Houses huddled together, like sheep sheltering from a storm, their walls painted in shades of white and ochre that seem to absorb the very sunlight itself. One might be tempted to romanticize it all, to wax lyrical about the simple life and the rustic charm, but then you trip over a stray chicken, get swarmed by flies, and remember that rural life, like a bad poker hand, ain't always what it's cracked up to be. Still, there's a certain peace there, a slow, deliberate rhythm that hums through the air, a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the so-called civilized world. I suspect even a hardened cynic could find a moment of quiet contemplation on those Galilean hills, provided, of course, they remembered to bring insect repellent.
