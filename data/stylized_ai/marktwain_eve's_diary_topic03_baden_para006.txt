Baden, ah Baden! That gilded cage for bored dukes and duchesses, a place where one could scarcely swing a cat without clonking a countess on the nose. It seems to me that the very air of Baden is thick with eau de cologne and the whispered scandals of titled folk. I went there, naturally, hoping to observe humanity in its most flamboyant plumage – and I was not disappointed, bless my stars! The Kursaal, a palace dedicated to the worship of Chance, shimmered like a mirage in the valley. One could spend an entire fortune – or someone else’s, preferably – trying to coax the little ball to land on a lucky number. I saw one gentleman, his face the color of overripe plums, whose fortune seemed to drain away with each spin of the roulette wheel, leaving him poorer, if perhaps wiser.

And the promenades! Good heavens, the promenades! They were practically overrun with parasols and pomaded gentlemen, all vying for the attention of ladies who looked as though they’d been poured into their silk gowns. One poor fellow, his mustache waxed to the point of rigidity, attempted to impress a particularly formidable dowager by reciting poetry. The poor soul forgot a line, and the dowager's withering stare could have curdled milk at fifty paces. I swear, it was a sight to make even a hardened cynic like myself chuckle in his beard. And of course, the baths! One entered feeling like a mere mortal, and emerged feeling like a boiled lobster, but smelling faintly of sulfur and self-importance. Indeed, Baden, with all its glitter and gaudiness, its pretense and pomp, is quite like a magnificent, over-stuffed pastry – delectable to look at, undeniably rich, and likely to give you a terrible stomach ache if you indulge too freely. It is a perfect place for those who can afford the indigestion, and amusing, certainly, to those who merely observe the feasting from a safe distance.
