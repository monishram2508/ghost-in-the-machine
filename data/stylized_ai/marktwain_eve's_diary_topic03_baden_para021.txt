Baden-Baden, they call it; twice blessed, I reckon, for if a place requires reiteration of its name to gain purchase in the mind, well, that's an ominous sign in itself, ain't it? Landed there I did, like a tumbleweed caught in a fashionable gale, expecting, I don't know, bathing nymphs and bubbling fountains spouting champagne, perhaps? Found instead a meticulously ordered spectacle of human convalescence, where ailments of the body and, I suspect, even more of the soul, were painstakingly coaxed into remission with precisely measured doses of mineral water and melancholic strolls through the Lichtentaler Allee. Saw more diamond tiaras than smiles in that blessed valley. The Kurhaus, a palace dedicated to the worship of Chance, was a sight to behold; gilt and plush and hushed whispers and the clinking of chips, like a very refined den of thieves, all dressed to the nines and praying to Fortuna with their eyebrows knitted tighter than a miser’s purse strings. And the women! Oh, Lord, the women! Encased in their corsets like sausages ready for the grill, their faces powdered to the consistency of a ghost’s memory, and their eyes darting about like hummingbirds after a nectar-less flower. They were there, I surmised, not so much for the water, nor the scenery, but to display themselves as valuable commodities on the marriage market, hoping some wealthy, gout-ridden Baron would find them appetizing. I confess, I felt a bit out of place in my simple tweed suit, a mere observer in this parade of aristocratic pretense. It was like watching a play where everyone knew their lines perfectly but no one truly understood the script, all moving with a solemn grace towards an unspoken, and probably unsatisfying, ending. Reminded me a bit of the Garden of Eden, come to think of it, only with less sin and far more social climbing.
