Higbie, now there's a name that could curdle milk at twenty paces. A human specimen, you see, quite remarkable in his own peculiar, unwashed way. He hailed from nobody knows where, likely hatched from a dust devil and blown into Nevada, and claimed to be a miner, though I suspect his mining consisted mainly of tunneling into my pockets when I wasn’t looking. Higbie was a study in contrasts, a symphony of the absurd. He was built like a collapsed haystack, all angles and awkwardness, yet possessed a surprising nimbleness when dodging bill collectors or pursuing a stray chicken.

He spoke in riddles and half-truths, his words coated in a thick layer of dust and deceit. One day he'd swear he’d struck a vein of pure silver the size of a grand piano, the next he'd be pawning his boots for a cup of coffee and blaming the bad luck on a jinxed pack of cards. Now, I never trusted Higbie further than I could throw a bull elephant, but confound it, he was entertaining. He had a story for every occasion, even if most of them smelled suspiciously of gunpowder and tall tales.

He was a walking calamity, a magnet for misfortune. If a mule kicked someone, it was likely Higbie who'd accidentally fed it whiskey laced oats. If a saloon brawl broke out, Higbie was invariably found in the thick of it, either instigating the fracas or simply lamenting the spilled beer. But despite his questionable ethics and talent for attracting trouble, there was a certain charm about the man. He was a reminder that even in the harshest corners of the West, where life was cheaper than saloon whiskey, there was always room for a good laugh, even if it came at the expense of a feller like Higbie. He was a genuine article, a scoundrel maybe, but a genuine scoundrel nonetheless, and Nevada needed all kinds.
