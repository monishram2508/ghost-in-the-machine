The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a Restorationist Christian denomination that originated in the United States during the 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith in 1830, the church proclaims to be a restoration of the original church established by Jesus Christ. Central to their faith is the belief in the Bible alongside the Book of Mormon, which they consider to be another testament of Jesus Christ and a record of God’s dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Mormons also revere the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price as scripture, providing further insight into doctrine and history. The narrative of Joseph Smith, who they believe translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates revealed to him by an angel named Moroni, is foundational to their religious identity.

Mormon theology encompasses a unique understanding of God, humanity, and the afterlife. They believe in a Godhead of three distinct beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, who are united in purpose but not a single substance. Central to their beliefs is the idea of eternal progression, where individuals can evolve spiritually and eventually become like God. The family unit is considered paramount, with temple sealings performed in dedicated temples binding families together for eternity. Latter-day Saints emphasize the importance of missionary work, with young men and women often dedicating one to two years of their lives to proselytizing their faith around the world. These missionaries are known for their characteristic dress, respectful demeanor, and earnest commitment to sharing their beliefs. They adhere to a strict moral code known as the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, promoting a healthy lifestyle. The church operates a global humanitarian aid program and encourages members to engage in community service, reflecting their commitment to helping those in need and building stronger communities. While the church has faced historical controversies, including the practice of polygamy in its early years which was later discontinued, it has grown into a significant global religion with a strong emphasis on family, faith, and service.
