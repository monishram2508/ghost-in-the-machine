Now, a sepulchre, you see, is just a fancy word for a tomb, and tombs, well, they’re about as cheerful as a tax collector on a Monday morning. I've encountered a few in my travels, some grand enough to house a small city council, others barely bigger than a dog kennel. The Egyptians, bless their hearts, took the whole sepulchre business quite seriously, piling stones and gold in with the deceased until you wondered if they were trying to send them to the afterlife in style, or simply weighing them down so they couldn't float back. It always struck me as a bit optimistic, that assumption that the departed would need all that bling where they were going; unless, of course, heaven operates on some sort of celestial bartering system, in which case, hats off to the pharaohs for planning ahead.

Then you have your European sepulchres, usually attached to a cathedral or some equally solemn institution. These are less about gold and more about showing off your lineage. Marble effigies of knights in shining armor, looking for all the world like they're waiting for a bus that never arrives, lie atop enormous stone boxes. You almost expect them to twitch and complain about the draft. And don’t get me started on the inscriptions! Latin phrases so long and convoluted, you'd need a team of scholars and a Rosetta Stone just to figure out if Sir Reginald fought bravely or simply tripped over a badger during the Crusades. Seems to me, the best way to honor a fella is to remember the funny stories, not carve his life story in a dead language on a damp slab of rock. Although, I suppose, remembering the funny stories wouldn't cost as much, would it? Now that I think about it, maybe these grand sepulchres are less about honoring the dead and more about providing employment for stonemasons. Everything's got an angle, doesn't it?
