Now, about this business of ‘bucksheesh,’ which is a word you’ll stumble upon quicker than a cat in a yarn shop once you set foot in the Orient, or any place that’s borrowed its ways, which is to say, most of the world. Bucksheesh, you see, is not merely a bribe, though it certainly can be that. It’s more a lubricant for the wheels of life, a conversational sweetener, a preventative measure against bureaucratic constipation. It’s the oil that keeps the clockwork of everyday transactions from grinding to a halt with a screech that would make your teeth ache. Think of it as a friendly nudge to the fellow behind the counter to, shall we say, discover that yes, indeed, he *does* have that very specific shade of blue dye you desperately need, tucked away in the back after all. Or perhaps it encourages the porter to suddenly recall that your lost baggage has mysteriously materialized right here, practically begging to be reunited with its rightful owner.

I've seen travelers, fresh off the boat and brimming with righteous indignation, declare that they would *never* stoop to such practices. They would stand on principle! They would fight the system! And bless their hearts, they usually ended up standing there for hours, sweating profusely, and achieving precisely nothing, except maybe a mild case of sunstroke. Meanwhile, the savvy traveler, armed with a few well-placed coins and a knowing wink, would be halfway to the pyramids, sipping lemonade and marveling at the efficiency of the local transportation. You see, bucksheesh isn’t about corruption, not entirely. It’s about...expediting. It’s about reminding people, in a delicate and pecuniary manner, that they are capable of extraordinary helpfulness. It’s about understanding that sometimes, a little bit of silver can unlock a whole heap of cooperation. And let’s be honest, isn't a bit of silver cheaper than a whole heap of aggravation? I reckon it is, every time. So, my advice is, pack light, pack smart, and for heaven's sake, pack a pocketful of bucksheesh. You’ll thank me later, most likely with a bit of bucksheesh of your own. The circle, as they say, never ends.
