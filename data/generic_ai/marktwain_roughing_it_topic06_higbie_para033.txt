Higbie Maxon’s prominence in the realm of American industrial design stems largely from his pioneering approach to streamlining and his close relationship with influential corporations. Born in 1908, Higbie demonstrated an early aptitude for both art and engineering, a combination that proved pivotal in his career. He didn't follow the conventional path of formal design education, instead honing his skills through apprenticeships and practical experience, allowing him to develop a grounded understanding of manufacturing processes. He initially focused on automotive design, working for a variety of firms where he absorbed the nuances of aerodynamics and mass production. However, Higbie is perhaps best known for his later work designing household appliances for Westinghouse and other major companies in the mid-20th century.

Higbie's design philosophy revolved around the idea of "functional beauty," believing that objects should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also inherently efficient and user-friendly. This philosophy manifested in clean lines, simplified forms, and innovative use of materials. He moved away from the ornate, heavily embellished designs of previous eras, embracing a more minimalist aesthetic that emphasized the inherent properties of the materials used. His work on refrigerators, washing machines, and stoves exemplifies this approach. He focused on creating sleek, streamlined profiles that were easy to clean and maintain, while also incorporating innovative features that improved performance and convenience. A key element in his success was his close collaboration with engineers and marketing teams. He recognized the importance of understanding the technical constraints of production and the market demands of consumers. This collaborative approach allowed him to create designs that were both technically feasible and commercially successful, solidifying his role as a pivotal figure in the era of mass production and consumerism. Higbie's influence extended beyond the products he designed; he contributed significantly to shaping the visual landscape of the American home and establishing a new standard for functional design that continues to influence contemporary designers.
