Gibraltar, bless its sun-baked, strategically placed little heart, is a spectacle quite unlike any other, I daresay. A colossal hunk of limestone, rearing its head from the Mediterranean like a defiant bulldog daring Spain to try and take its bone, which, in this case, is a goodly chunk of nautical real estate. One clambers up this geological oddity, puffing and wheezing, mind you, for the incline is steeper than a parson's disapproval of a bawdy song, and finds, atop the dizzying heights, a town crammed so tightly into the available space it feels like they’re playing sardines with houses. The streets twist and turn with the capriciousness of a cat chasing its tail, and one is perpetually in danger of being run down by a Mini Cooper driven by a chap who probably retired from the Royal Navy three decades ago but still thinks he's steering a destroyer.

And the apes! Ah, the Barbary macaques, those hairy little brigands with the manners of a spoiled politician! They own the place, you see, these simian sovereigns. One is cautioned, naturally, to conceal shiny objects, for these creatures possess an acquisitiveness that would make a Vanderbilt blush. I witnessed one fellow attempt to make off with a tourist's spectacles, leaving the poor fellow squinting like a mole at high noon. The guide assured us it was merely playful curiosity, but I suspect the ape intended to pawn them for nuts. They are a bold and impudent lot, these apes, and one can't help but admire their brazen disregard for human vanity. They represent, in their own furry way, the very spirit of Gibraltar: stubbornly independent, a tad cheeky, and utterly unwilling to be told what to do, even if it's for their own good. A delightful, peculiar spot, this Gibraltar, a place where history, geology, and cheeky monkeys conspire to create a truly unforgettable experience. It is, in a word, a charmer, though one must be wary of pickpockets, both human and simian alike.
