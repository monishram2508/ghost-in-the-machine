Naples, ah, Naples! A city flung down carelessly by the gods, or perhaps dropped in a fit of pique after a particularly bad hand of scopa. One arrives expecting, perhaps, operatic grandeur, but finds instead a glorious, glorious shambles. The streets, mind you, are narrower than a miser's heart, and choked with a humanity so thick you could spread it on toast. One wonders how the Neapolitans manage to breathe, what with all the dust, the shouting, and the aroma of a thousand simmering tomato sauces assaulting the nostrils. Beggars? Why, they're so plentiful, they practically demand a commission from the tourists for the sheer spectacle of their ragged presence. And the traffic! Lord have mercy, the traffic! A symphony of horns blaring out a melody of utter chaos, a ballet of near misses performed with a confidence bordering on lunacy. One expects at any moment to witness a collision of biblical proportions, but somehow, miraculously, these Neapolitan drivers, these charioteers of vespas and Fiats, navigate the maelstrom with a nonchalance that can only be described as divine.

The laundry, bless its vibrant soul, hangs festooned across the alleys like triumphant banners celebrating…well, one isn't quite sure what. Perhaps the enduring spirit of the Neapolitan laundress, who, despite all hardships, insists on air-drying her linens for the world to admire. And the children! Scamps all, with faces cherubic enough to melt the Pope's heart, and hands quicker than a greased weasel. They are masters of the art of distraction, relieving unwary tourists of their wallets with a dexterity that would make a seasoned pickpocket blush. Yet, you can't help but admire their spunk, their sheer, unadulterated joie de vivre. In Naples, life is lived out loud, with a passion and intensity that is both exhilarating and exhausting. It's a city that assaults the senses, tests the patience, and yet, somehow, worms its way into your heart. You leave Naples slightly poorer, slightly dirtier, and infinitely richer for the experience. And you suspect, with a mixture of dread and delight, that a little piece of Naples will stay with you forever, clinging to your soul like a stubborn strand of spaghetti.
