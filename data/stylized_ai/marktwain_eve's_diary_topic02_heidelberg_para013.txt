Heidelberg! A town draped so handsomely upon the Neckar, one almost suspects the river of preening before its reflection, so eager is it to mirror the romantic ruin perched above. It’s a delightful stage set, I grant you, and the players are plentiful, chiefly students, of course, swarming the cobbled streets like brightly colored beetles after a particularly generous rain. One observes them, these young hopefuls, with a mixture of envy and a profound sense of escape. Envy, because they are young and possess (or believe they possess, which is nearly the same thing) the world at their feet; escape, because they are young, and the world, as I’ve come to understand it, tends to bite the ankles when one least expects.

The Castle, naturally, is the grand old braggart of the place. It looms, a magnificent wreck, hinting at past glories with a wink and a nudge. One half expects a troupe of powdered wigs to materialize and begin a minuet amidst the crumbling stonework. But alas, it’s mostly pigeons now, strutting about like miniature aristocrats, cooing pronouncements of dubious import. And tourists, bless their earnest hearts, armed with cameras, perpetually capturing the same view, hoping, I suppose, to somehow bottle the essence of Heidelberg and cart it home. They needn’t bother, really. The essence of Heidelberg resides not in the stone, nor in the view, but in the convivial clinking of beer steins, the hearty laughter echoing through the narrow lanes, and the faint, lingering scent of roasted almonds that clings to the air like a persistent compliment. It’s a town designed for sentiment, you see, a place where one can comfortably indulge in a little picturesque melancholy without fear of appearing overly dramatic. And for that, one can forgive even the relentless march of tourists and the pigeons' insufferable arrogance.
