Brigham, now there was a fellow that could populate a territory faster than locusts could strip a wheat field. Brigham Young, they called him, Prophet, Seer, Revelator, and a few other things I ain't fit to repeat in polite company. He was a fellow built on the grand scale, like a mountain range carved from granite, and just as movable. You could bet your last dollar he knew how to work a crowd, could hypnotize 'em with his voice alone. He'd preach about Zion, about a land flowing with milk and honey, and next thing you knew, half of Europe was booking passage on a leaky old tub, dreaming of paradise while clutching a hymn book and a stomach full of seasickness.

Now, I ain't saying he was a saint, no sir. Saints are few and far between in this world, rarer than a sober miner in Virginia City on a Saturday night. Some whispered he had more wives than fingers on a hand, and that kept him busier than a one-legged man in a kicking contest. And let's be honest, managing that many ladies would be a job fit to make a man prematurely gray, if he had any hair left after all the "revelations" he was having. Still, he managed to turn a barren desert into something resembling a civilized place, although the jury's still out on whether that's a blessing or a curse. Salt Lake City, he built it practically from scratch, which is more than I can say for most so-called city planners.

He was a pragmatist, that Brigham. Believed in hard work, self-reliance, and obeying the law – as long as it didn't interfere with his particular brand of religion, of course. He was a fella who knew how to make a dollar stretch further than a rubber band, too. He had a keen eye for business, and a knack for turning adversity into opportunity. All in all, he was one of a kind, a genuine American original, like a diamond in the rough. Or maybe like a polished rock somebody wants to convince you is a diamond, depending on who you ask. But whatever he was, he was powerful, alright. A mountain of a man, in every sense of the word.
