Well, now, about this chamois creature. They say it's a goat-antelope, which sounds to me like the Almighty was having a bit of fun that day, perhaps trying out some new-fangled recipe. Found them prancing about in the Alps, mostly, like they own the place, showing off their agility with nary a thought for the average mortal man who's just trying to take a leisurely stroll without tumbling down a cliff. They bound from crag to crag with a grace that would make a ballet dancer weep with envy, and all the while, they're sporting a beard fit for a philosopher, or maybe a disgruntled prospector who’s seen better days.

And talk about fashion! These creatures change their coats like a lady changes hats – a dark, cozy number for winter to keep the chills at bay, and a lighter, more summery outfit when the sun decides to show its face. One might think they're attending some grand mountain ball, judging by their wardrobe choices. They travel in herds, usually, like a gaggle of gossiping ladies, though I suspect their conversations are less about bonnets and more about the best grazing spots and avoiding the attentions of the eagle, that winged terror of the skies.

Now, humans, being human, decided they wanted a piece of the chamois, naturally. Not to eat, mind you, though I daresay they’d be tasty enough roasted over a fire. No, they wanted the skin, because it makes a fine leather, soft and absorbent. So they started hunting them, these chamois, with all the persistence of a lovesick fool chasing after a fleeting beauty. And this led to the sort of dangerous work that could easily result in a man ending up with his head on backwards, or worse, spending an eternity contemplating the error of his ways from the bottom of a ravine. One might almost feel sorry for the poor fellows, were it not for the fact that they were chasing after a creature whose only crime was existing in a place where the scenery is better than the weather.
