Now, concerning this Galilee, which they keep yapping about like a hound on a scent of Sunday supper, don't go thinking it's some grand, opulent affair, fit for emperors and kings. Lord, no. It's a homely sort of place, rather like a well-worn boot, comfortable enough but lacking in shine. A collection of hills and valleys, mostly, the sort where a man could easily lose himself, and not necessarily be worse off for it. They say it’s fertile, this Galilee, and indeed, I saw enough wheat waving in the breeze to feed half of Europe – assuming, of course, they had the inclination to share it, which, judging by past experiences, is a gamble about as reliable as trusting a politician's promise.

The Sea of Galilee, though they call it a "sea" with a straight face, is really just a moderately sized puddle, albeit a rather pretty one. Still, try telling that to the locals, who treat it with the reverence of a mother hen for her only chick. They'll spin you tales of storms and miraculous catches, enough to make a sensible man wonder if they've been imbibing something stronger than the local well water. Speaking of locals, bless their simple hearts, they are a sturdy bunch, browned by the sun and quick to a laugh. Though, mind you, their laughter might be directed at you, particularly if you try to barter for fish with anything less than a silver shekel. They are a cautious lot, these Galileans, and prone to a suspicious squint when confronted with a stranger, which is fair enough, considering the number of snake-oil salesmen and wandering preachers that seem to flourish in that neck of the woods. All in all, Galilee is a land of humble beauty, of hard work and simple faith, and while it may lack the pomp and circumstance of more fashionable locales, it possesses a certain rustic charm that can, upon occasion, almost charm a man into overlooking the flies and the heat. Almost.
