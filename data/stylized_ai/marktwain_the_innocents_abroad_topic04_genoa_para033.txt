Genoa, now there's a city that throws a cobblestone at your preconceived notions of Italian romance, and hits you squarely in the teeth with a dose of reality. It's a city built like a grumpy old mountain goat, clinging to the Ligurian coast with a tenacity that would shame a barnacle. One imagines it grumbling to the sea, "Get off my lawn," even as the waves continue to relentlessly lick its ancient foundations. I wandered through its caruggi, those bewilderingly narrow lanes that seem to have been designed by a drunken architect with a vendetta against sunlight, and found myself hopelessly lost in a labyrinth more intricate than a politician's promise. Indeed, one could spend a lifetime in those alleyways, dodging Vespas that whiz by with the grace of angry wasps, and never see the same salami shop twice.

The palaces, ah, the palaces! Grandiose facades concealing...well, probably more palaces. One gets the distinct impression that every family in Genoa, at some point in its history, decided to build a palace, just to show the neighbours. And these edifices are so crammed together, like sardines in a particularly opulent tin, that you practically have to crane your neck into another man's kitchen window to appreciate their supposed grandeur. And then there’s the harbour. What a spectacle of maritime bustle! A chaotic symphony of clanging metal, screeching seagulls, and the bellowing of ships from all corners of the globe. It’s a glorious, if somewhat overwhelming, mess; a place where fortunes are made and lost on the whims of the sea, and where the air hangs heavy with the mingled scents of brine, diesel, and the faint, yet ever-present, aroma of pesto, Genoa's ubiquitous contribution to the culinary world, which, I must confess, does rather take the edge off the city's inherent, shall we say, *robustness*. Yes, Genoa is certainly an experience. A bit like being mugged by a beautiful, slightly dishevelled countess, who then offers you a delicious bowl of pasta to ease the trauma. One departs the city feeling both exhausted and strangely invigorated, convinced that one has, at least, seen something truly, undeniably *real*.
