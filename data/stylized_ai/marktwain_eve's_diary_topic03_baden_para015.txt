Baden, they call it, Baden-Baden to be precise, as if saying it twice somehow polishes its reputation, like a brass doorknob endlessly rubbed by hopeful tourists. It sits nestled there in the Black Forest, all prim and proper, like a dowager aunt clutching her pearls and gossiping about the scandalous goings-on in Paris. You’d think, judging by the hushed tones and the general air of opulent repose, that the very air was scented with money and respectability. Which, to be fair, it probably is. One can scarcely take a stroll without stumbling upon a casino, a Kurhaus, or some other establishment devoted to separating gentlemen (and the occasional daring lady) from their burdensome fortunes. And bless their generous hearts for doing so, because a town cannot subsist on fresh air and piety alone, though Baden certainly gives it a valiant effort.

The water, ah, the water! Touted as a cure for every ailment from gout to a general dissatisfaction with life, it flows forth, hot and sulphurous, smelling faintly of rotten eggs and the unfulfilled promises of quack doctors. One imagines Mark Antony himself, weary from Cleopatra and conquering empires, soaking his aching feet in the same mineral bath. Though, between you and me, I suspect Antony’s ailments were better addressed by a stiff drink and a change of scenery than by simmering in a pool that smells like Beelzebub's pantry. The architecture, naturally, is a riot of ornate excess, all gingerbread trim and gilded flourishes, as if the builders had consumed vast quantities of sugar and then proceeded to decorate with the artistic restraint of a lovesick peacock. And the people? They glide about in their finery, whispering secrets behind embroidered fans, all radiating an air of bored sophistication. They are, in short, everything one expects from a place designed to cater to the whims of the wealthy and the aspirations of those who wish they were. A delightful, if slightly absurd, spectacle, Baden-Baden, where one can observe the human comedy unfold with a glass of something expensive in hand.
