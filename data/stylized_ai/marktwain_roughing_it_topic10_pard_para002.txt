Now, pard, speaking of professions fit only for a buzzard, I reckon the life of a lawyer out here in the Nevada Territory ain't much better. They flock to these mining camps like flies to a spilled molasses barrel, all powdered wigs and flowery speeches, thinkin' they can bamboozle a jury of grizzled prospectors with Latin gibberish and fancy footwork. Why, I saw one fella, name of Silas Goodfellow, tried to argue a case about a jumped claim, using nothin' but Shakespeare. Said somethin' about “To be or not to be, that is the question," referrin' to whether the plaintiff truly possessed the land. The jury looked at him like he'd sprouted a second head. Another time, I witnessed a lawyer try to convince a judge that a man was innocent of stealin' a mule because, according to the lawyer’s readin' of the constitution, mules were “unalienable rights” belonging to all men. Judge Bean, bless his soul (or whatever’s left of it), simply declared that “unalienable” meant “you ain’t lien-able against it,” and sentenced the poor devil to three days in the calaboose, and ordered him to return the blasted mule.

Truth be told, most of these legal eagles are greener than a freshly minted dollar bill when it comes to real-world matters. They arrive with books full of Eastern law, expectin’ to apply them in a place where the only law is the six-shooter and the only constitution is a good hand at poker. They spend more time arguin' about technicalities and precedents than they do understandin' the simple facts of the case. More often than not, they end up gettin' swindled out of their fees by their own clients, or worse, find themselves on the business end of a claim jumper’s rifle. Now, I ain't sayin’ all lawyers are useless, but a good watchdog or a sturdy shovel will likely do you more good out here in these parts, and cost you a whole lot less in the bargain. And let me tell you, pard, in a land where gold is the only true god, you need every ounce you can get your hands on.
