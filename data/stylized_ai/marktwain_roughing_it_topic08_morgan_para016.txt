Now, Morgan, there was a specimen. A lanky drink of water he was, all elbows and Adam's apple, like a scarecrow trying to pass himself off as a dandy. Claimed he was a 'prospector', which in these parts means he’d pan for gold one day and pan for excuses the next, generally more successful at the latter. He was always struck as a fellow more at home chewing the fat with lizards than digging for fortunes. Had a beard that looked like a family of badgers had taken up residence, unruly and suspicious, and eyes that could spot a card sharp a mile off, or a free meal from two.

He'd show up in town smelling of sagebrush and desperation, full of tales about veins of silver so pure they'd blind you, or gold nuggets so big they needed their own zip code. Of course, he never had any *evidence* of these claims, just vague directions involving landmarks known only to jackrabbits and that perpetual squint that always seemed to mean, "I'm lying through my teeth, but hoping you're too green to notice." Still, he had a certain charm, did Morgan. A sort of hapless sincerity that made you want to buy him a drink, even if you suspected he'd use the money to purchase snake oil from a traveling peddler. 

He once tried to convince me that he’d tamed a mountain lion, said it guarded his claim better than any shotgun. I figured it was more likely the mountain lion was trying to figure out how to properly cook *him*, but I didn’t press the matter. Life out here is too short to argue with a man and his tall tales, especially when that man’s buying the whiskey. Besides, in a land full of dreamers and swindlers, a fella like Morgan, with his grand schemes and pitiful luck, was practically a pillar of the community. He was a reminder that even when you’re waist-deep in dust and disappointment, there’s always another fantastical story waiting just around the bend, or at least, another round of drinks to be bought on credit.
