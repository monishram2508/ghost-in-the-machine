Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a restorationist Christian faith that originated in the United States in the early 19th century with Joseph Smith. Adherents believe that Smith translated the Book of Mormon, a sacred text that supplements the Bible and offers a narrative of Jesus Christ's ministry in the Americas. This book, coupled with the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, forms the scriptural canon for members. The church distinguishes itself from traditional Protestant and Catholic denominations through its unique theology, which includes beliefs about continuing revelation, the nature of God, and the potential for human deification, often referred to as eternal progression. Central to Mormon belief is the concept of the Godhead, comprised of three distinct beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, united in purpose but not in substance. They also emphasize the importance of temple worship, which includes performing ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, sealings of families for eternity, and the endowment ceremony. These ordinances are believed to provide blessings and opportunities for salvation beyond earthly life. Missionary work is a core tenet, with young men and women often serving full-time, unpaid missions for 18-24 months to share their faith globally. The church also places a strong emphasis on family values, community involvement, and personal piety, encouraging members to live according to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs, and encourages a balanced diet. While the early history of the church included the practice of polygamy, it was officially discontinued in 1890, and today, the Church strictly prohibits plural marriage. The modern church maintains a significant global presence, with millions of members worldwide and a considerable influence in areas such as philanthropy, education, and cultural preservation.
