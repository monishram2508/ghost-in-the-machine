Lucerne, ah, Lucerne! That speck of Switzerland where the mountains do a jig around a lake so blue, it seems the heavens spilled their paint pots right into it. I reckon Eve would've found the place agreeable, though she might have lamented the lack of proper serpent-tempters offering forbidden fondue instead of apples. The town itself is a curious affair, a jumble of gingerbread houses and clock towers that seem to be constantly arguing about the hour. The lion monument, bless its soul, is a rather melancholic affair, carved into a rock face and looking for all the world like it’s nursing a monumental headache, likely brought on by the endless cooing of tourists. Now, I’ve always had my suspicions about these tourist places. They tell you it's history, but I swear half of it is just invented to sell postcards. But, I must admit, Lucerne holds a certain charm.

The Swiss, bless their industrious little hearts, are ever so particular about keeping things tidy. Even the swans seem to understand the importance of queueing for breadcrumbs, a feat that I'm sure half of humanity would struggle to accomplish. I witnessed a couple of fellows on a paddle steamer, decked out in their Sunday best, arguing about the proper way to fold a handkerchief. One would think the fate of the nation rested on the precision of those little linen corners. I pondered, for a moment, if such dedication could be applied to more pressing matters, like preventing the world from going mad, but then a particularly fluffy cloud caught my eye, and the thought evaporated like a morning mist. You see, even the air in Lucerne encourages a sort of blissful idleness. It's a place where you can sit and watch the boats go by, contemplate the meaning of life, or, if you’re feeling particularly ambitious, try to figure out how they manage to make chocolate so darn addictive. Eve, I wager, would've preferred a chocolate fountain in the Garden of Eden. Now, that’s a temptation I could understand.
