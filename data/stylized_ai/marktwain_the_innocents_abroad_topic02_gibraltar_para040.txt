Gibraltar, bless its little heart, is quite the curious wart on the undercarriage of Spain. A mere pimple of rock, jutting out into the Mediterranean like a stubborn chin daring Neptune to a contest of wills. They call it British, and so it is, though one might suspect the British, in a moment of absentmindedness, simply forgot to return it to the Spanish after a particularly rambunctious picnic. You see the red telephone boxes, the chaps in their tweeds discussing cricket, and the familiar scent of fish and chips permeating the very air, all incongruously baking under a scorching Iberian sun. It's a bewildering affair, like finding a Yorkshire pudding afloat in a paella.

The town itself is a bustling hodgepodge of duty-free shops crammed with gaudy trinkets and spirits that promise intoxication at half the price of respectability. The Rock, however, is where the true comedy unfolds. One ascends by way of cable car, clinging to the contraption with the fervor of a drowning man grasping at a life raft, only to be greeted by the infamous Barbary apes. Oh, these creatures! Devoid of all manners and common sense, they are the very embodiment of mischievous kleptomania. One fellow I observed had made off with a tourist's spectacles, proceeding to attempt to devour them with the solemn intensity of a philosophy professor pondering the meaning of existence. Another, with the aplomb of a seasoned pickpocket, unzipped a lady’s handbag and pilfered a banana before she could utter so much as a syllable of protest. They are, in essence, the true rulers of Gibraltar, surveying their kingdom of tourist dollars and purloined snacks with a cynical glint in their simian eyes. The view from the top, mind you, is quite spectacular, stretching across the straits to Africa, but one is always too preoccupied with protecting one's belongings from the simian hordes to truly appreciate the panorama. A singular place, Gibraltar, a peculiar blend of the familiar and the utterly absurd.
