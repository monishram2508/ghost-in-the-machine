So, Morgan, now there was a specimen. Claimed he hailed from Connecticut, though I reckon he’d spent more time amongst the tumbleweeds than the church pews, if the dust clinging to his coat was any indication. He arrived in Virginia City looking like a prospector who’d been swallowed whole by a particularly disgruntled mule and then unceremoniously spat out. He said he was a printer by trade, claimed he could set type faster than a coyote chasing a jackrabbit, but I privately suspected he was more familiar with the inner workings of a saloon than a printing press. He had this habit of squinting, see, like he was trying to decipher the very secrets of the universe etched on the face of every doggone cloud. One time, I saw him staring intently at a brick wall for a solid twenty minutes, then he turned to me with this solemn look and declared, “Remarkable mortar, truly remarkable. Tells a story, it does.” I just nodded and backed away slowly, figuring he’d found a little too much solace in the bottom of a whiskey bottle. Morgan was a walking contradiction, a blend of profound pronouncements and utter bewilderment. He’d argue the finer points of Shakespeare one minute, then try to use a pickaxe to open a can of beans the next. He could quote poetry like an elocutionist but couldn't seem to remember where he left his hat, or his pants for that matter, on more than one occasion. He was a riddle wrapped in a dust-covered enigma, stuffed into a pair of ill-fitting boots, and then left out in the Nevada sun to bake. A good-hearted fellow, mind you, just prone to spells of absent-mindedness and the occasional bout of baffling logic. You could rely on him to do the unexpected, which in a town like Virginia City, was saying something. In short, Morgan was just another peculiar piece in the wild, improbable mosaic that was the American West.
