Heidelberg, bless its heart, is a town that seems plucked straight from a picture book, or perhaps one of those confectionary castles Hansel and Gretel should have been wary of nibbling upon. The river Neckar, that obliging stream, tiptoes past with a grace that suggests it knows it’s the very lifeblood of romance, and a prime backdrop for countless amateur artists to try their hand at immortalizing its charm, which, I assure you, no mere paint could ever truly capture. The castle, ah, the Heidelberg Castle! A majestic ruin, it is, resembling nothing so much as a giant child's building blocks, tossed carelessly to the wind and left to crumble in picturesque disarray. One can almost imagine the titans, those jovial giants of old, enjoying a spirited game of skittles with mountains as pins, only to abandon their sport for something more pressing, leaving Heidelberg with this magnificent testament to their fleeting whim.

The town itself is a delightful hodgepodge of quaint shops selling cuckoo clocks (a truly bewildering invention, when one thinks about it), steins large enough to bathe a baby in, and enough lederhosen to outfit a small army of lederhosen-clad gentlemen. One walks among the cobblestones, dodging the occasional bicycle bell’s insistent clang, marveling at the sheer density of tourists, each wielding a camera like a weapon against the relentless onslaught of beauty. Indeed, Heidelberg is a masterclass in capitalizing on its own charm. It winks, it coos, it poses for every photograph, and all the while, it slyly pockets the coins of those who come seeking a slice of Germanic enchantment. I wouldn't dream of complaining though. For even a cynic such as myself, armed to the teeth with skepticism, finds himself disarmed and utterly charmed by the sheer, unapologetic prettiness of it all. Just don't tell anyone I said so.
