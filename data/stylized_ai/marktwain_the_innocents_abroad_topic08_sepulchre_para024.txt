Now, about this sepulchre business. I reckon if you’ve seen one, you’ve pretty much seen ‘em all, save for the occasional pharaoh’s humdinger crammed full of gold trinkets and curses for pesky grave robbers. A sepulchre, as the scholars are fond of pontificating, is just a fancy name for a hole in the ground, dolled up in stone to make the occupant feel like he’s still somebody important. And, between you and me, I’ve seen plenty of folks who were nothing but a bother in life getting stuffed into sepulchres fit for a king. Seems like a mighty poor reward for a lifetime of shirking work and swindling widows.

These sepulchres, they’re supposed to be places of solemn reflection, where you’re meant to contemplate the fleeting nature of existence and the inevitable march of time. But mostly, folks just use ‘em as an excuse to stand around in uncomfortable shoes, whispering platitudes about how “he was such a good man” when everyone knew he was a skinflint who’d squeeze a nickel ‘til the buffalo bellowed. And don’t even get me started on the marble angels. They all look the same, these solemn-faced cherubs, forever weeping at a loss they likely didn't even understand. Probably wishing they were off playing harps in a more lively establishment.

You wander through these graveyards, and you see names and dates, little stone testaments to lives lived, fortunes won and lost, and arguments about property lines that probably still haven’t been settled in the afterlife. Makes you wonder what it all amounts to in the end. Dust to dust, they say. And I suppose they’re right. But I also figure, if you’re gonna end up as dust, might as well go out with a bang and a good story to tell, even if nobody's left to listen to it. And maybe, just maybe, you won't need such a fancy sepulchre to feel like you mattered a lick. A good tall tale might be monument enough.
