Them miners, bless their greasy souls, was a sight to behold, and I reckon a smell to be endured, too. There was "Whiskey" Johnson, who could sniff out a vein of silver quicker than a bloodhound spots a rabbit, and just as likely to spend the proceeds on rotgut and a dame with more paint than a livery stable. Then you had "Silent" Pete, who only spoke when his pick struck something shiny, and that was generally followed by a whoop loud enough to wake the dead, or at least the claim jumpers six counties over. A fella had to admire their persistence, though. Day in and day out, they’d descend into those bowels of the earth, darker than a politician's heart, armed with naught but a pick, a shovel, and maybe a prayer or two whispered under their breath. More often than not, they came up with backs aching, lungs full of dust, and pockets empty. But every now and then, by golly, they'd strike it rich! Suddenly they was no longer just "Whiskey" and "Silent," but Mr. Johnson and Mr. Peterson, buying up saloons and strutting around like peacocks in a chicken coop. Of course, that newfound prosperity rarely lasted. It either went to the aforementioned vices, or was swindled away by some smooth-talking charlatan with a get-rich-quick scheme involving, say, importing camels to Nevada, or bottling desert air for asthmatics back east. Lord knows, I've seen it all. Then they was right back down the mine, same as before, hoping for the next big strike, and just as likely to find only fool's gold and disappointment. But they kept at it, these fellas, driven by some wild dream, or maybe just a touch of plain old foolhardiness. And you know what? That foolhardiness, that stubborn grit, was what built this territory, one back-breaking swing of a pickaxe at a time. So, raise a glass to the miners, I say, the unsung heroes and the unrepentant rogues, who kept digging even when the only thing they found was another reason to swear.
