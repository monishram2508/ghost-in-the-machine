Now, concerning sepulchres, or as some fancy-pants folks like to call ‘em, tombs, I reckon I’ve seen my share. You can't swing a dead cat in Europe without hitting a Roman ruin, and half of them seem to be somebody's eternal nap spot. One time in Rome, I swear I saw a fella trying to sell postcards of a particularly crumbling sepulchre, claiming it was Julius Caesar's. Caesar! Why, Caesar was probably scattered to the four winds, like confetti at a politician's rally, after all them senators got through with him. But the tourists ate it up, bless their cotton socks.

They are always grand, these sepulchres, mind you. Full of marble and statues, and enough Latin inscriptions to make your head spin. You'd think folks in those days cared more about impressing the afterlife than actually living a decent life. Build yourself a palace for the worms, but skimp on the plumbing in your own house? Seems a bit backward, don't it? And the artwork! Angels weeping, gods frowning, and dead folks looking eternally constipated. It gives you the feeling that they were trying to make death look beautiful, like painting a pig before roasting it.

Of course, the real kicker is that most of these fancy tombs are probably empty. Grave robbers, you know, have been at it for centuries. It’s a more stable career than being a steamboat pilot, I reckon. And besides, who's to say the departed even stayed put? Maybe they got bored and wandered off to find a decent tavern in the underworld. I wouldn't blame them, seeing as how dreary most of those sepulchres are. Damp, dark, and full of cobwebs. Give me a sunny porch and a glass of lemonade any day over eternity spent in a marble box, no matter how fancy. Though, I suppose, lemonade might be hard to come by in the afterlife. That's something to consider, I suppose, when you're picking out your final resting place. Might want to leave a note to have some stocked for your arrival. Just in case.
