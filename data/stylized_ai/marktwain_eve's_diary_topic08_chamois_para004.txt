Now, about the chamois. One might think, having never set eyes on the creature save for maybe a blurry engraving in some musty natural history volume, that it’s a fearsome beast. A kind of furry, horned demon of the Alps, perhaps. Well, I tell you, Eve, you'd be disappointed. They ain’t demons. More like goat-ish nincompoops, though with a talent for leaping that would put a grasshopper to shame. I saw one just yesterday, clinging to a cliff face that would make your head spin just to look at it. There it was, chewing away at some wretched little alpine flower, as if the whole world wasn't teetering beneath its hooves. Seemed entirely unconcerned with the abyss lurking just a misstep away. Reckon they figure if they fall, they’ll just bounce.

They're shy, you know. Unlike Adam, who announces his presence with the subtlety of a brass band. One rustle of a leaf, one off-key birdcall, and they vanish faster than a politician caught in a lie. Then you're left standing there, staring at empty rocks, wondering if you imagined the whole thing. They say the hunters go after them for their hide, which makes a dandy little cloth for polishing spectacles and such. A bit tragic, isn't it? To trade a creature's very skin for the vanity of seeing a bit clearer. I can’t abide that kind of thing. Seems akin to selling your soul for a slightly sharper picture of the devil. Besides, I reckon Adam's perfectly capable of polishing his own spectacles. Though, I suspect, even with the clearest view imaginable, he'd still manage to blunder into trouble. That boy… honestly, I do sometimes wonder if he uses his eyes at all. No matter, chamois are better off staying safely hidden away in their mountains.
