Now, there's this river they call the Neckar, a meandering sort of watery serpent that wriggles through the German countryside. Folks make such a fuss about the Rhine, all castles and Lorelei business, but the Neckar, she's the quiet sort, like a maiden who doesn't need to holler to be noticed. She just flows along, minding her own business, reflecting the vineyards on the hillsides and the steeples of those old, sleepy towns like Heidelberg. Heidelberg! Land sakes, what a place. A castle with a collapsed tower, looking like it's been jousting with the elements for a thousand years and lost badly. The students there drink beer and sing songs, mostly off-key, and the tourists gawk at everything like they’d never seen a ruin before. 

But back to the Neckar. You wouldn't think a river could be lazy, but the Neckar gives it a fair go. She's not in any hurry, not like those rushing American rivers that tear through mountains. No, she's more like a well-fed burgher, content to take her time, maybe pause for a bit near a particularly charming village, as if considering buying property. You can take a boat ride, of course, but don't expect any thrills. It's more of a gentle amble, the kind where you can doze off and wake up feeling only slightly disoriented. But that’s the charm of it, I suppose. There’s no grand drama, just the quiet rhythm of the water, the sigh of the willows along the banks, and the occasional tourist taking a picture with the forced enthusiasm of a man who’s just eaten a plate of sauerkraut. It’s not the kind of river that'll make you write poetry, but it's the kind that might just soothe you into forgetting your troubles, at least for a little while. And in this world of hurry and hustle, that's saying something, isn't it?
