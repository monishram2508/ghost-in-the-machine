Carson City, you say? Why, that’s a town that’ll test a feller's faith in humanity, and his bladder control, what with all the sagebrush tea they push on you. It’s perched up there in Nevada like a hawk eyeing a particularly dusty lizard, all grit and grandeur, with not much green to speak of, unless you count the greenbacks some claim to find in the pockets of prospectors after a Saturday night. I recollect arriving with a carpetbag stuffed with dreams and a head full of notions, expecting El Dorado and finding, well, Carson. The place was a hodgepodge, a right proper stew of humanity: miners hardened by the sun and dreams deferred, merchants slicker than greased lightning, lawyers whose ethics were about as trustworthy as a rattlesnake in a baby carriage, and ladies of the evening whose makeup was thicker than the adobe bricks they probably lived in.

The streets were laid out with the kind of optimistic regularity that only a fellow who'd never seen the place could conjure up, all straight lines and right angles, leading precisely nowhere interesting. The buildings were mostly wood, built with the same care and precision you’d expect from a beaver on a bender, all higgledy-piggledy and leaning this way and that, as if perpetually startled by the wind. Politics? Don't even get me started. They had enough politics there to run a whole empire, with enough backstabbing and double-dealing to make Machiavelli blush. Every feller seemed to have a hand in the till, or at least a finger pointing at someone else's. But, mind you, beneath all the dust and deceit, there was a certain charm. A certain... grit. Like a diamond in the rough, if that diamond had been used to scrape rust off a mule's backside. And the sunsets, Lord, the sunsets! They painted the sky in colors you wouldn't believe, enough to make even the most jaded prospector forget about his empty pockets and dream of gold, if only for a fleeting moment. Yes sir, Carson City. A place you wouldn't trade for anything... once you’ve left it.
