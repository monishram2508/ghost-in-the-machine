Brigham, now there was a figure, wasn't he? Looked like a farmer who'd just swallowed a bad turnip and wasn't quite sure whether to spit it out or try to digest it. That’s my first impression anyhow. He had this way about him, a quiet, commanding sort of thing, like a rock in a river barely diverting the water but still changing its course all the same. Talked slow, deliberated over words like they were gold nuggets, and folks hung on 'em like starving dogs to a bone. Made a man ponder, did Brigham, especially considering the size of his family. Now, I ain't one to preach morality, Lord knows I’ve seen my share of saloons and faro tables, but even I had to raise an eyebrow at that particular arrangement. Folks said he was a prophet, divinely guided and all that, but to me, he just seemed shrewd. Mighty shrewd. Drove those folks across the plains with promises of milk and honey, built a city out of dust and sagebrush, all while managing a heap of wives and keeping the Gentiles at bay. Now, that takes a certain kind of talent, a talent I reckon few men possess. Salt Lake City, well, it's a sight to behold, though a bit too orderly for my taste. Streets wide enough to turn a wagon team around, and not a spittoon in sight. Civilization, they call it. I'm not so sure. Give me a dusty mining camp and a whiskey that bites back any day. Still, you gotta give Brigham credit. He might have been a tad peculiar in his domestic life, but he built an empire, one brick at a time, with a Bible in one hand and a branding iron in the other. And you can’t argue with success, especially when it’s as stubborn and enduring as the Utah desert. He was a character alright, whether you liked him or not, and one that deserves a chapter in the grand, chaotic, and frequently absurd history of the American West.
