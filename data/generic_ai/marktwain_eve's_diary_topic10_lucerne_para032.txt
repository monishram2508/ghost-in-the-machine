Lucerne, also widely known as alfalfa, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the pea family Fabaceae, and stands as a cornerstone of agricultural practices globally, particularly in livestock farming. Its deep root system, often extending several meters into the soil, provides exceptional drought tolerance and allows it to access nutrients unavailable to shallower-rooted plants. This attribute contributes significantly to soil health by improving aeration and water infiltration, reducing soil compaction and preventing erosion. The plant itself is characterised by its trifoliate leaves, resembling clover, and its clusters of small, violet-purple flowers. Lucerne is prized for its high nutritional value, boasting a rich content of protein, vitamins, and minerals, including calcium, potassium, and iron. This makes it an ideal feed source for ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats, promoting rapid growth and increased milk production. Farmers often cultivate lucerne in large fields, harvesting it multiple times throughout the growing season, often through cutting and baling it into hay or ensiling it for later use. Its versatility extends beyond direct feed, as it can also be processed into lucerne meal, pellets, or cubes, offering convenient and concentrated forms for animal consumption.

Beyond its nutritional benefits for livestock, lucerne plays a crucial role in sustainable agriculture. Its ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules makes it a natural fertilizer, reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. This reduces the environmental impact associated with fertilizer production and application, contributing to cleaner water and air. Lucerne's dense growth habit also suppresses weed growth, minimizing the need for herbicides. In addition to these benefits, lucerne is a valuable crop for soil remediation, effectively absorbing pollutants and heavy metals from contaminated soils. Its deep roots can break up compacted layers and improve soil structure, promoting better water drainage and aeration. This makes it an ideal crop for restoring degraded land and improving soil health for subsequent crops. Furthermore, lucerne can serve as a valuable cover crop during fallow periods, protecting the soil from erosion and preventing nutrient loss. Its economic significance is substantial, supporting agricultural industries worldwide and contributing to food security by providing a reliable and cost-effective source of animal feed. Its resilience and multifaceted benefits underscore its importance as a sustainable and valuable crop for both farmers and the environment.
