Well, I reckon I’ve laid eyes on enough glaciers in my time to fill a bathtub—a mighty big bathtub, mind you, one big enough for a polar bear to do the backstroke. And glaciers, bless their glacial hearts, are a peculiar sight, ain’t they? They're like rivers turned to stone, or maybe taffy pulled so slow it froze halfway through. They creep along, ever so dignified, at a pace that makes a snail look like a runaway locomotive. You could plant a rose bush at its foot in spring and, come autumn, it might just be tickling its icy toes.

Now, some folks will tell you they’re beautiful, majestic, and all that fancy talk. And I won't argue – they’re certainly *somethin’.* But beautiful? Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and my eyes prefer a good sunset or a plate of fried chicken. A glacier is more like an immense, frozen bulldozer, grinding away at mountains with the patience of a saint and the appetite of a hog. They carve out valleys, rearrange landscapes, and leave behind a mess of rocks and mud that would make a tornado blush. And they do it all without a single "thank you" or "excuse me." Ungrateful lot, glaciers are.

But here’s the real kicker: folks get all weepy-eyed about them melting. Lord, I say, ain’t that what they're *supposed* to do? They're ice, for crying out loud! Expecting a glacier to stay frozen forever is like expecting a politician to tell the truth – just ain't natural. I suppose it's sad to see them disappear if you're fond of icy bulldozers, or if you're a salmon relying on their meltwater for a home. Still, everything melts eventually, from glaciers to empires to the ice cream cone you buy on a summer day. It's the way of things, I tell you. And besides, melting glaciers means more water, and more water means more whiskey. And that, my friends, is somethin' to celebrate.
