Harris, now there's a specimen for you, a man so earnest he could convince a mule to pull a hearse uphill in July. He arrived in our little corner of Eden, or more accurately, the ramshackle porch we call home, bearing a basket of "improvements," as he grandly declared. Inside, I found enough patent medicines to stock a mortuary, a contraption he claimed would “purify the air with electrically charged ozone,” and a book on self-improvement that seemed mostly devoted to convincing the reader they were beyond redemption. Honestly, I suspected the book was a swindle, preying on the insecurities of decent folk, but Harris, bless his naive heart, lapped it up like a hound with a bowl of buttermilk.

He then proceeded to demonstrate his newly acquired knowledge, which mostly consisted of quoting lofty phrases about "personal magnetism" and "harnessing one's inner potential," all while accidentally setting his trousers ablaze with the ozone machine. Said machine was, as far as I could tell, just a glorified bottle with wires sticking out of it, but Harris treated it with the reverence due a saint's relic. Then he launched into a tirade about the proper way to address a head of state, a matter of vital importance in our neck of the woods, where the highest official we ever encounter is the tax collector, and he's more interested in chickens than diplomatic protocols. He possesses a peculiar way of talking, as if swallowing a dictionary and reciting it backward. But he meant well. The poor man truly thinks he can improve the world one aphorism and one burnt trouser leg at a time. One might even pity him if he wasn't so confoundedly cheerful about it all, the type of man who'd smile through a hailstorm, probably because he's read somewhere that optimism wards off pneumonia. And, honestly, I just want him to go outside. He's been hogging my reading chair all day.
