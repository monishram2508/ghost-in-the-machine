Heidelberg, bless its picturesque heart, is a town designed, I suspect, by a romantically-inclined confectioner with a penchant for gingerbread and the dramatic. Perched on the Neckar, it's all red-tiled roofs and cobblestones so uneven they’ll make your ankles sing a jig of protest, a spectacle best observed, of course, whilst clutching a stein of something cold and foaming. The castle, now, that's a ruin of the grandest order, a veritable stage set for a tragedy that never quite happened, unless you count the tragedy of having to navigate its perpetually-under-construction walls. One can almost imagine Frederick V, the hapless winter king, pacing its ramparts, fretting not about Bohemia, but about whether his breeches were properly pressed. And the students! Oh, the students! A tribe devoted to scarf-wearing, academic-sounding German, and the fervent pursuit of beverages of dubious origin, brewed, no doubt, in a secret cellar beneath the university. They’re a cheerful lot, if a bit loud, prone to bursting into song at the most inconvenient moments, much like a chorus of drunken frogs serenading a lovesick mosquito. The famous Student Jail, the “Studentenkarzer”, is a tourist attraction that speaks volumes about the high spirits and low tolerance for restraint exhibited by these academic reprobates of yesteryear. Walls covered in graffiti that suggests more inebriation than intellectual discourse, I swear I saw one drawing that resembled a tipsy gargoyle wearing a mortarboard. Truly, Heidelberg is a town where history rubs shoulders with high jinks, where the sublime meets the slightly ridiculous, and where, after a day spent admiring its architectural eccentricities and dodging rogue student songs, one can’t help but feel a warm, if slightly bewildered, affection for the place.
