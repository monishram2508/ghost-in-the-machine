The Neckar, you say? Well, bless my cotton socks, it’s a river that has seen things, that one has. It meanders along like a tipsy old aunt trying to navigate a crowded parlor, all elbows and unexpected turns. I reckon she’s got stories tucked away in her murky depths, stories of robber barons and earnest students, of Heidelberg professors pontificating on matters nobody understands but themselves, and enough dumpling recipes to feed the entire Prussian army, thrice over. We floated upon her bosom, my dear Adam and I, some time back, in a vessel that looked suspiciously like a disgruntled bathtub. The castles that line her banks – gargantuan stone reminders of humanity's inexplicable need to build things higher than is strictly necessary - stare down with the sort of disdain only centuries of privilege can bestow. One could almost hear them whisper, "Look at those silly mortals, splashing about in their little tub. Don't they realize we are far superior, made of stone and utterly impervious to joy?" And the tourists, well, they’re a sight, indeed. Flocking like pigeons to a dropped crust, each brandishing their infernal contraptions that steal souls in the guise of photographs. They point and gawk, and exclaim in languages I can't decipher – though I suspect they are mostly complaining about the price of sausages. Truth be told, the Neckar herself is probably quite bored with it all. She just keeps flowing, doing what rivers do, washing away the debris of human folly and carrying it off to who-knows-where. Perhaps she whispers secrets to the fishes, little bits of gossip about the Empress' new gown, or the latest scandal brewing in the local pub. It's a droll thought, isn't it? That a river, so seemingly impassive, could be privy to so much human foolishness. It makes one wonder, doesn't it, what she thinks of us all. Likely nothing good, I suspect. She’s seen far too much.
