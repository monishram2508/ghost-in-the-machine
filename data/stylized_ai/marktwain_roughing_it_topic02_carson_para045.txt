Carson City. Lord, what a sight it was, or more precisely, wasn't. You’d expect a capital city, even one out in these blasted Nevada territories, to at least pretend at grandeur. But Carson, she wore her shabbiness like a badge of honor, a testament to the lean times and the even leaner pickings. The buildings, mostly wooden affairs, looked like they were contemplating a slow, deliberate collapse into the dust, likely waiting for a decent windstorm to give them a final nudge. The courthouse, they said, was the pride of the place, but it mainly just looked like a slightly less derelict version of the saloon across the street, which, naturally, was far more lively. 

I reckon you could shoot a cannon down Main Street at high noon and only risk hitting a stray dog or a politician trying to look busy. Speaking of which, the politicians in Carson! Bless their well-meaning, but thoroughly bewildered, hearts. They debated matters of profound importance – like whether the territorial seal should depict a more fearsome rattlesnake – with the gravity of men deciding the fate of nations. Meanwhile, the real business, the wheeling and dealing with silver mines and land grabs, happened in the back rooms of the saloons, fuelled by bad whiskey and even worse cigars.

The air hung thick with dust, the scent of sagebrush, and the faint aroma of unfulfilled dreams. You’d see prospectors shuffling about, their eyes still gleaming with the glint of gold they never found, clutching maps as old as the hills themselves. They were a hopeful bunch, or maybe just a stubborn one. And the ladies! Well, they were a sight to behold, some dressed in the finest silks they could afford, trying to maintain a semblance of civilization amid the chaos, others opting for a more practical, lets-get-down-to-business attire. All in all, Carson City was a town perpetually on the cusp of something, be it greatness or utter failure, and frankly, betting on either felt like a gamble as risky as investing in a lead mine. It was a place where fortunes were made and lost quicker than you could say “Eureka!”, a town that was more character than comfort, and more dust than diamonds.
