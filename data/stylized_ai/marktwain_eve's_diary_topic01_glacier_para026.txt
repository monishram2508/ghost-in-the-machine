Now, this glacier, bless its chilly heart, is a sight to behold, if one is partial to looking at things that are mostly white and move slower than a Mississippi steamboat in January. Adam, poor fellow, was struck dumb by it, claimed it was "magnificent." Magnificent! I told him, "Adam, darling, you call everything magnificent! You called that moldy fig magnificent this morning." He just blinked, as usual, but I suspect he agreed with me, deep down where his thoughts are kept chained up.

This glacier is just a colossal heap of ice, you see, a frozen river inching its way down from the hills. It’s grand, I’ll grant you that. Grand like a mountain of laundry that has been sitting there for a month, daring you to fold it. It’s got cracks in it, these blue gashes that look like the world’s biggest, most stubborn frown. Adam nearly tripped over one, muttering about the "geological significance" of crevasses. I told him, "Adam, the significance is you almost broke your neck! Is that significant enough?"

It scrapes the land bare as it goes, gouging out valleys like a mischievous child let loose with a spoon and a bowl of pudding. Imagine the stories this glacier could tell, if glaciers were given to storytelling. Tales of frozen mammoths, of mountains worn down to pebbles, of eons slipping by like a dream. Alas, it just grunts and groans and occasionally sheds a few tons of ice into the sea, making a terribly unladylike splash. It’s a monument to time and cold indifference, this glacier is. Makes a body feel awfully small, standing next to it, like a gnat trying to understand the constellations. I’d rather have a cup of tea, myself. Though even tea wouldn't last long against the breath of that icy behemoth, I suspect.
