The Bedouin, Arabic for "desert dwellers," are nomadic Arab peoples who have historically inhabited the arid regions of North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Levant. Their existence, deeply interwoven with the harsh desert environment, revolves around animal husbandry, primarily the raising of camels, sheep, and goats. These animals provide essential resources: milk, meat, wool for tents and clothing, and transport across the vast, unforgiving landscapes. Traditional Bedouin society is structured around tribal affiliations, with strong emphasis on lineage, kinship, and honor. Each tribe is further divided into clans and families, bound by shared ancestry and responsibilities. Loyalty to the tribe is paramount, dictating social interactions, resolving disputes, and offering protection in a world where survival depends on collective action. Oral tradition plays a vital role in preserving Bedouin culture. Poetry, storytelling, and genealogies are passed down through generations, maintaining tribal history, values, and customary laws. Hospitality is a cornerstone of Bedouin ethics, where welcoming and providing for guests, even strangers, is considered a sacred duty. This generosity stems from the recognition of shared vulnerability in a challenging environment and the importance of reciprocal aid.

Traditionally, the Bedouin moved with the seasons, following sparse rainfall and vegetation to provide sustenance for their herds. Their nomadic lifestyle demanded resilience, adaptability, and an intimate knowledge of the desert's secrets, including water sources, navigation by the stars, and the ability to predict weather patterns. Over time, the pressures of modernization, including sedentarization programs, urbanization, and the discovery of oil resources in their traditional territories, have significantly altered the Bedouin way of life. Many have transitioned to settled agriculture, urban employment, or service in the military and other government sectors. Despite these changes, a strong sense of Bedouin identity persists, and efforts are being made to preserve their cultural heritage, including traditional crafts, music, and language, to ensure that the rich legacy of the "children of the desert" continues to thrive in a rapidly changing world. Though their nomadic lifestyle is increasingly constrained, the spirit of independence, resilience, and deep connection to the desert remains a defining characteristic of the Bedouin people.
