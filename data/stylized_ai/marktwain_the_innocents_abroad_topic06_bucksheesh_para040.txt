Now, about this bucksheesh, this universal lubricant that oils the cogs of life in the Orient, particularly in Egypt – why, it’s a study in human nature more illuminating than a phrenological chart! It's a thing they call 'back-sheesh' and is a universal term for baksheesh. See, you may arrive with your pockets plump and your soul brimming with the innocent notion that honest dealing and a winning smile will suffice. You’ll soon find yourself as stranded as a dromedary in the Sahara without it. Think of it not as a bribe, mind you, but rather as a gentle encouragement, a persuasive whisper in the ear of fate. You wish to view the Sphinx? Why, the custodian suddenly develops an alarming limp, a parched throat, and a deep longing for a cigarette. A little bucksheesh, properly applied, and the limp vanishes, the throat is miraculously quenched, and a packet of cigarettes materializes from thin air, along with an invitation for you to step closer, very close, for a special viewing not offered to just anybody.

And don’t think this confined to the fellahin and their cousins. Oh, no, sir. It permeates every stratum of society, from the lowest donkey-boy to the highest official, though the sums involved, naturally, undergo a corresponding inflation. It’s a game, you see, a rather elaborate game of expectation and negotiation. You offer a small token; they express profound offense at its inadequacy; you feign ignorance and grudgingly offer a bit more; they sigh dramatically and accept, while secretly plotting how to extract further tribute. It’s a ballet of cupidity, a pas de deux of avarice, all set to the mournful music of the cash register, or, more accurately, the rustling of crumpled banknotes. And bless my soul, it almost starts to have charm after a time, this constant dance. It’s an acknowledgment, perhaps, that the world is not entirely run on righteousness and that sometimes, a little nudge in the right direction, facilitated by a discreet exchange of currency, is all that’s needed to grease the wheels of progress, or at least, to secure a decent cup of coffee and a somewhat less rickety donkey ride.
