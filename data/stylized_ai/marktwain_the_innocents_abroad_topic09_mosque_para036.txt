Now, a mosque, you see, is a rather peculiar sort of edifice, not unlike a church, mind you, but with a decided oriental flair. It's generally got these minarets, slender towers poking at the sky like accusing fingers, from which some fellow with a voice that could curdle milk yells out the call to prayer five times a day. A fellow I imagine is quite popular with the neighborhood dogs, who undoubtedly feel compelled to join in the chorus, resulting in a symphony of pious caterwauling that would drive a deacon to drink. Inside, it’s a grand, open space, usually bereft of pews or chairs, a curious omission considering the lengthy periods of genuflection involved. Imagine, standing up and kneeling down, up and down, five times a day! A fellow’s knees would be complaining louder than a politician caught with his hand in the till, I reckon. 

The floors, invariably covered in carpets that look like they were woven by a thousand Persian fairies with sore fingers, are where the true action happens. Men, and it's mostly men, I must say, line up in neat rows, facing towards Mecca, that fabled city where, I’m told, the coffee is strong and the bargaining fierce. They bow and prostrate themselves with a dedication that puts a revivalist preacher to shame. It’s a sight to behold, this unified submission, though one can't help but wonder if they’re all thinking the same thing. Perhaps they're pondering the price of dates at the market, or lamenting the latest cricket score. One can only imagine the thoughts simmering beneath those devoutly bowed heads, a mixture of piety and, no doubt, a healthy dose of everyday human concerns. A place, I must say, that’s both reverent and riddled with the charming absurdities of human nature, just like any other house of worship, or, indeed, just like life itself.
