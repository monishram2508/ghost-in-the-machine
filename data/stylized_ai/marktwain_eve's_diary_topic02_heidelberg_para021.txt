Heidelberg, bless its picturesque heart, is the sort of town a man might conjure in a dream, a dream possibly induced by a surfeit of Rhine wine. Imagine, if you will, a city draped across the neck of a green hill, the sort of hill that practically begs to be painted on a biscuit tin. And atop this hill, perched like a magnificent, crumbling pastry, sits the Schloss. Now, this Schloss, they say, has been burnt and rebuilt and pillaged so many times it’s a wonder there's any stone left standing at all. The Germans, God love ‘em, are nothing if not persistent about rebuilding what gets blown to smithereens – though I suspect half of them are secretly hoping for another good fire, just to have another go at architecture. The town itself is a charming jumble of cobblestones and half-timbered houses, so crooked they seem to lean in conspiratorially to share gossip. You could lose yourself in its narrow lanes for days, which I did, and found myself, invariably, back at the university. Ah, the university! The fountain of German intellect, or so they'd have you believe. It's full of young men puffing on pipes and contemplating the profundities of philosophy, or at least, that's what they pretend to be doing. The real intellectual pursuit seems to be perfecting the art of student pranks, judging by the tales I heard. They have a student prison, you see, where they lock up the rowdies. I daresay, if I were a student there, I'd have earned myself a life sentence by now, just for the sheer entertainment value of it all. And, of course, one can't forget the Neckar River, lazily winding its way through the valley, a silvery ribbon tying the whole charming scene together. All in all, Heidelberg is a pleasant illusion, a postcard come to life, and I suspect the only reason I left was that my boots were starting to complain about all those confounded cobblestones.
