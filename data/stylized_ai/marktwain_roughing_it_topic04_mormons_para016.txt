Well, I did spend a spell out yonder in Utah Territory, and got a fair squint at them Mormons. A singular lot, to be sure, like a flock of sheep driven by a prophet with a particularly persuasive crook. Salt Lake City, they’ve built it up into a right smart looking place, blooming in the desert like a cactus flower – if a cactus flower had brick buildings and a tabernacle that could swallow a steamboat whole. They're industrious, I'll grant them that, always buzzing about like bees with a mission. And clean! Why, I near choked on the lack of dust when I first set foot in the place. I suspect they sweep the streets with toothbrushes and scrub the clouds with lye soap.

Their Prophet, Brigham Young, now he was a character. Looked like a cross between a granite mountain and a kindly schoolmaster, with eyes that could bore a hole through a wagon wheel. I never rightly understood their religion, all that talk of golden plates and angels in knee-breeches, sounded like something a feller’d dream up after too much mescal. But I reckon if believing that stuff keeps a man honest and sober, and keeps his garden weeded, well, who am I to judge? The women, bless their hearts, always looked a bit harried to me. Imagine trying to keep track of a husband with wives like a fella keeps cows! Some said they were happy as clams, others looked like they'd rather be herding tumbleweeds. I never could figure out which was the truth. And the children! Lord, they multiplied like rabbits after a spring rain. Everywhere you turned, there was a gaggle of them, bright-eyed and eager, no doubt preparing for a future of tithing and temple work. All in all, the Mormons are a curious bunch, a blend of piety and practicality, faith and farming, that I daresay you won't find anywhere else this side of the Mississippi. A strange and wondrous experiment, indeed, and one that'll keep a fella scratching his head for many a dusty mile.
