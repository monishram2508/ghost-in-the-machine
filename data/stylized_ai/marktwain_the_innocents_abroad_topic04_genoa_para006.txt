Genoa, ah, Genoa! A city clinging to the Ligurian coast like a barnacle on a dreadnought, a place so ancient, I half expected to see Noah disembarking with a disgruntled giraffe in tow. One ventures into its maze of caruggi, those narrow, cobbled alleyways that seem designed to confound the visitor and delight the pickpocket, and finds oneself utterly lost within minutes. 'Tis a city that surely predates the invention of the straight line, for I swear I've never seen such a delightful, nay, fiendish disregard for geometry. Buildings lean against each other for support, whispering secrets perhaps about long-dead Doges and questionable spice trades. Laundry hangs overhead like banners celebrating some obscure victory of the common folk over the forces of cleanliness.

The grand palaces, however, stand shoulder to shoulder along Via Garibaldi, oozing wealth and history like overripe gorgonzola. One can almost imagine the haughty Genoese aristocrats, their noses pointed skyward, as they surveyed their domains, oblivious to the scurrying masses below. Indeed, one feels somewhat intrusive gawking at their former splendor, as if peering through the keyhole of a particularly opulent past. But gawking one must, for the artwork and architecture within are truly impressive, even if one secretly suspects that half the gold leaf was acquired through methods that wouldn't bear too close an investigation. And then there’s the harbor, a bustling cauldron of commerce where fishing boats bob alongside enormous container ships, a testament to Genoa’s enduring role as a trading hub. The air is thick with the scent of salt, diesel, and something vaguely fishy, a combination that, whilst not entirely pleasant, possesses a certain undeniable authenticity. The whole place is a delightful jumble, a chaotic symphony of sights, sounds, and smells that assaults the senses and leaves one feeling thoroughly, wonderfully disoriented. One half expects to stumble upon Columbus himself, haggling over the price of cinnamon before setting sail for the New World, undoubtedly getting utterly lost on the way.
