Baden, ah, Baden! A place where one could observe humanity in all its gilded absurdity, a veritable circus of fashion and folly. You see, it's the sort of town where dukes and duchesses, along with sundry other luminaries of dubious character, congregate to… well, to congregate, mostly. They saunter along the Lichtentaler Allee, those grand avenues lined with trees so perfectly manicured they appear to have consulted a barber, exchanging vapid pleasantries and flashing diamond brooches like signals across a battlefield. The air itself practically drips with eau de cologne and the faint scent of scandal, a heady brew for a humble observer such as myself. The waters, they say, possess curative properties, though I suspect the chief cure they offer is for an overabundance of coin. One simply hemorrhages funds at the casino with such gleeful abandon that by evening one is feeling lightheaded enough to swear they've grown younger.

And the conversations! Oh, the conversations are masterpieces of artful evasion. One might inquire about the health of a particularly sickly-looking prince, only to receive a twenty-minute discourse on the latest advancements in poodle grooming. It's a grand dance of pretense, where everyone is playing a role and no one is quite certain what play they're in. There's a certain charm, mind you, to the sheer, unadulterated artifice of it all. It’s like watching a particularly elaborate marionette show, only the strings are made of money and the puppets are terribly convinced of their own significance. I saw one lady, draped in so many jewels she resembled a walking jewelry store, complain bitterly about the lack of champagne at breakfast. I swear, the heavens themselves must have chuckled at that. Baden, you see, is a place where life imitates caricature, and the result is often far more entertaining than anything one could invent.
