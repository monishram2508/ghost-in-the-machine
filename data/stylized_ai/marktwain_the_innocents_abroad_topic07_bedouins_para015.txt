Now, the Bedouin, bless their wandering souls, is a creature quite unlike anything you'd find squawking on a Wall Street exchange. They're a breed apart, these Arabs of the desert, leaner than a miser's smile and tougher than a camel's hide after a sandstorm. I saw 'em myself, you understand, whilst gallivanting about the Holy Land, dodging locusts and fervent preachers aplenty. They drift across the sandy wastes with a grace that puts your best waltz to shame, their tents springing up and vanishing like mirages, which, I suspect, they occasionally use for navigation.

You see 'em draped in their flowing robes, looking for all the world like Old Testament prophets who’d lost their way to the promised land and decided, ‘Well, this dune looks comfy enough.’ Don't let the solemn demeanor fool you though, they’re sharper than a pawnbroker’s eye when it comes to horse-trading, or, more accurately, camel-trading. They'll haggle over the price of a mangy goat like it was the crown jewels, and by the time the deal is done, you'll be convinced you've been thoroughly fleeced, only to discover they somehow managed to sell you more goat than you initially asked for.

Their hospitality, though, is a marvel, I must say. Offer them a cup of coffee and they'll drown you in it, black as a preacher’s heart and strong enough to resurrect the dead. Though, mind you, they might also try to marry you off to their daughter afterward, which, depending on the daughter and your marital status, could be either a blessing or a curse. They possess a poetry to their existence, these nomads, a harmony with the harsh land they call home. Yet, in that harmony, there's a persistent gleam in their eyes, hinting that they wouldn’t hesitate to sell you that poetry, beautifully bound in goat-skin, for the right price, which, naturally, you’ll have to haggle down to the last grain of sand.
