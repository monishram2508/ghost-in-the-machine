Now, about this mosque, this grand edifice of devotion they call it. One can't help but notice it looming large upon the horizon, a veritable mountain of brick and mortar pointing a finger skyward, presumably telling the Almighty, "Look at this, look what we built for You!" And I reckon the Almighty, being the understanding sort, probably just chuckles and says, "Well, ain't that something?" They do go in for the ornamentation, I must admit. Domes that gleam like polished brass kettles, minarets that threaten to poke holes in the heavens themselves, and enough intricate carvings to keep a whole army of stonemasons busy for a millennium.

Inside, it’s all cool marble and hushed tones, a welcome respite from the dust and din of the earthly realm. I observed folks shuffling in and out, some looking remarkably pious, others, if I dare say, looking like they'd rather be somewhere else entirely, perhaps wrestling a particularly stubborn mule. They all perform their ablutions with a solemnity that would make a Roman senator proud, washing their hands and feet as if trying to scrub away all the earthly sins they'd collected during the day.

Then comes the praying, of course. A rhythmic bowing and scraping that, from an outsider’s perspective, looks a bit like a flock of well-trained pigeons following the commands of their leader. No disrespect intended, mind you. It's just that human beings, in their fervent devotion, can sometimes resemble the most curious of God's creatures. And that Imam, now there's a fellow who can bellow! He chants and sings and preaches with a voice that could wake the dead, and probably does, on occasion, judging by the startled looks on some of the congregants’ faces.

And when it's all said and done, they file out, back into the hustle and bustle of life, presumably a little bit closer to salvation, or at least a little bit cleaner around the ankles. It’s a curious spectacle, this religious business. Full of earnestness, tradition, and just a touch of the ridiculous. But then again, isn't everything?
