Higbie, now there's a name that'll curdle your milk if you ain't used to dealing with the peculiar specimens this desert country breeds. He was a shiftless sort, Higbie was, a prospector who’d spent more time leaning on his shovel than swinging it, and more time spinning yarns than separating gold from gravel. He hailed from, well, somewhere east, I reckon, though he never specified the exact location. Probably best left unsaid; might stain the reputation of a perfectly respectable state. Anyway, Higbie possessed a knack for making a dollar look like a dime after it passed through his greasy paws. Always scheming, always concocting some grand plan to strike it rich, and always failing miserably. You could set your watch by his failures.

He was a walking encyclopedia of misinformation, spouting off about geology and mineralogy with the confidence of a seasoned scientist, despite never cracking a book in his life. He’d tell you how to find a silver vein with the same conviction he'd tell you the moon was made of cheese. And bless your heart if you dared to question him; he’d launch into a convoluted explanation that would tie your brain in knots faster than you could say "bullion." He was a master of elaborate fabrications, a veritable word-smith of the improbable.

Yet, for all his failings and flagrant disregard for the truth, you couldn’t help but like the old coot. There was a certain charm to his audacity, a certain endearing quality to his relentless optimism in the face of utter disaster. He was the kind of fellow who’d borrow your last dollar, lose it in a poker game, and then convince you that it was an investment in his future and therefore, by some twisted logic, an investment in yours as well. Higbie, you see, was a genuine article, a specimen of the West as authentic as a desert rattler or a sun-baked skull. And even though he was a walking disaster, he was *our* disaster. And sometimes, that's all that mattered.
