Now, this glacier, bless its slow-moving heart, it’s a spectacle fit for a queen, though I wager even Her Majesty would find herself tapping her foot waiting for it to pick up the pace. Imagine, if you will, a river of ice, only instead of gurgling merrily along, it grinds and groans and creaks like a spinster lady adjusting her corset after a rather robust luncheon. It’s blue, in places, a shade that would make a robin's egg blush with envy, and then gray, all gritty and glum with the dirt it’s been hoarding for centuries – probably misplaced things folks dropped eons ago! I saw a chap yesterday swore he spotted a Viking longboat poking out of the side, but I suspect his tonic water might have been a tad too liberally applied.

They tell you it’s a fearsome agent of erosion, carving out valleys and shaping mountains. And I dare say it is, but doing so at a speed that would shame a snail. Why, you could knit yourself a whole tea cozy before that thing shaves off a pebble from yon peak. It’s a lazy beast, I tell you, but in a grand, majestic sort of way. Like a sleeping giant that occasionally shifts in its sleep, sending a cascade of rocks rattling down the mountainside just to keep the tourists awake. And the scientists? Well, they’re a curious lot, clambering about with their little hammers and measuring tapes, trying to decipher the glacier’s secrets. As if that frozen behemoth is going to divulge its innermost thoughts! More likely, it’s just chuckling to itself, watching those busy ants fussing about, knowing full well it’ll outlive them all, and probably their great-great-grandchildren too. Ah, the vanity of glaciers! It’s enough to make a body reconsider investing in warmer mittens, though I fully expect to be dead and buried before the ice decides to pay my bones a visit.
