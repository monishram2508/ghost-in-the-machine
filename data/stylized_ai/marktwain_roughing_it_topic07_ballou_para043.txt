Ballou, now there was a specimen. A tenderfoot of the purest ray serene, fresh-baked from some Eastern academy where they taught Latin poetry and the proper way to hold a tea-cup, but precious little about the brutal realities of Nevada Territory. He arrived with luggage enough to stock a small dry-goods store, trunks bulging with starched collars, velvet slippers, and books that would make a preacher blush with their lofty pronouncements on civilized living. He fancied himself a prospector, did Ballou, envisioning nuggets the size of hen's eggs practically leaping into his eager hands. Lord love a duck, he couldn’t tell a quartz vein from a garter snake! 

I reckon he spent more time polishing his spectacles than panning for gold. We tried, God knows we tried, to teach him the basics: how to swing a pick without braining himself, how to tell a grizzly bear from a friendly Saint Bernard, how to chew tobacco without lookin’ like he was tryin’ to swallow a runaway mule. But it was like tryin’ to hammer sense into a granite boulder. His hands, so delicate and lily-white, blistered at the mere sight of a shovel. He’d complain about the dust, the heat, the flies, everything but the fact that he hadn't turned up a single speck of pay dirt. 

One time, he even tried to bargain with a group of Paiute Indians using Shakespearean sonnets. I swear, I nearly choked on my coffee. The Indians, bless their cotton socks, looked at him like he’d sprouted a second head and offered him a handful of dried grass in return, which Ballou promptly took as a sign of respect and a demonstration of shared cultural understanding. He’d then scribble furiously in his journal, likely recording observations about the noble savage and his profound appreciation for iambic pentameter. Honestly, the man was a walking, talking encyclopedia of misapplied learning. He was a constant source of amusement, though, a living, breathing example of how much book learnin’ ain’t worth a pinch of dust when you're facin’ down the real world. We all secretly hoped he’d strike it rich just to see the look on his face, but mostly, we were just glad to have him around for the laughs. A genuine curiosity, Ballou, and a testament to the sheer, unadulterated innocence that could still exist, even in the wickedest corners of the West.
