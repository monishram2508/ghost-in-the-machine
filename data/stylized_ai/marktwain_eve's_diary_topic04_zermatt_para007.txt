Zermatt, you see, is a place that takes itself quite seriously, and why shouldn't it? Perched precariously beneath the Matterhorn, that grand, granite thumb pointed at the heavens, it has a view to rival any king's ransom. A view, I might add, that the king would likely never get to see, not unless he traded his throne for a pair of sturdy boots and a hankering for thin air. The village itself is a delightful paradox. Imagine, if you will, a place utterly crammed with charm and yet steadfastly determined to remain untainted by the twentieth century, never mind the twenty-first. No automobiles allowed, they declare, which is all well and good until you're lugging a steamer trunk filled with enough finery to outfit a small opera house up a cobbled street so steep it would make a goat dizzy. Then, the charm wears a bit thin, I confess. The transportation of choice, naturally, is the electric cart, driven by swarthy Swiss fellows who seem to regard pedestrians as moving chicanes, a mildly amusing obstacle course on their daily rounds. One can hardly blame them, though; the air is bracing, the sun dazzling, and the whole place exudes an air of self-importance so potent you could spread it on a cracker. The tourists, of course, are a sight to behold, swathed in enough Gore-Tex to repel a monsoon, armed with cameras the size of small cannons, all eager to capture that perfect shot of the Matterhorn. They throng the streets, a veritable army of well-heeled explorers, determined to conquer not the mountain itself, mind you, but the souvenir shops and fondue restaurants that line its base. And bless their hearts, they seem to find it an utterly thrilling victory, worthy of endless bragging rights back in Hoboken. Zermatt, in short, is a spectacle. A dazzling, ridiculous, utterly irresistible spectacle. One that, I suspect, will continue to amuse and amaze for centuries to come, even if half the pleasure lies in watching other people being utterly bewildered by it all.
