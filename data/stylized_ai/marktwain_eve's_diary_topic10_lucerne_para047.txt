Lucerne, you see, is a place that strikes you as being altogether too… perfect. Like a picture postcard come to life, though I’ve never quite understood the human impulse to capture perfection on a card and send it somewhere else. Seems an awful pity to diminish the original, wouldn’t you say? The lake, as blue as a sapphire dipped in the heavens, reflects the Alps with such unwavering fidelity, one almost expects the mountains to leap in and join their watery doppelgangers for a bit of a lark. The town itself is laid out with the sort of meticulousness that suggests a committee of very serious, very precise gnomes had a hand in its creation. Not a crooked cobblestone to be found, and the buildings, painted in hues so cheerful they border on aggressive optimism, stand shoulder to shoulder like well-behaved children in a school portrait.

The people, well, they are just as orderly. Mannerly to a fault, and so remarkably polite that one suspects they've all swallowed a manual on Swiss etiquette from birth. You won’t catch them jaywalking, or haggling over the price of a cuckoo clock (though I imagine they manufacture more of those contraptions in this area than God invented different kinds of cheese). I observed a chap dropping a small piece of paper and, before I could even offer the slightest assistance, he retrieved it with an alacrity that suggested he’d committed a grave moral transgression. He then deposited it, not a moment too soon, into one of those pristine, precisely placed waste receptacles that could probably pass a cleanliness inspection conducted by angels. It's all rather… admirable, I suppose, but somehow lacking in the delightful imperfections that make life, and other places, so wonderfully interesting. It's like biting into a perfectly crafted marzipan fruit, only to discover that underneath the flawless exterior lies nothing but… more marzipan. One longs for a little bit of grit, a little bit of chaos, a pigeon daring to deface a monument, perhaps. But alas, in Lucerne, even the pigeons seem to be operating under strict instructions.
