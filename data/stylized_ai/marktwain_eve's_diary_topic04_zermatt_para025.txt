Zermatt, you say? Why, it’s just another one of those Alpine contraptions, all peaks and precipices and preposterous prices. A fellow can hardly turn around without bumping into a cow, or worse, a tourist dressed like they’re about to assault Everest. And the Matterhorn, bless its pointy little heart, is forever playing coy, shrouded in fog one minute, brazenly showing off the next. One half expects it to start winking. The air, of course, is crisp and clean – a decided improvement over the smoky dens of London, though one does find oneself panting like a dog after a particularly vigorous game of fetch. They've banned the motorcars, you see, which sounds delightful in theory, conjuring images of peaceful promenades and the gentle clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages. The reality, however, involves being harassed by electric carts driven by men who look like they’ve been sucking lemons since breakfast, and who seem determined to run you down should you dawdle on the cobblestones.

The locals, they're a curious lot, perpetually cheerful in that maddening, Swiss sort of way. One suspects they’re hiding something, perhaps the location of a secret stash of chocolate, or the formula for eternal youth. They certainly seem to thrive on a diet of cheese and potatoes, a notion that fills this humble narrator with both envy and a profound sense of impending gout. As for the skiing, well, that's where the real money goes. Downhill is a thrill, I suppose, for those who enjoy hurtling themselves down icy slopes with nothing but two planks and a prayer. I prefer the more contemplative sport of watching others do it, preferably from a fireside chair with a glass of something warming in my hand. All in all, Zermatt is a spectacle, a charming and slightly absurd exercise in mountain-induced madness. Go if you must, but be warned: you'll leave both poorer and more acutely aware of your own mortality. And likely with a craving for cheese fondue you can’t quite explain.
