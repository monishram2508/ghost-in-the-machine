Pard, now there's a word that'll stick in your craw like a poorly aimed chaw of tobacco. It's used out here in Nevada like some folks use "sir" back East, all smooth and dripping with honey, but don't you be fooled. Half the time, the fella callin' you "pard" is figurin' out how best to relieve you of your poke, or maybe your horse, or perhaps just your last crumb of hardtack. Seen it happen more times than I've seen squirrels bury nuts in the fall.

Take ol' Jebediah, fer instance. Jeb was a "pard" to everyone he met, slapped 'em on the back, bought 'em a drink (if they were buying the next round), and listened to their woes with a sympathy that could melt granite. But Jebediah was also a cardsharp slicker than a greased pig at a county fair. He'd be all "Howdy, pard!" while simultaneously palming an ace up his sleeve and sizing up your watch chain. Never trusted a man who used "pard" too freely, that's my motto. It's like them fellas who grin too much; bet your boots they're hidin' somethin' behind that pearly façade. 

But then again, sometimes, just sometimes, you'd meet a fella who meant it. A fella who’d share his last blanket on a cold night, or pull you outta a tight spot without expectin' nothin' in return. Maybe he truly saw you as a companion, a fellow traveler on this dusty, ornery road to nowhere. And in them cases, "pard" wasn't just a word; it was a bond, a unspoken agreement to look out for each other in a land where the only thing predictable was the unpredictability of it all. Still, even then, I’d keep one eye on my wallet. Learned that lesson the hard way, I reckon. Though, I suppose, if you're going to be fleeced, it might as well be by a fella who calls you "pard." Makes the medicine go down a little easier, don't it?
