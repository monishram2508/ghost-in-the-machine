Galilee, bless its simple, sun-baked soul, is a land that wears its history like a threadbare coat, patched with olive groves and held together by the Sea, which isn’t so much a sea as a rather ambitious lake, truth be told. They call it the Sea of Galilee, mind you, probably to impress the tourists and fishermen alike, but I've seen puddles bigger after a decent rain in Missouri. The locals, bless their industrious hearts, still eke out a living from its lukewarm waters, casting their nets for fish that, while reasonably tasty when fried with enough garlic and a dash of questionable oil, aren’t exactly going to set the culinary world ablaze. They’ll tell you tales of miracles performed upon its shores, of course – walking on water, feeding multitudes with a handful of biscuits and a few undersized sardines, quieting storms with a stern word – things that would make a patent medicine salesman blush. I suppose it’s all in the interpretation. A man could easily slip on some slimy algae, misjudge the tide, or simply be a master illusionist. Either way, the stories linger, clinging to the air like the scent of orange blossoms, thick and sweet.

The towns, Capernaum and Tiberias being prime examples, are a charming jumble of ancient ruins and modern kitsch, the sacred bumping elbows with the secular in a fashion that would raise eyebrows in a proper Victorian parlor. You can admire the supposed site of a miracle one minute, and then haggle over a carved olive wood camel the next. The whole region is a delightful study in contrasts: the stark beauty of the arid hills against the vibrant blues and greens of the valley; the earnest piety of the pilgrims rubbing shoulders with the shrewdness of the merchants; the timeless rhythm of the farming life disrupted only by the occasional tour bus roaring past, laden with camera-toting pilgrims eager to snap a picture of something, anything, that they can claim is authentically biblical. It's a land that invites contemplation, if only to ponder how so much history, myth, and questionable merchandising could be crammed into such a relatively small space. You'll leave with a tan, a full belly, and a healthy dose of skepticism, which, in my humble opinion, is about the best souvenir a traveler can hope for.
