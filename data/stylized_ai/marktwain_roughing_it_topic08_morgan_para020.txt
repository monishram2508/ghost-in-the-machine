Now, Morgan, there was a specimen. Not the sort you'd find pickin’ gold from a creek bed, mind you, though I reckon he'd be just as comfortable bossin' the creek as he would be orchestratin’ a railroad empire. This Morgan fellow, he was a picture of respectable villainy, dressed finer than a Sunday preacher and just about as likely to be honest with you. He was a man of appetites, you see, and by appetites, I don't mean just for grub and giggle-water, though I suspect he partook with gusto there as well. No, his hunger was for influence, for power that rippled out like a dropped stone in a millpond, chokin’ the small fish and leavin’ him king of the water.

He was a study in contrasts, was Morgan. Could charm a banker into loaning him the sun, the moon, and the stars, then turn around and squeeze a widow out of her last dime with a smile so sweet you'd think he was doing *her* the favor. He had a way of looking at a man, not *through* him like some of your fancy philosophers, but *at* him, like a butcher eyeing a prize hog. You knew, deep down, that he was assessin' your worth, calculatin' how best to use you, be it as a stepping stone or a speed bump, all with that infuriatingly polite demeanor. He collected railroads and art treasures with equal abandon, probably couldn’t tell the difference between a Renaissance masterpiece and a picture ripped out of a dime novel, but knew dang well both had value. The art made him respectable, the railroads made him rich, and the respectability made him richer. A perfect, self-perpetuating system, like a snake swallowin' its own tail, only with a lot more zeros involved. They said he was a genius, those Eastern fellas. Maybe so. But a genius for what? For accumulating more coin than any one man could reasonably spend in a thousand lifetimes? Seems a bit wasteful, if you ask me. But nobody ever did.
