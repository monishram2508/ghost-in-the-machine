Mormons, formally known as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, represent a distinct religious tradition that emerged in the United States during the 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith in 1830, Mormonism is characterized by a unique blend of Christian beliefs, additional scriptures, and a strong emphasis on communal living and missionary work. Central to their faith is the Book of Mormon, which they believe to be a companion scripture to the Bible, detailing God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. This scripture, along with the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, supplements the Bible and provides further guidance for Latter-day Saints. One of the defining aspects of Mormonism is its restorationist theology, the belief that the original church established by Jesus Christ was lost and that Joseph Smith was chosen to restore it to its fullness. This restoration includes the reestablishment of priesthood authority and the administration of sacred ordinances, such as baptism for the dead and temple sealings. Historically, Mormonism faced significant persecution and displacement, leading to the establishment of Salt Lake City, Utah, as its headquarters. This history of persecution fostered a strong sense of community and self-reliance among members. Today, the church boasts a global membership of over 16 million, spread across numerous countries. Mormon missionaries, typically young adults, voluntarily dedicate a significant portion of their lives to proselyting and sharing their beliefs. While holding many core Christian beliefs in common with other denominations, Mormonism maintains unique theological perspectives, including a belief in a Heavenly Mother, the potential for human deification, and a pre-mortal existence. These distinctive doctrines, coupled with their historical narrative and cultural practices, contribute to the unique identity of the Mormon faith within the broader landscape of Christianity. While controversial at times, the Mormon church remains a prominent and influential religious force.
