Harris, that specimen of misguided enthusiasm, fancies himself a man of the world, a veritable Magellan of the domestic sphere. He's got this habit, you see, of offering advice on matters he understands about as well as a pig understands celestial navigation. He comes bustling in, all elbows and misplaced confidence, declaring, “Eve, my dear, I've solved the dilemma of the perpetually drooping geranium!” as if he’d just deciphered the Rosetta Stone. And his solutions, bless his heart, are generally along the lines of transplanting the poor thing into a boot or watering it with tea, claiming some obscure anecdotal evidence from a distant relative thrice removed who once grew prize-winning turnips in a disused chamber pot.

He possesses, I suspect, a deep-seated yearning to be seen as the font of all wisdom, a veritable oracle dispensed in tweed and pipe smoke. But the truth of the matter is, he's more like a leaky faucet dispensing drops of questionable advice that mostly just dampens the surrounding area. He's also prone to elaborate explanations, delivered with the gravitas of a Supreme Court Justice, about topics that barely warrant a footnote in the annals of human endeavor. Last week, for instance, I endured a twenty-minute dissertation on the optimal method for stacking firewood, complete with hand-drawn diagrams and a comparison to the architectural marvels of ancient Rome. The actual firewood, mind you, remained in a chaotic heap, mocking his theories with its sheer, unadulterated disarray. Yet, despite his persistent, well-intentioned bungling, one cannot help but feel a certain affection for the man. He’s a walking, talking advertisement for the proposition that good intentions, however misguided, are still worth something, even if that something is merely a source of amusement and a good, long laugh. After all, a life without a Harris or two would be a terribly dull affair indeed, like a circus without the clowns, or a marriage without the… well, let's just say a little comic relief is always welcome.
