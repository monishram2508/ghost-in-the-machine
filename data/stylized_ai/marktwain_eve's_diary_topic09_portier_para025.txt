Now, about this portier, which I reckon you call a "portiere" nowadays, all fancy and Frenchified. A portier, in my humble opinion, is nothing more than a curtain what thinks it's too good for the window. It hangs there, all heavy and brocaded, like a dowager aunt at a picnic, blocking drafts and pretending it’s guarding secrets of profound importance. As if a bit of fabric could keep the cat from sneaking into the parlor to bat about with your finest china, or prevent gossip from floating right through the keyhole.

You see 'em most often in doorways, particularly between the parlor and the hall, where they’re supposed to be adding a touch of elegance, I suppose. Elegance, mind you, usually achieved by accumulating enough dust bunnies to start a small colony under the hem. They sway in the breeze like ghosts who’ve forgotten where they put their spectacles, whispering stories only moths can decipher. And heavens to Betsy, the trouble they cause! You’re forever tripping over ‘em, especially after a glass of sherry or two. A man could break his neck on a portier, I reckon, and the only obituary would be a footnote about the deceased’s unfortunate encounter with “a particularly opulent tapestry.”

The funniest thing, though, is how much store folks set by ‘em. They’ll fret and fume over the color, the fabric, the way it drapes. It's the kind of worrying that could curdle milk. And all for what? To keep out a draft that could just as easily be handled with a properly stuffed sock under the door. But no, we must have the portier, the silent sentinel of domestic tranquility, the fabric façade hiding all the unwashed dishes and unpaid bills from prying eyes. I tell you, a body could write a whole book about the absurdities of civilized life, and the portier would deserve its own chapter, right there alongside the etiquette lessons and the fascination with porcelain cats. A curious contraption, the portier, and a danged sight less useful than a good, sturdy broom.
