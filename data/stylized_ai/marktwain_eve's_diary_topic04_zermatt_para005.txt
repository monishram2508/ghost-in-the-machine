Zermatt, you see, is a place seemingly crafted by the very hand of a benevolent God, one with a penchant for dramatic scenery and a curious aversion to the horseless carriage. Imagine, if you will, a village nestled beneath the imperious gaze of the Matterhorn, a craggy pyramid that seems to have been thrown down by a titan in a fit of pique. The air is so clean, so utterly devoid of the noxious fumes that plague our cities, one almost feels compelled to apologize for each breath taken. It is almost as if the mountains themselves conspire to keep the modernity at bay. One travels in these electric contraptions, the only self-propelled conveyance permitted, and they trundle around like glorified children's toys. Quite charming, I must admit, but hardly the image of progress as championed by the cities.

The inhabitants, bless their hardy souls, appear to have adapted quite well to this curious state of affairs. They are a breed apart, these Swiss mountain folk, possessed of a quiet dignity and an uncanny ability to discern the precise moment a tourist's wallet is ripe for plucking. One cannot help but observe the abundance of watch shops, each window glittering with more timepieces than one could possibly require in a single lifetime. Are they measuring the passage of glacial epochs? Or perhaps simply ensuring that no hapless tourist is late for their overpriced fondue? One can never quite be certain of the Swiss. The hotels are grand, the chalets quaint, and the restaurants offer a bewildering array of dishes featuring melted cheese, the national culinary obsession. They say the cows produce milk laced with Edelweiss nectar. I suspect it is merely clever marketing, but one is compelled to indulge, nonetheless. And of course, skiing! One strap on planks to one's feet, and proceed to throw oneself down the mountain with abandon. An activity, I must confess, that always leaves me feeling somewhat less dignified than the aforementioned titan hurling mountains. Yet, in Zermatt, even humiliation takes on a certain scenic charm.
