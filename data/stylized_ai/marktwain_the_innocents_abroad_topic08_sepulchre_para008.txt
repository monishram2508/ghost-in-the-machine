The sepulchre, now there’s a word that rolls off the tongue like a marble down a staircase, all echo and gloom. One can scarcely utter it without conjuring images of damp, stone walls, cobwebs thick as a stage curtain, and the general air of something desperately wanting to be left alone. Folks build ‘em, you see, these fancy final addresses, not just to keep the rain off poor departed Uncle Silas, but mostly to impress the neighbors, dead or alive. A simple hole in the ground, well, that's democratic, ain't it? But a mausoleum, a veritable above-ground residence for the worm-fodder, ah, that's class. It whispers of lineage, of fortunes amassed and held onto like a badger gripping a root, and of the firm conviction that even death shouldn’t lessen one’s property value.

I’ve seen ‘em grand as palaces, all Corinthian columns and angels with chipped noses, big enough to house a small family, assuming they wouldn’t mind the company. And inside? Why, it's a regular museum of grief and granite! Elaborate inscriptions detailing the deceased's virtues (vastly exaggerated, as a rule), weeping marble women leaning on urns, and enough polished stone to blind a bat at fifty paces. You’d think, with all the effort put into these eternal abodes, that folks would spend more time living a life worthy of such a monument instead of scheming to secure the prime burial plot. But no, that ain't the way of it. They squabble and scratch for every penny while kicking and screaming, then expect to be remembered as saints once they're six feet under, entombed in a monument fit for a king. And then, after a generation or two, the relatives forget where it is, the weeds grow up, the pigeons move in, and the sepulchre becomes just another crumbling pile of rocks, a testament to the fleeting vanity of man and the ultimate triumph of nature’s indifference. It's a right comical thing, when you think about it.
