Higbie, you see, was a character that could sprout from the very heart of a gold mine, thick with dust and smelling faintly of blasted hopes. He wasn't pretty, mind you, no more pretty than a grizzly after a bee sting. Had a face like a well-worn boot, lines etched deep by sun and hardship and, no doubt, more than his fair share of bad whiskey. Claimed to have been everywhere and done everything, though I reckon half of it was likely spun from the fertile ground of his imagination.

This Higbie, he could spin a yarn faster than a spider makes silk. He'd tell you of lost silver lodes shimmering in the moonlight, of rivers running thick with nuggets just waiting to be scooped up, of Indian wars fought single-handedly against a whole tribe armed only with his trusty rifle and a healthy dose of cussedness. And he’d tell it all with such a straight face, you'd almost believe him, even when logic itself was begging you to reconsider.

Now, Higbie wasn’t exactly what you’d call reliable. He was the kind of fellow who’d promise to meet you at dawn, only to show up at noon with a story about how he got sidetracked by a talking badger who needed help finding its lost spectacles. You’d swear he was lying, but then he’d pull out a pair of tiny spectacles and give you such a mournful look, you’d end up feeling sorry for the badger and offering him a share of your lunch.

But, despite his quirks, his tall tales, and his general unreliability, Higbie had a heart of gold, or at least, a heart that glittered with fool’s gold, which is close enough in these parts. He'd share his last crust of bread, help a stranger in need, and always had a kind word, or at least a sardonic joke, for everyone. He was a fixture, that Higbie, a part of the landscape as much as the sagebrush and the jackrabbits, and life in the territory just wouldn't be the same without his presence, however exasperating it might be. He was, in short, a genuine specimen of the West, a human-shaped whirlwind of exaggeration and good intentions, and you couldn't help but love him, even as you were rolling your eyes at his latest preposterous claim.
