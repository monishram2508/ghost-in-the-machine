Gibraltar, bless its diminutive heart, is a sight that fairly tickles the fancy, though perhaps not always in a manner entirely respectful. A mere pimple of rock, stuck like a stubborn barnacle to the nether regions of Spain, it stands as a testament to British tenacity, or perhaps, to British inability to let go of a good thing, depending on one's philosophical bent. One half expects a particularly gruff bulldog to emerge from its craggy face, puffing a pipe and daring any Spaniard to come closer than necessary.

The whole place is a riot of the unexpected. Here you are, basking in the Iberian sun, surrounded by the lilting cadences of Spanish, when suddenly, bangers and mash assaults your nostrils, and the Queen's English, spoken with a certain…*robustness*, fills the air. One might find oneself dodging a rogue taxicab driven by a chap with a Cockney accent who’s just as likely to give you a history lesson on the Napoleonic Wars as he is a receipt. The Barbary macaques, those impudent little simians, are another matter entirely. They are the true lords of this limestone kingdom, and possess a cunning far surpassing that of most politicians I've had the misfortune of encountering. They will steal your sunglasses, your sandwiches, and if given half a chance, likely your very soul. It is whispered they even hold board meetings on the Rock’s highest peak, discussing how best to further their reign of simian terror.

The town itself, a charmingly cluttered affair, is a veritable bazaar of duty-free delights and shops selling the same souvenir t-shirts one can find anywhere from Timbuktu to Tierra del Fuego. But it possesses a certain charm, this peculiar blend of British practicality and Mediterranean nonchalance. And, heavens to Betsy, the views! From the top of that blasted rock, one can see Africa beckoning across the strait, a tantalizing glimpse of the exotic and the unknown. It's enough to make a fellow believe in grand adventures, or at least, to contemplate the purchase of another duty-free bottle of gin. All in all, Gibraltar is a geographical curiosity, a political anachronism, and a truly delightful place to spend an afternoon, provided you keep a firm grip on your belongings, and perhaps, a loaded squirt gun handy for dealing with the aforementioned macaques.
