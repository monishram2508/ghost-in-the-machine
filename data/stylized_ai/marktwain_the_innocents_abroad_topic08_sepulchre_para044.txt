Now, a sepulchre, you see, ain't just a hole in the ground with a headstone propped up like a sleepy man at a revival meeting. No sir, a sepulchre is the highfalutin cousin of a grave, all dressed up in stone and fancy carvings, thinking it's too good to mix with the common dirt. It’s the sort of place a fella would build if he was convinced his soul needed a palatial residence in the afterlife, a veritable Fifth Avenue address amongst the dearly departed. Folks will tell you it’s about honoring the dead, and maybe there’s a sliver of truth in that, small enough to choke a gnat, but I reckon it's mostly about showing off while you still can. "Look at me," it screams silently, "I was important enough to warrant this miniature mausoleum, and you’re stuck with a measly patch of grass!"

You'll find 'em in the older graveyards, these sepulchres, standing like proud, weathered sentinels, guarding secrets long forgotten. Often, they’re overgrown with ivy, moss, and a general air of neglect that suggests even death eventually gets bored with its opulent surroundings. I’ve seen some that were grand enough to house a small family, though I suspect the family residing within now are mostly bones and dust, sharing the space with the occasional opportunistic spider. And the inscriptions! Land sakes, the inscriptions! Lengthy, self-congratulatory pronouncements about the deceased's virtues and accomplishments, worded as if they were written by the fellow himself before he kicked the bucket, which, come to think of it, they probably were. It's all a bit like a politician's eulogy, full of flowery language and exaggerations that would make even a catfish blush. A sepulchre, you see, is a testament to human vanity, a stone cold reminder that even in death, some folks are determined to maintain their social standing, forever separated from the hoi polloi, even if they are all resting six feet under the same old dirt.
