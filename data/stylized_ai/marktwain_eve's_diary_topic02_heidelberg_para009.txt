Heidelberg, they call it a city, though “picturesque arrangement of houses clinging to a hillside like ivy on a ruin” would be closer to the mark. The river Neckar, a saucy, gurgling wench of a river, meanders through the valley, flirting with the reflection of the old bridge. One must pay a groat to cross that bridge, a sum that might bankrupt a man if he were in the habit of visiting the Apothecary often enough to require daily crossings. And speaking of apothecaries, judging by the number of gaunt-looking students shuffling about, Heidelberg’s pharmacists must be swimming in gold, like so many carp in a gilded pond. The students, bless their bookish hearts, are a breed apart. They carry their dueling scars with the pride a peacock shows its tail feathers, though, from what I've gathered, most of their fights involve more theatrical flourish than actual bodily harm. One can hardly swing a cat without hitting a student, a professor, or a souvenir shop hawking cuckoo clocks and painted beer steins. Now, the castle! Ah, the Heidelberg Castle. A magnificent ruin, it is, perched atop the hill like a crown askew. One can wander through its crumbling walls, imagining the pomp and circumstance of bygone eras, or, more likely, dodging the hordes of tourists snapping photographs with those infernal contraptions. The view from the castle terrace is quite fetching, though, even I, a hardened cynic, must admit. You can see the entire town laid out before you like a child’s toy, all miniature roofs and cobbled streets, basking in the (usually) benevolent German sunshine. Just try not to think too much about the climb up there – unless you fancy a good sweat and the distinct feeling of your lungs trying to escape your ribcage. And remember to bring sturdy shoes. One does not conquer Heidelberg in delicate slippers, any more than one conquers a lion with a feather duster.
