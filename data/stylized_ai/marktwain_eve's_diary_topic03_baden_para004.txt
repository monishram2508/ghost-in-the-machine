Baden-Baden, they call it. Baden repeated, mind you, as if the first Baden wasn't quite Baden enough. A redundancy that fairly screams, "We are important! Pay attention!" And pay attention one does, for it's difficult to ignore a place so determined to be noticed. It sits there, nestled in its Black Forest valley like a plump dowager in a velvet armchair, exhaling sulfurous vapours and an air of exquisite boredom. The waters, you see, are the draw. Waters that reek like rotten eggs and promise rejuvenation, a notion that strikes me as faintly preposterous. One dips oneself into these malodorous cauldrons and imagines, I suppose, one is shedding years like a molting canary. But truth be told, most of the shedding seems to be of one's dignity.

The Kurhaus, naturally, stands as a testament to this earnest, almost desperate, quest for youth and well-being. Gilded, ornamented, and teeming with folks who've likely seen more autumns than I've had hot dinners, it's a veritable mausoleum of hope. They parade, these bejeweled ancients, with their powdered faces and elaborate coiffures, each one a walking, talking exhibit of the relentless march of time. One can almost hear the ticking clock echoing off the frescoed ceilings, a gentle reminder that even the curative powers of stinky water can only postpone the inevitable. And the gambling! Goodness gracious, the gambling! They flock to the casino as moths to a flickering flame, wagering fortunes in the vain hope of outsmarting Lady Luck. I witnessed one poor fellow, his face the color of a freshly laundered sheet, lose enough to keep a small principality afloat for a year. He merely shrugged, patted his pockets, and muttered something about needing a stronger dose of the waters. Baden-Baden, you see, is not just a place; it's a philosophy. A philosophy of denial, extravagance, and the unshakable belief that somehow, somewhere, one can cheat the Reaper at his own game. A charming delusion, to be sure, even if it does leave one smelling faintly of boiled eggs and disappointment.
