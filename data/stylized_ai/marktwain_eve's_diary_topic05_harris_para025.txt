Harris, that man! A fellow so earnest in his endeavors to misunderstand a simple proposition, you’d think he practiced misinterpretation in the mirror every morning. I declare, watching him grapple with a basic instruction was akin to watching a cat attempting to solve differential calculus – a spectacle of flailing paws and bewildered yowls, utterly devoid of progress. He possessed a mind, you see, but it seemed to be perpetually locked in a state of polite bewilderment, like a Sunday school teacher lost in a saloon brawl. He’d nod with grave solemnity as you explained something, his brow furrowed in what I suspected was an attempt to look intelligent, all the while absorbing not a single blessed syllable. Then, he’d launch into an explanation of what he *thought* you meant, which would invariably be some fantastical notion that bore about as much resemblance to the truth as a catfish to a Stradivarius.

And the stories he told! Lord, they were of such magnificent, improbable proportions, you’d half expect to see unicorns prancing through his narrative landscape. A fishing trip, for instance, would evolve into a heroic battle against a kraken, the fish growing larger with each telling until they rivaled the size of a respectable steamboat. One dared not interrupt, for fear of disrupting the delicate web of fabrication he so diligently spun. He was, in essence, a walking, talking tall tale, a living embodiment of exaggeration elevated to an art form. You couldn’t entirely dislike him, mind you. He was, after all, a harmless sort, content to bumble through life leaving a trail of bewildered sighs and outrageous anecdotes in his wake. Though, truth be told, I wouldn't trust him to accurately report the color of the sky, lest he decide it was a charming shade of plaid, just for the sheer joy of it.
