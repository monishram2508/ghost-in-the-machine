Glaciers, those monumental rivers of ice, are powerful agents sculpting landscapes and acting as sensitive indicators of climate change. They form over extended periods, typically centuries, in regions where snowfall exceeds snowmelt, leading to the accumulation and compression of snow into dense glacial ice. This ice, under its own immense weight, begins to deform and flow downslope or outwards from a central accumulation zone. The movement, while often imperceptible to the naked eye, is a relentless force, carving deep valleys, smoothing bedrock, and transporting vast quantities of rock and sediment. Glacial erosion occurs through several processes. Plucking involves the freezing of meltwater within cracks in bedrock, which then expands and fractures the rock, allowing the glacier to rip it away. Abrasion, on the other hand, acts like sandpaper, with the glacier’s base laden with rock fragments grinding against the underlying surface, polishing it smooth and leaving behind characteristic striations. These erosional features provide valuable clues about the direction of past glacial flow.

Glaciers also play a crucial role in shaping depositional landscapes. As they melt and retreat, they leave behind a variety of landforms composed of sediment called till. Moraines, ridges of accumulated till, mark the former edges of a glacier, providing a tangible record of its past extent. Erratics, large boulders transported far from their original source, are also common glacial deposits, serving as stark reminders of the immense power of ice. Outwash plains, broad, flat areas composed of sorted sediment deposited by meltwater streams, extend outwards from the glacier's terminus. The cyclical advance and retreat of glaciers over millennia have dramatically altered landscapes worldwide, creating iconic features like the fjords of Norway, the Great Lakes of North America, and the alpine valleys of the Swiss Alps. Moreover, glaciers are significant freshwater reservoirs, storing a substantial portion of the world's fresh water. Their meltwater feeds rivers and sustains ecosystems, particularly in mountainous regions. However, with rising global temperatures, glaciers are rapidly shrinking, contributing to sea-level rise and impacting water resources downstream, underscoring the urgent need to understand and address climate change.
