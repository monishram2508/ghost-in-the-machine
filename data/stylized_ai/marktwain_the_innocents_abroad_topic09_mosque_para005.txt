Now, about this here mosque, you see. A feller could stumble upon one of these structures most anywhere in the Orient, and likely in places closer to home these days, too. Big ones, little ones, some practically shimmering with the glint of gold leaf and others plain as a barn, but each one claiming to be a doorway to the Almighty, or at least a reasonably comfortable waiting room. You'd think a God powerful enough to conjure up the stars wouldn't fret so much about the architecture, but people are people, and prone to decorating even the path to salvation with more baubles than a Christmas tree after a particularly profitable gold rush.

Inside, things are generally hushed. No pews to squawk under the weight of a restless sinner, just rugs spread across the floor like a Persian king had a yard sale. Menfolk are mostly segregated from the womenfolk, which, mind you, ain't always a bad thing, depending on the company. You’ll see them all bowing and scraping toward Mecca, a town that must be plumb worn out from all the attention. It’s a sight, I tell you, all those foreheads hitting the floor in unison, a veritable sea of devotion. Now, I’ve never been one for elaborate rituals, figuring the Good Lord appreciates a heartfelt thought just as much as a well-rehearsed knee bend, but I reckon if it keeps folks from pickpocketing each other and kicking up a ruckus in the saloon, then bowing and scraping is a small price to pay for peace and quiet. And then there's the fella who hollers from the tower five times a day, calling the faithful to prayer. A bit like a rooster with a megaphone, if you ask me, though I suppose it's less about waking up the neighborhood and more about reminding them that judgement day is coming. Makes a fella wonder if the Lord has a volume control, though. After all, a gentle reminder is often more effective than a blasted horn, especially when a man's trying to enjoy his afternoon nap.
