The Bedouin, bless their sun-baked hides, are a peculiar lot, ain't they? Imagine, if you will, a man whose home is wherever he pitches his tent – a rather flimsy affair, I might add, hardly the Ritz – and whose riches are counted not in gold, but in camels. Camels! Now, I've seen mules that possess more charm and a keener sense of direction, but the Bedouin, he fawns over these beasts like a debutante with a poodle. He'll name 'em, compose poetry about 'em, and likely consider one a suitable companion for an evening's conversation around the flickering fire. And what conversation it is! Tales of raids past, yarns stretched thinner than a desert mirage, and pronouncements on the lineage of their esteemed steeds that would make a Kentucky horse breeder blush.

They wander about the desert like tumbleweeds with a purpose, these Bedouins, guided by an instinct sharper than a Damascus blade. They can read the sand like a scholar reads scripture, locating water where a city-slicker like myself would only see endless, unforgiving waste. And generous? Why, a Bedouin will share his last date with a stranger, even if that stranger is a nosy journalist with an insatiable curiosity and a penchant for mildly offensive comparisons. Of course, he might also try to sell you a rusty dagger as a genuine relic of Saladin, but one learns to forgive such minor transgressions when faced with such genuine hospitality. They're a hardy bunch, that's certain. Lived in the desert for centuries, proving that if you're stubborn enough and possess an unshakeable faith in the utility of a camel, you can thrive anywhere, even in a place where the temperature rivals the hinges of hell and the only shade is cast by a particularly grumpy-looking vulture. A curious lot, indeed, and one cannot help but admire them, even if one suspects they're quietly chuckling at the gullibility of the well-meaning Westerner.
