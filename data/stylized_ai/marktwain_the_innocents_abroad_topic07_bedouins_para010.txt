Now, the Bedouin Arab, bless his wandering soul, is a fellow one meets out in the blasted, sun-baked wilderness, where even the vultures carry parasols. He’s a bit like a tumbleweed, if tumbleweeds had a taste for strong coffee and a keener eye for a camel than a pawnbroker has for a shiny gold watch. You’ll find him draped in more cloth than a theatrical company uses for a tragedy, all billowing and shifting in the breeze, which is, I suspect, mostly sand. He regards the horizon with a squint that suggests he's either seen the end of the world or just misplaced his spectacles, it’s hard to rightly tell.

His dwelling, the celebrated tent, is a grand affair of goat hair, guaranteed, so they say, to keep out the sun, the rain, and any lingering sense of civilization. In practice, it keeps out the sun… mostly. As for the rain, well, let’s just say I’ve seen sieves with fewer holes. But no matter, for inside you'll find carpets that would make a sultan green with envy, enough cushions to sink a small boat, and the ever-present coffee pot, bubbling with a brew so potent it could wake the dead and send them galloping across the desert in search of more. The Bedouin himself is a study in contradictions. He offers you hospitality that would shame a king, then haggles over the price of a camel with the tenacity of a terrier after a rat. He'll swear eternal friendship while simultaneously eyeing your possessions with a calculating gleam. But you can't hold it against him, you see, for out there in that desolate expanse, a fellow’s gotta look after himself, and perhaps after a spare camel or two. He is, in short, a survivor, a charming rogue, and a walking, talking paradox, and I would venture to say, even with all his quirks, the desert wouldn’t be quite the same without him and his ever-present pot of coffee.
