Now, this Coliseum, mind you, is a spectacle fit to make a seasoned gravedigger whistle. A vast, crumbling monstrosity of stone, it is, looking for all the world like a petrified beehive that’s been kicked about by the gods themselves for a century or two. They say it held fifty thousand souls, packed in like sardines in a tin, all hooting and hollering for blood. Fifty thousand, can you imagine? More than attend a temperance lecture in its entirety, I wager. And for what? To watch some poor devil, armed with naught but a net and a prayer, face off against a lion with claws sharper than a politician's wit and an appetite fiercer than a preacher's for a free meal. 

Of course, the Romans, bless their barbaric hearts, thought it was a grand entertainment. "Panem et circenses," they called it – bread and circuses. A clever scheme, I must admit. Keep the plebs fed and entertained, and they'll be too busy cheering for the gladiators to notice you're picking their pockets clean. It's the same principle politicians use today, only they've swapped out the lions for campaign promises and the gladiators for talking heads on the telly. Same difference, really. 

And the Colosseum stands there still, a silent, dusty witness to it all. You can almost hear the roar of the crowd, the clash of steel, the pitiful cries of the vanquished, all echoing through the ages. And if you listen close enough, I wouldn't be surprised if you heard the clinking of coins as some enterprising Roman senator, no doubt, counted his spoils, earned from the blood and sweat of those below. A grim reminder, it is, that even in the grandest of spectacles, there's always someone getting rich off the suffering of others. Makes a fellow wonder, don't it, if we've really come that far since the days of Nero fiddling while Rome burned. I suspect not, but that's a tale for another day, and likely requires a stronger drink than I currently possess.
