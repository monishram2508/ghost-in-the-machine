Now, concerning this edifice called a mosque, it strikes a fellow as a right curious sort of place, though not quite as peculiar as some would have you believe. I reckon you've heard tell of them – the minarets stabbing skyward like the fingers of some pious giant, the domes swelling like proud melons left too long in the sun. Inside, it ain't much for the glitter and gaudiness that seems to plague so many other houses of worship. No gilded angels blowing trumpets, nor saints frozen in perpetually pained expressions. No, sir, a mosque generally keeps things simple, bordering on austere. You'll find carpets aplenty, soft as a summer cloud if you're lucky, and geometric patterns that could make a mathematician weep with joy or confusion, depending on his disposition.

They do say these Muslims gather there to pray, facing towards some city far off to the east, which they call Mecca. A rather specific request, that, to be always looking that way. Imagine trying to have a decent conversation with a feller whose neck is permanently craned in the direction of Arabia! And the praying itself? Why, it's a regular ballet of bowing and prostrating, enough to give a fella back trouble just watching. They mutter and murmur, these Muslims, reciting things in a tongue I confess I haven't the faintest understanding of – probably prayers, though for all I know, they could be haggling over the price of dates. But, and here's the rub, they seem earnest enough, these Muslims. They ain't harming nobody, far as I can tell, with all their bowing and scraping. Seems to me, a body could do worse than spend an hour now and then contemplating the vastness of the universe, whether he does it standing up, kneeling down, or flat on his face. And if a man needs a grand building and a fancy carpet to get him in the mood for pondering such things, well, who am I to begrudge him? Besides, a bit of quiet contemplation is exactly what some folk need to avoid doing something truly outlandish, such as voting for the wrong sort of politician.
