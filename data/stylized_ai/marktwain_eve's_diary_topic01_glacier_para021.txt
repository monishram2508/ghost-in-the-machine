Well, I swan, if there ain't a glacier for you! It's a right peculiar thing, like a river decided to take a nap in the mountains and just never bothered to wake up. Imagine, if you will, a creek frozen solid, but 'stead of bein' a mere trickle, it's a whole blamed Mississippi of ice, inching its way down the valley slower than molasses in January. And talk about clutter! It's dragging along every rock, pebble, and unfortunate pine tree it can get its icy clutches on. Looks like a giant child’s sandbox after a tantrum, only colder and infinitely more persistent.

They call it 'erosion', this here glacier does. Sounds powerful and important, like some newfangled invention. But truth be told, it just means grinding mountains into gravel with a slow, agonizing patience that would make a snail look like a racehorse. It's a right bully, that glacier, flattening forests and carving out valleys like it's got all the time in the world, which, confound it, it probably does! And the color! Now, that’s a sight. You'd think ice would be all frosty white, but no sir, this ice is bluer than a robin's egg, especially deep down where the sun can't reach. Makes you wonder if maybe all that cold squeezes the very color outta the sky and traps it there. 

And bless my soul, the sound of it! A constant groan, a low rumble that vibrates right down to your boots. It’s like the mountain itself is complaining about a toothache, only the toothache is a continent-sized ice cube. And every now and then, you hear a crack, a sharp report like a rifle shot, when a chunk of the glacier decides it’s had enough and breaks off into a crevasse deep enough to swallow a barn. It's a fearsome beauty, that glacier, but I reckon I'd rather admire it from a good, safe distance, with a cup of coffee in hand. Wouldn’t want to get caught in its slow, icy grip, not even for all the tea in China.
