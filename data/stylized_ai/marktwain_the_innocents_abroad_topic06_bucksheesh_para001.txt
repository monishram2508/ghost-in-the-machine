Now, concerning this matter of bucksheesh, which is a word that rolls off the tongue like a loose cobblestone, and tastes of dust and sun-baked earth, it is a custom most peculiar, and one that sits betwixt outright bribery and simple, good-natured charity, much like a tipsy camel trying to straddle two sand dunes. You see it practiced most diligently in those corners of the world where the sun beats down with a vengeance and the bureaucrats languish with a languid air, as though time itself were molasses dripping from a spoon. Why, I once observed a fella trying to get his donkey cart across a bridge guarded by a fellow in a fez so large it threatened to topple him into the river. He pleaded and he argued, he gesticulated like a windmill in a hurricane, but to no avail. That fez-wearing guardian remained unmoved, a monument to indifference. Then, with a sigh that could have emptied a cistern, the carter produced a small, crumpled bill – a bucksheesh, mind you – and suddenly, the bridge was cleared, the donkey ambled across with the grace of a seasoned diplomat, and the guardian’s face blossomed into a smile wider than the Euphrates. It ain't precisely right, this bucksheesh business, mind you, not by the strictest moral compass. It’s a greasing of the wheels, a gentle persuasion, a little nudge to the gears of progress when they threaten to grind to a halt. But then, what in this world *is* precisely right, eh? One could argue that a generous heart, even when dipped in a little self-interest, is better than a heart as dry and barren as the Sahara. So, let us just say that bucksheesh is a peculiar flower that blooms in certain climes, and whether it is a rose or a weed depends, I reckon, on the gardener’s point of view, and how thirsty he is for a drop of water.
