Well, I declare, a glacier is just about the grandest, slowest, and most contrary critter you’ll ever clap eyes on. Picture, if you will, a river, only instead of being all bubbly and keen on getting somewhere, it's a solid river of ice, thicker than a preacher’s Sunday sermon and about as quick to change its mind. It oozes down mountainsides like a runaway wedding cake made of frozen tears, only instead of being sweet, it's cold enough to give the Devil himself a case of the shivers. And don't you dare think it's just a big, pretty chunk of scenery, no sir. This frozen behemoth is a mighty sculptor, carving valleys and mountains with the nonchalance of a bored farmer whittling a stick. It picks up rocks and boulders the size of houses, drags them along for a century or two, and then drops them with a careless shrug like a child discarding toys they've grown tired of.

Now, folks will tell you it's a natural wonder, a testament to the ages, and all that highfalutin stuff. And I suppose there's some truth in it. But between you and me, I think it’s mostly just showing off. Here it is, just lumbering about, grinding everything in its path, and leaving behind a trail of destruction disguised as geological formations. And the meltwater! Bless my soul, the meltwater. Enough water to make Noah think he was back in business. It spills and trickles and gushes, making a right watery nuisance of itself, all the while carrying more mud and silt than a Mississippi steamboat. Honestly, you'd think after all this time, the old glacier would’ve learned some manners. But there it goes, still doing its glacier thing, oblivious to the chaos and mess it's making, just like a cat with a ball of yarn, only considerably colder and less furry. It's a marvel, sure, but a mighty inconsiderate one, if you ask me.
