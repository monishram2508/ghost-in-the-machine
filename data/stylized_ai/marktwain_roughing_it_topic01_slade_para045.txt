Slade, that alkali-soaked sinkhole on the Overland Stage route, was a sight to cure even the most ardent westbound traveler of his romantic notions about conquering the wilderness. Why, I reckon a tumbleweed wouldn’t even pause for breath before skedaddling across that desolate patch of dirt, for fear of being mistaken for something of value. Now, they called it a town, mind you, and by the grace of God and the unwavering stubbornness of a few hardy souls, it boasted a saloon, a livery stable that smelled perpetually of misfortune, and a general store where the shelves were mostly decorated with dust and the occasional tin of something unidentifiable. I suspect the proprietor, a grizzled old coot named Jebediah, kept the expiration dates purely as decoration, claiming they added a certain “rustic charm” to the place. He also served as the town’s unofficial historian, spreading tales of the gold that wasn’t, the fortunes that evaporated, and the characters who’d been swallowed whole by the landscape. 

The inhabitants, well, they were a peculiar breed. A touch of desperation clung to them like the dust devils that swirled through the streets. Prospectors with more optimism than sense, gamblers with a penchant for losing (and a disturbing lack of teeth), and ladies of the night who looked like they’d seen better decades – all vying for survival in a place that seemed actively trying to reject them. They were a study in perseverance, I’ll grant you that, though I suspect a cockroach could have taught them a thing or two about sheer survival. And the stories, oh, the stories! Each one a tall tale embellished by whiskey fumes and the unwavering belief that someday, Slade would strike it rich. Me, I preferred to strike out of Slade, and did so with all due haste, leaving behind the dreams and the dust, and the distinct impression that I'd witnessed a slow-motion train wreck disguised as a town. If ever I find myself craving the stark beauty of the Nevada desert, I'll be sure to admire it from a good, safe distance, preferably while seated comfortably in a saloon far removed from Slade.
