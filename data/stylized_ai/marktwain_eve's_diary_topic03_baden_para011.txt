Baden-Baden, they call it. A name so good, they had to say it twice, likely to reassure the poor souls who find themselves dragged there that, yes, they are actually in a place. A place dripping with more dukes and dowagers than a butcher shop has chops. One can hardly swing a cat – though why anyone *would* swing a cat in Baden-Baden is beyond my poor comprehension – without knocking the wig off some aged aristocrat, who will, of course, glare daggers at you with eyes that have witnessed more scandalous liaisons than honest prayers. The waters, they say, are curative. Curative of what, pray tell? Certainly not boredom, for the hours stretch on longer than a parson's sermon on a Sunday. Perhaps they cure the excess wealth that seems to plague these high-born sufferers. I saw one gentleman, his face as pinched as a miser's purse, sipping the alleged miracle water with an expression that suggested he'd rather be swallowing quinine. And the architecture! Heavens to Betsy, it's enough to give one a crick in the neck just trying to take it all in. Palaces that would make Caesar weep with envy, and gardens so meticulously manicured, I swear I saw a gnome adjusting the rose bushes with a tiny plumb bob. The air itself is thick with perfume and pretensions, a veritable miasma of monied misery. Even the birds seem to sing with a refined, operatic quality, as if ashamed to chirp a common tune. And the gambling hall! Ah, there's where the true drama unfolds. Faces flushed, fortunes lost and won, and enough desperation to curdle milk. I wouldn't be surprised if the Devil himself took up residence there, just to observe the sheer ingenuity of man in finding new and exciting ways to lose his shirt. Yes, Baden-Baden, a place where one can bathe in luxury and boredom in equal measure, a town so steeped in tradition, it's practically fossilized. One visits it, I suspect, less for the healing waters, and more to confirm that, yes, some people truly *do* live in a world entirely divorced from reality. And that, my friends, is a cure in itself, of sorts.
