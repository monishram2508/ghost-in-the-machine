Brigham, now there was a fellow for you, a regular Moses in homespun, leading his flock across the desert that was just itching to swallow ‘em whole. Salt Lake City, that’s his handiwork, sprung from the dust like a jackrabbit from a magician's hat. You wouldn't credit it, seeing the parched land, but Brigham, he had a vision, see? A vision and a water ditch. He figured, and rightly so, that water and elbow grease could tame anything short of a Missouri mule. They say he stood there, pointing with that prophet-ish arm of his, and declared, “This is the place!” I reckon half the folks were too tired to argue, the other half figuring a man who could convince 'em to traipse that far must know something they didn't.

He was a practical sort, Brigham, not like those fellas back East preaching pie-in-the-sky after you're dead. He was all about pie now, pie you could sink your teeth into, made with peaches you grew yourself, watered with that selfsame ditch. Folks grumbled, naturally, about the work, the heat, the lack of whiskey (a grievous oversight, if you ask me), but Brigham, he just kept building. Built temples, built homes, built… well, built families, a whole heap of 'em. Some folks clucked about the polygamy business, called it scandalous. I ain't one to judge; never found myself with enough willing women to make it an issue, but I'll say this: Brigham had a system. Kept things orderly, or as orderly as you can keep anything when you're trying to feed that many mouths and dodge the United States Army at the same time. He was a dictator, some claimed, a tyrant! Maybe so. But he was a dictator who built a city, a tyrant who kept folks alive. And in the West, where the only law is survival, that counts for something, don’t you think? Course, you couldn't trust him five feet if he was holding a shovel and promising gold, but give the man his due, he made something out of nothing, which is more than you can say for most politicians, then or now.
