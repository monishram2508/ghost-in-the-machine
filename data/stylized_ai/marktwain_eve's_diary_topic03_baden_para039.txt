Baden, they call it, Baden-Baden to be precise, which struck me as a redundancy not unlike calling a cat, Cat-Cat, or a bore, Bore-Bore. Though, I must admit, the place does have a certain… varnish. A gilded veneer, if you will, plastered over a landscape that, absent the elaborate fripperies, might actually be quite charming. The air is thick with the perfume of money and medicated waters, each vying for supremacy in the nostrils of the passing tourist. I found myself nearly gagging on the combination, a sensation akin to eating a gilded prune while listening to a tiresome lecture on the proper use of a bidet.

One goes to Baden, of course, for the waters. They bubble up from the earth with a sulfurous enthusiasm, promising to cure everything from a stubborn melancholy to a misplaced spleen. I saw ladies of considerable girth, bedecked in diamonds that could bankrupt a small principality, partaking of the curative liquid with an air of pious determination, as if forcing down a dose of eternal youth with each grimace. It reminded me of that time I tried to swallow a spoonful of varnish, believing it would make me shinier. Lesson learned, I assure you. 

And then there are the casinos. Ah, the casinos! Palaces of chance where fortunes are won and lost with a recklessness that borders on the sublime. I watched a mustachioed gentleman, his face the color of week-old cheese, bet his entire inheritance on the turn of a card, only to witness it vanish with a gasp that rattled the chandeliers. One minute, he was a man of means; the next, he was contemplating the architectural intricacies of the cobblestones outside. A sobering sight, though not so sobering as the bill I ran up sampling the local wines. They say Baden is a place to find healing and renewal. I suspect it’s far more efficient at extracting gold from the gullible, leaving them to heal and renew their bank accounts elsewhere. Still, one must concede, it's a rather diverting spectacle, even if it does leave one feeling slightly… sulfurous.
