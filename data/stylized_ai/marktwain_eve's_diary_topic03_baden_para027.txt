Baden-Baden, they call it, a city so steeped in the waters of relaxation and so encrusted with the gilded baubles of aristocracy that one half expects to find Father Adam himself, lounging in a marble tub, recounting tales of fig leaves and fallen angels. It’s a place where the air hangs thick with the scent of perfumed pomades and the rustle of silks, a veritable peacock’s promenade of the wealthy and the bored. You stroll along the Lichtentaler Allee, that leafy artery of Baden, and you’re assaulted by a parade of poodle-doggies, each coiffed to a degree that would make even a French courtesan jealous, and their mistresses, sporting hats the size of dinner plates and jewels that could blind a man at fifty paces. One feels like a humble mouse at a banquet, surrounded by so much opulent cheese.

The conversations overheard are enough to curdle milk. The merits of this horse versus that, the superiority of a particular vintage of wine (vintage, mind you, not the taste!), and the excruciating boredom of having to decide which diamond tiara to wear to the opera. One poor lady, her face pulled tauter than a drumhead, actually lamented the fact that her husband had bought her *only* a ten-carat emerald necklace for her birthday. The audacity! One nearly felt compelled to offer her a handful of shiny pebbles just to watch the sheer horror blossom across her countenance.

And then there are the waters, those supposed elixirs of youth and rejuvenation. They smell suspiciously like boiled eggs and are apparently teeming with minerals that can cure everything from gout to a slight disinclination to part with one’s money. I, for one, remained blissfully uncured, finding more amusement in watching the various individuals attempt to look dignified while sipping the aforementioned egg-water from delicate porcelain cups. It's a curious business, this Baden-Baden. One goes to find health, and ends up finding, instead, a quite remarkable collection of eccentricities, all wrapped up in the gaudy packaging of high society.
