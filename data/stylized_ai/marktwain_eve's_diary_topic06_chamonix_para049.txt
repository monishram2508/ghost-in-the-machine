Chamonix, bless its little Alpine heart. It sits there, all nestled like a forgetful squirrel amidst the most preposterous mountain scenery imaginable. Mountains so high they seem to poke the very eye of heaven, and so craggy and sharp, they look like God Almighty misplaced his bread knife and left it sticking straight up. The tourists flock, of course, drawn by the Mont Blanc, which, I confess, is a sight that would make even the most hardened cynic reconsider their prejudices concerning nature and beauty, though perhaps only for a fleeting moment. They come, these tourists, in all shapes and sizes, from the stout German fellow in lederhosen, who looks perpetually as though he’s just swallowed a particularly sour pickle, to the slender Parisian beauties whose heels, one imagines, are quite unsuitable for cobblestones, let alone a glacier. And each and every one of them, they come to *conquer* the mountain, or at least, to be photographed looking as though they did. 

The town itself, Chamonix, is a comical mix of the charming and the blatantly commercial. One can, in the space of five minutes, purchase an authentic Savoyard cheese, then be accosted by a gentleman selling miniature Swiss Army knives (Swiss! In France! The audacity!). The air is thick with the aroma of melted cheese and overpriced perfume, a combination that would make even Cleopatra herself wrinkle her nose. And the guides, oh, the guides! They stride about with the air of demigods, sporting ropes and ice axes and a knowing smile that suggests they've seen everything, done everything, and probably once rescued a damsel from a snowdrift while simultaneously juggling three flaming torches. One cannot help but admire their swagger, though I suspect a good many of them spend more time in the local café than on the perilous heights they so readily describe. Yet, one can't begrudge them their livelihood, for without them, the tourists would surely wander off and get lost, swallowed whole by the majestic, and frankly, rather indifferent, mountains. It’s all quite a show, Chamonix, a delicious blend of the sublime and the ridiculous, a spectacle that even a weary traveler such as myself can find amusing, at least until the bill arrives.
