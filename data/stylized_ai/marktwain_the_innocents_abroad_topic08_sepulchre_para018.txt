Now, a sepulchre, mind you, is a grand sort of box for the dead, fancier than your average pine affair they shove poor souls into nowadays. It's got pretensions, a sepulchre does, thinking itself above the common graveyard dust. I reckon a fellow with a sepulchre is either almighty proud or almighty scared of being forgot, and probably a bit of both, if we're being honest. I saw one once, in Italy somewhere, a colossal marble thing with angels weeping all over it. Angels! As if a stone cherub could shed a tear any more genuine than a politician's promise. You'd think a man important enough for such a mausoleum would be busy hobnobbing with the celestial choir, not stuck listening to silent marble sniffles for eternity.

The inscription, oh, that was a sight to behold. Lines upon lines of accomplishments, virtues practically bursting off the stone. More than likely, half of them were stretched further than a politician's alibi. It spoke of wisdom, courage, charity – the whole blessed kit and caboodle. But I couldn't help but wonder what the fellow was really like, under all that carved-in flattery. Did he kick the cat? Cheat at cards? Probably, if he was human, and rich enough to buy himself a mountain of marble and a flattering eulogy. It just goes to show, doesn't it? Death might be the great leveler, but even in the face of it, some folks will find a way to stand a little taller, at least in stone, even if their souls are six feet under with the rest of us. And as for those sepulchres, I tell you, they are nothing more than fancy houses in the city of the dead.
