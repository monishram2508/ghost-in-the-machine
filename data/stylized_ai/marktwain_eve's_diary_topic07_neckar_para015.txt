That Neckar, now there's a river with a peculiar temperament, a fluvial spinster, if you will, that seems to change her mind more often than a society dame choosing a hat. One day she's all placid serenity, reflecting the gingerbread hues of Heidelberg like a looking glass polished by cherubs, and the next – bless my soul! – she’s frothing and fussing, churning like a milkmaid after a particularly bothersome cow, threatening to swallow the student rowing boats whole. I've seen her, I have, behaving with such unexpected vigor that one might imagine she’s harboring a secret longing for the wilder ways of the Rhine, but alas, she's forever shackled to her tidy, vine-clad banks. She flows through lands so ridiculously picturesque, so saturated with castles and half-timbered houses, that a fellow begins to suspect the entire scene was staged for the benefit of particularly gullible tourists. And the locks! Good heavens, the locks. They rise and fall with such methodical precision, so utterly devoid of spontaneity, that one half expects them to sprout little bowler hats and start reciting German proverbs. One cannot help but ponder, however, if these locks are truly for the convenience of barge traffic or merely a particularly elaborate scheme devised by the local burghers to provide a bit of entertainment for the tourists (and, let's be honest, themselves). The barge captains, bless their weary souls, navigate her with a knowing air, as if they’ve long ago deciphered the Neckar's capricious moods and possess a secret charm to soothe her anxieties. And the swans, ah, the swans. They glide about with a haughty grace, convinced, no doubt, that the entire river exists solely for their benefit, a floating banquet table laden with delectable scraps of tourist-discarded bread crusts. One half expects to see them issue decrees from their feathery thrones, demanding better bread or perhaps a more fashionable shade of blue for the river's water. Yes, the Neckar is a curious creature, a river of contradictions and quiet humors, a steady hand and a fluttery heart, all in one meandering flow.
