Now, pard, about this pard business. You stroll into Nevada Territory thinkin’ you can just slap a “pard” on a fella like a brandin’ iron on a stray calf. Well, let me tell you, “pard” ain’t just a word you toss around like a busted whiskey bottle after a Saturday night brawl. It’s supposed to signify somethin’, somethin’ akin to sharin’ a tin cup of muddy water in the scorching desert sun, or backin’ each other up against a gaggle of claim jumpers armed with more greed than sense. You can’t just call the fella who happens to be standin’ next to you at the bar “pard,” especially if you’re buyin’ him drinks with money you just swindled outta a greenhorn fresh off the stagecoach. That there’s just opportunistic politeness, and smells worse than a skunk in a bathhouse.

I’ve seen fellas callin’ each other “pard” one minute, then pullin’ a knife on each other the next over a measly poker hand. It's a sorry sight, worse than watchin’ a jackrabbit try to outrun a steam locomotive. No, a real pard is someone you can trust your life with, someone who’d share his last piece of jerky, even if it tastes like saddle leather that’s been chew on for a week. A pard’s someone who wouldn’t snicker when you fall face-first into a pile of cow dung, but would instead help you up, offer a hand to scrape it off, and maybe even crack a joke about your resemblance to a fertilizer salesman. See, it's got to be earned, this pardness. It's like a stubborn mule, you gotta coax it, not beat it. So, before you go callin’ every Tom, Dick, and Harry “pard,” you might wanna consider whether you’d trust him to hold your gold while you wrestle a bear, or at least share his blanket on a cold desert night. Otherwise, just stick to "mister," it's honest, if not exactly heartwarming.
