The Neckar, bless its meandering heart, isn't quite the Mississippi, I'll grant you that. It hasn’t got the same… theatrical flair, the way it can swallow a steamboat whole and barely hiccup. But what it lacks in sheer boisterousness, it makes up for in a sort of polite, almost apologetic charm. It snakes through these Rhineland-Palatinate parts like a shy maiden trailing a silken ribbon, never quite making a grand entrance but always leaving a pleasing impression nonetheless. You see, it’s not given to fits of temper like some rivers I’ve known, flooding over its banks and causing no end of trouble for decent folk. No sir, the Neckar is a well-behaved river, content to trickle past castles that have seen better days and vineyards that are just about to.

One might argue it's a bit…domesticated. Like a wildcat that's been given a saucer of cream and now purrs on your lap, occasionally batting at a dangling string. The Germans, bless their organized souls, have tamed it rather effectively, you see. Barges chug along with clockwork regularity, carrying coal and grain, and probably the occasional bewildered tourist convinced they’re on a Rhine cruise by mistake. You can stroll along its banks on paths so manicured they practically require a top hat and tails. I reckon even the fish in this river are orderly, swimming in neat little schools and queuing up for bread crumbs tossed by rosy-cheeked children.

It's picturesque, no doubt about it, but picturesque in the way a porcelain doll is picturesque. It’s got all the right elements, carefully arranged, with not a single hair (or ripple, rather) out of place. You won’t find Huck Finn drifting down this waterway on a raft made of scavenged planks. It’s more likely to be a group of well-dressed students rowing in unison, singing a German folk song about lost love and the importance of punctuality. All in all, the Neckar's a fine river, a respectable river, a river that would never dream of spitting tobacco juice or telling a tall tale. Just don't expect any miracles.
