Winter in Nevada, bless its frozen little heart, is a spectacle. Not a pretty one, mind you, unless you fancy a landscape the color of a bleached skull adorned with the occasional stunted sagebrush. Now, some folks will tell you tales of sparkling snow and invigorating air, making it sound like a darned Christmas card. Don't you believe a word of it! That’s Eastern nonsense, probably peddled by some tenderfoot who’s never spent a week fighting a frozen well pump with a rusty crowbar in January. The snow, when it does bother to show its face, isn't the fluffy, gentle kind. No, sir, this is the snow that arrives with a vengeance, driven by winds that could peel the paint off a locomotive. It turns to ice before you can say "Jack Frost," and then you're left with a choice: stay inside and stare at the peeling wallpaper, or venture out and risk turning into a human icicle.

And the cold? Good heavens, the cold! It's a bone-deep, soul-chilling kind of cold that seems to penetrate every stitch of clothing and set up camp in your very marrow. It makes a man think longingly of those summer days sweltering in the sun, chasing fool’s gold and swatting flies. Yes, even the flies seem preferable to this frozen torment. You learn to appreciate the little things, like a lukewarm cup of coffee that tastes like heaven and a fireplace that spits more smoke than heat. And the sunsets! Well, those can be downright stunning, painting the frozen wasteland in hues of fiery orange and mournful purple. But they only last for a fleeting moment, a cruel reminder that beauty is fleeting and the long, dark night is just around the corner, bringing with it another round of teeth-chattering, blanket-piling, soul-searching cold. Truth be told, a Nevada winter builds character. Or at least, it forces you to consider relocating somewhere considerably closer to the equator.
