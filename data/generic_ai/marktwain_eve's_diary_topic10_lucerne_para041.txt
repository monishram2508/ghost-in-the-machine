Lucerne, also widely known as alfalfa, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. Its importance in agriculture stems from its exceptional nutritional value as forage and its ability to improve soil health. This plant, originating from the Middle East, has spread globally and is cultivated in a wide range of climates, thanks to its deep root system that allows it to access water and nutrients unavailable to many other crops. Lucerne's leaves are trifoliate, resembling clover, and the flowers are typically purple or blue, although variations in yellow and white can also occur. It is primarily grown as livestock feed, serving as a high-protein source for cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Farmers often harvest lucerne multiple times throughout the growing season, as it regrows quickly after cutting, providing a reliable and consistent feed supply. The forage can be utilized in various forms, including hay, silage, and pasture, offering flexibility in livestock feeding strategies.

Beyond its nutritional value, lucerne plays a vital role in soil improvement. As a legume, it possesses a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil. These bacteria, residing in root nodules, convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use, enriching the soil and reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. This natural nitrogen fixation not only benefits the lucerne crop itself but also improves the soil fertility for subsequent crops planted in rotation. Furthermore, lucerne's extensive root system helps to improve soil structure by breaking up compacted soil, enhancing water infiltration, and reducing soil erosion. Its deep roots can also draw up minerals from lower soil layers, making them available to other plants. Lucerne is thus often used in crop rotation systems to improve soil health, reduce fertilizer input, and enhance overall agricultural sustainability. In addition to its benefits in animal feed and soil health, lucerne is increasingly being investigated for its potential in human nutrition. It is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and is sometimes consumed as sprouts or added to salads and other dishes, highlighting its versatility and potential beyond traditional agricultural applications.
