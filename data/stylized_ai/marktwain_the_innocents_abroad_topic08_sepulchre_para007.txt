Now, sepulchres, these repositories of the departed, are curious contraptions, are they not? Man builds them with such enduring ambition, as if to defy the very thing the occupant succumbed to. You’ll find them perched on hillsides, nestled in valleys, or crammed betwixt the living in cities, each a stone-cold assertion of permanence in the face of the utterly temporary. The Egyptians, bless their papyrus-swathed souls, went so far as to furnish the place like a regular home, stocked with jars of pickles and what-not, assuming, I reckon, that the departed pharaoh would get a hankering for a midnight snack in the afterlife. Sensible chaps, in a way, though I wager the grave robbers appreciated the foresight more than the pharaoh did.

Then you've got your more modest affairs, the simple plots marked by weather-beaten stones. I remember visiting one such graveyard in Hannibal, Missouri, where the inscriptions were so faded, you couldn't tell if the fellow resting beneath was a hero of the War of 1812 or a baker who made a particularly awful loaf of bread. Likely the latter, if I'm being honest. Folks tend to remember the bad bread longer than the heroic deeds. But regardless of size or fanciness, these sepulchres all share the same essential purpose: to remind the living that they, too, will one day be tenants in a similar, albeit slightly less comfortable, establishment. It’s a rather morbid thought, of course, but a necessary one, I suspect. Keeps a man from getting too high and mighty, knowing that eventually he'll be feeding the daisies just like everyone else. And who knows, maybe, just maybe, there's a jar of pickles waiting for him on the other side, though I wouldn't count on it. The Lord works in mysterious ways, but I doubt he concerns himself with posthumous snacking arrangements.
