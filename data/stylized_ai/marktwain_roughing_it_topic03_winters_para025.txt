Winter in Nevada, ah, that's a season designed to separate the tenderfoots from the seasoned sourdoughs, the gents from the jays, if you catch my drift. It ain't no gentle nudge with frost on the pumpkin, no sirree. Winter here comes down like a drunken miner falling off a porch roof, sudden, noisy, and leaving a right mess. One day you're basking in a sun so bright it could melt a preacher’s resolve, and the next, you’re staring down the maw of a blizzard that'd make a polar bear homesick. Snow? Why, we get snow that’s drier than a Methodist sermon, and drifts that stack up higher than a stack of silver dollars after a lucky strike. You could lose a whole town in some of them drifts, I reckon, and nobody'd be the wiser, nor would they particularly care, seein' as how that town probably deserved it anyway.

Folks huddle up indoors, looking like bears in hibernation, only grumpier. Conversation dwindles down to the price of firewood and the latest tall tale of a lost mule train. The saloons, however, do a roaring trade. A man needs something to keep his blood thawed out when the mercury's playing hide-and-seek in the bottom of the thermometer. Whiskey does the trick nicely, though I wouldn't recommend testin' it with a match – might blow the whole place sky-high. The roads turn into treacherous paths of ice and frozen ruts, fit only for a jackrabbit with a death wish. Getting anywhere becomes an adventure, one where the ending is rarely happy and often involves a frozen backside and a string of colorful oaths that’d make a sailor blush. But you get used to it, you see. You learn to brace yourself, to curse politely, and to appreciate the occasional glimpse of sunshine that manages to sneak through the clouds. After all, even a Nevada winter has to end sometime. Though, if you ask me, it does take its own sweet time about it, just to make sure we've all learned our lesson about bragging on the weather in October.
