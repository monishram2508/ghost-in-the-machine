Zermatt, bless its cotton socks and improbable location, is a place where the mountains play a particularly high-stakes game of peek-a-boo. They are, in a word, colossal, those fellows. The Matterhorn, that theatrical old coot, looms like a stage backdrop painted by a drunken titan, perpetually shrouded in a wisp of cloud – probably smoking a cheroot and chuckling at the antics of the puny humans below. One gets the distinct impression that it wouldn’t hesitate to flick a casual avalanche down just to clear its throat. The air, I must say, is thinner than a debutante's wits after a bottle of champagne. One’s lungs puff and pant as if they've just sprinted a marathon, which, incidentally, is precisely what one feels like doing just to reach the bakery for a croissant.

And the transport! Good gracious. No combustion engines allowed, mark you. Oh no, one must rely on electric buggies that buzz about like overfed bees, threatening to run down any unfortunate pedestrian who dares to pause for breath, or contemplate the scandalous prices in the shop windows. The shops, you see, are chock-full of fripperies designed to separate tourists from their earnings. Cuckoo clocks that cuckoo with a distinctly avaricious tone, and trinkets crafted with such exquisite skill that they are practically begging to be lost at the earliest possible opportunity. The locals, bless their souls, are a hardy bunch, browned and weathered like old leather. They regard the tourists with a mixture of amusement and weary resignation, like zookeepers observing the antics of particularly boisterous monkeys. One suspects they secretly harbor a yearning for the quiet days before the invention of the camera and the endless parade of shutterbugs determined to capture the Matterhorn in all its glory, thus blocking the view for everyone else. But, despite all the absurdity, the striving, and the pocket-picking prices, Zermatt possesses a certain undeniable charm. A charm that clings to you like a persistent burr, even after you've descended from those lofty heights and returned to the comparatively level playing field of ordinary life. A charm, if I may be so bold, worth a glimpse or two, just mind your wallet and your ankles.
