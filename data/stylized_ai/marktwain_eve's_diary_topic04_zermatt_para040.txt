Zermatt, bless its picturesque heart, sits nestled at the foot of that grand old pyramid, the Matterhorn – a rock pile so imposing, one half expects Moses to come scrambling down with a fresh set of commandments etched in granite. I’ve seen mountains aplenty in my travels, mind you, but this one has a certain… audacity. It looms, it glowers, it makes you feel like a particularly insignificant ant contemplating the structural integrity of a very large sugar cube. The village itself is a delightful jumble of chalets and cobbled streets, looking for all the world like a gingerbread town escaped from a particularly ambitious baker’s oven. Of course, the air is perpetually clean, a fact that both invigorates the lungs and simultaneously reminds you of the smoky depths you usually inhabit. It’s the sort of cleanliness that makes one yearn for a good, honest whiff of coal dust, just to feel grounded in reality again.

And the tourists! Ah, the tourists. A veritable smorgasbord of nationalities, all clad in various shades of ski attire that seem determined to prove that fashion sense takes a holiday along with the wearer. There are the bronzed ski instructors, oozing an almost offensive amount of confidence, and the earnest beginners, resembling baby deer taking their first, wobbly steps on a freshly iced pond. Then you have the seasoned mountaineers, clad in ropes and ice axes, looking like they’re off to wrestle a glacier into submission. But the real spectacle, as always, is the parade of the well-heeled. They come adorned in furs that likely cost more than my entire wardrobe (including my lucky underpants, may they rest in peace), sipping champagne and discussing the merits of various caviar brands. One almost expects them to be carried around on gilded sedan chairs, though I suspect the local authorities might frown upon that. All in all, Zermatt is a delightful, if slightly absurd, theatre of the absurd, a place where nature’s grandeur meets human foibles in a truly entertaining collision. A body could do worse than sit back with a glass of something strong and watch the spectacle unfold.
