Lucerne, they call it, and a pretty enough name it is, I allow, for a place nestled right up against a lake so blue it makes you question if maybe the sky didn't accidentally spill some of itself down into Switzerland. You’d think, with all that water shimmerin' and reflectin' like a freshly polished mirror, that folks would be peaceful and contemplative. But no, sir. They’re busy clanging cowbells and tootin' on alphorns, a racket that’d wake the dead, all in the name of picturesque tradition. I tell you, picturesque traditions are the bane of the traveler’s existence. They're fine to look at in a picture book, but try sleeping through a yodelling contest at 3 in the mornin'. Gives a body pause, it does. The mountains that surround the place, though, those are somethin'. They stand there, rugged and indifferent to all the folderol below, like ancient judges frownin' down on a particularly spirited puppet show. Mount Pilatus, particularly, seems to have a permanent scowl etched upon its brow, as if somebody had dared to suggest it wasn't the most impressive pile of rock in the whole confounded country. And the Lion Monument! Carved right into a cliff face, a dyin' lion, mournful and majestic. Now, that's worth lookin' at. A lion carved in stone, feelin' sorry for itself in a foreign land. I can relate, I tell you. Except my sorrow comes from payin' ten francs for a cup of coffee that tastes like boiled dishwater. They say the Swiss are neutral, but when it comes to prices, they're definitely takin' sides. Still, Lucerne has a certain charm, like a fussy old aunt who insists on serving you fruitcake you don't want, but who also secretly slips you a twenty-franc note when nobody's lookin'. You might complain about the noise and the prices, but you'll remember the blue of the lake and the grim dignity of the mountains long after you've forgotten the taste of that infernal coffee. And that, I reckon, is worth somethin'.
