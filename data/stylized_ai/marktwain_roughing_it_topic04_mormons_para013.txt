Well, I reckon I’ve seen a fair piece of the elephant, and that elephant has often sported a curious saddle blanket stitched with beehives and angels. These here Mormons, they're a puzzle fit to challenge even the most seasoned prospector. Down there in Salt Lake, they've built themselves a city that shines brighter than a freshly minted twenty-dollar piece, right smack dab in the middle of a desert that could swallow a lesser community whole. And Brigham Young, bless his enterprising soul, he managed to marshal ‘em all, like a shepherd with a particularly large and rambunctious flock. They’re industrious, no doubt about it; they work harder than a flea on a hot griddle. I've seen ‘em irrigate land where even a cactus would throw up its spiny arms in despair, coaxing forth crops that’d make your eyes water with disbelief.

Now, about that peculiar institution of theirs – plural marriage. A fella could spend a lifetime tryin' to figure that one out, and still come up short. It’s whispered about in saloons and debated around campfires from here to kingdom come, and I ain’t sure anyone’s ever truly got to the bottom of it. Some say it's pure deviltry, a way to exert power over the fairer sex. Others claim it’s a practical solution for a community short on men and long on hard labor. Me? I reckon it's a bit of both, seasoned with a healthy dose of religious conviction. Their missionaries, they spread out further than a politician’s promises, converting folks from the far corners of the earth with the zeal of a hound dog chasin' a rabbit. They're a close-knit bunch, these Mormons, stickin' together tighter than ticks on a sheepdog. And whilst I might not cotton to all their ways, I got to admire their grit, their determination, and their ability to make the desert bloom like a rose, even if that rose happens to be growing next to a whole mess of thorny complications. They're an original, there's no denyin' that, and the west is a more curious and complicated place with them than without.
