Well, pard, let me tell you 'bout these here thunderstorms out West. They ain't like them lily-livered showers back East, no sir. Out here, when it rains, it’s like the heavens themselves are having a good, hard cry. You'll be sittin' pretty, mindin' your own beeswax, when suddenly the sky'll turn the color of a bruised plum, and then BAM! Lightning bolts thick as a man's thigh come slappin' down, splittin' trees cleaner than a butcher's cleaver. And the thunder? Why, it rolls 'round these mountains like a drunken prospector lookin' for his gold claim. You half expect to see it stumble out of the sky, brushin' off the dust and apologizin' for the ruckus.

One time, I was holed up in a deserted mine shaft, tryin' to avoid gettin' wetter than a drowned rat, when a bolt of lightning struck so close, the hair stood up on my head like I’d been courtin' a porcupine. Near scared the liver right out of me, I tell you. I looked out and saw this old cottonwood tree, a respectable citizen of the forest, mind you, get instantly turned into kindlin'. Blasted to smithereens! It was enough to make a saint swear.

And the rain! It comes down in sheets, not drops, pard. Sheets that could drown a cat, a dog, and maybe even a politician if you held him under long enough. Makes the rivers swell up like a boastful bully showing off his muscles, and washes away anything that ain't tied down. I saw a whole saloon floatin' down the Carson River one time. Bar, chairs, piano and all. Now, that's what I call a waterin' hole, alright, but I reckon the clientele were a bit damp for comfort. After a storm like that, the air smells clean as a preacher's conscience, and everything's washed and shiny, ready for another round of dust and debauchery. But Lord, it's a spectacle to behold, pard. A real rip-roarin', hell-raisin' display of nature's temper. Worth dodgin' the lightning just to see it.
