Higbie, now there was a specimen. Not built for speed, mind you, more like a sturdy ox cart than a thoroughbred. A feller so placid you could set off dynamite in his lap and he'd likely just scratch his beard and inquire if you had another stick. He ran a claim up near Carson, one of those "promising" affairs that promised only dust and disappointment, but Higbie, bless his simple soul, was convinced he was sitting on a mountain of silver. He'd spend his days pickin' at the rock with a determination that would shame a badger diggin' for grubs, all the while whistling a tune that sounded suspiciously like a rusty gate hinge complainin' to the wind.

He was a walking encyclopedia of misinformation, was Higbie. He knew more about the habits of the California jackalope than the value of a silver certificate, and he'd argue, with the straightest face imaginable, that the moon was made of green cheese, citing irrefutable "evidence" gleaned from a magazine he'd found under a sagebrush. He was also, and I say this with a certain fondness for the crackpot, generous as a harvest moon. Whatever little he had, he'd share. A spare biscuit, a cup of lukewarm coffee, even advice, no matter how hilariously wrong, were offered with a genuine warmth that could melt the Sierra snows.

One time, he convinced himself that the buzzing of a common housefly was actually the sound of subterranean water, and he spent a solid week digging a hole big enough to bury a stagecoach, all based on the pronouncements of that infernal insect. Found nothin' but more dirt and a considerable amount of sweat. You'd think he'd be discouraged, but not Higbie. He just shrugged, filled the hole back up, and declared that the fly had moved on to a better prospect. A man of unwavering faith in the absurd, that was Higbie. A fool, maybe, but a damn sight more entertaining than most of the smart ones I’ve come across.
