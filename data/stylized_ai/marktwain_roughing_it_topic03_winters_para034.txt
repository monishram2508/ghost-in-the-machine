Winter, bless its frosted heart, arrives in these parts like a bill collector with a perpetual sneer. One minute you're swatting flies the size of hummingbirds and the next, by thunder, the wind’s howling like a banshee with a toothache, and the ground's suddenly wearing a tablecloth of dirty white. Now, folks around here, they’ll try to romanticize it, tell you about the “crisp air” and the “sparkling snow.” Don’t you believe a word of it! The air's so crisp it’ll snap your nose right off if you ain’t careful, and that “sparkling snow” is mostly just mud turned to concrete that's guaranteed to send you sprawling on your dignity. Then, just when you've mastered walking like a penguin on a skating rink, the temperature decides to stage a jailbreak from the thermometer and you're wading through slush so thick it could choke a buffalo.

And the animals? Don’t even get me started. The bears, wise creatures they are, take one look at the impending gloom and decide to nap till springtime, snoring louder than a steamboat engine. The birds, sensible fellows, hightail it south where they can bask in the sunshine and chuckle at our misery. We, on the other hand, are stuck here, bundled up in so many layers of flannel and wool that we resemble overgrown potatoes, shuffling through the landscape like zombies in search of warmth. The days shrink to the size of dimes, the sun becomes a forgotten myth, and the only entertainment is watching icicles grow until they resemble the spears of a particularly grumpy army. But, Lord, there's a perverse charm to it all, like a bad joke that you can't help but chuckle at. It’s a test, I reckon, to see how much a man can endure before he cracks. And when spring finally arrives, smelling like wet earth and new beginnings, why, you appreciate it all the more because you've survived the winter. Or, at least, you think you have. Truth be told, a little piece of you probably froze solid somewhere along the way.
