Now, about this chamois, or "shammy" as some folks mistakenly call it, a creature I confess I'd never laid eyes on until Adam started yammering about the "high Alps" and needing something to polish his fig leaf armor. Seems a rather specific requirement, wouldn't you say? Anyway, this chamois, a sort of goat-antelope contraption, I’m told, is built for mischief, practically designed by the same fellow who conjured up mosquitoes. They frolic about on those impossibly steep inclines as if gravity itself were a suggestion rather than a law. Imagine the audacity! Here I am, struggling to navigate a slightly uneven patch of Eden’s turf, and these creatures are performing acrobatics worthy of a traveling circus troupe, all while nonchalantly nibbling on alpine wildflowers.

Adam, bless his simple heart, returned from his Alpine sojourn with a tale involving perilous cliffs, a near encounter with an avalanche (he demonstrated the tumbling with considerable enthusiasm, nearly dislodging the rhubarb patch), and, most importantly, a chamois skin. He assures me it's the finest cleaning implement one could ever acquire, although I confess, I find it hard to believe anything that spends its life scaling sheer rock faces can be considered "fine" in any civilized sense. He tried to explain the 'natural oils' and 'gentle fibers' and all that poppycock. To me, it just looks like something a mountain lion coughed up. Still, if it keeps him from scratching his fig leaves with a rough stone and then complaining about the chafing, I suppose I can tolerate its existence. Besides, maybe I'll use it to polish the serpent's scales. That creature could certainly use a good buffing; it's got the dullest gleam imaginable. Anything that improves his appearance can only be a positive thing, given the effect he had on me previously.
