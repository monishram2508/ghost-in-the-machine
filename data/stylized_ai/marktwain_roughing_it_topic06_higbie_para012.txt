Higbie, now there was a specimen fit to be framed and hung up over the fireplace for the edification of future generations. Higbie hailed from, well, anywhere and everywhere, I reckon, depending on which bottle had last sung him a siren song. Claimed he’d seen service in the Mexican War, though I wouldn't bet a plugged nickel on it, seeing as how he’d have been but a babe swaddled in diapers at the time. But Higbie, bless his fibbing heart, had a story for every occasion, and they all came out sounding as true as gospel, especially after a tumbler or two of rotgut. He was a man who could coax a laugh out of a gravestone, and a loan out of a miser, though getting that loan *back* was another matter entirely.

His mining skills, however, were about as effective as trying to bail out the ocean with a thimble. He could tell you all about the latest geological theories, spout off fancy terms like "auriferous quartz" and "placer deposits," but put a pick in his hand, and he’d likely hit his own foot before striking gold. Didn't stop him from tryin', mind you. Higbie was the kind of optimist who'd keep panning for gold in a dustbin, convinced he’d strike it rich any minute now. Always talkin' about his "big strike" just around the corner.

And the clothes he wore! Lord have mercy, a scarecrow wouldn't be caught dead in them. Seemed he'd been wrestling with a grizzly and lost, judging by the tears and rips. One couldn’t help but wonder if he possessed a mirror, or perhaps he considered sartorial splendor a sign of weakness. Yet, despite his shortcomings, and they were legion, Higbie had a heart of gold, or maybe it was just fool's gold, I'm never sure which. He’d share his last crust of bread with a hungry dog and give you the shirt off his back, provided it wasn't already missing half the sleeves. A scoundrel, a dreamer, and a lovable old rascal all rolled into one dusty, rum-soaked package. Yes sir, Higbie was something alright; a true original, even if originality was the only thing he actually mined.
