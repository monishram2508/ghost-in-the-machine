A glacier is a colossal, slow-moving river of ice formed from the accumulation and compaction of snow over many years. These icy behemoths are not static entities; they are dynamic systems constantly in motion, sculpted by gravity and influenced by climate. Glaciers require specific conditions to form: cold temperatures that allow snow to persist through summer months, and sufficient snowfall exceeding the annual melt rate. Over time, the weight of the accumulating snow compresses the lower layers, transforming fluffy snowflakes into dense glacial ice. This process, known as firnification, first creates granular snow called firn, and further compression forces out air bubbles, resulting in solid ice. The immense weight of the ice mass exerts pressure on the underlying bedrock, causing it to deform and contribute to the glacier's movement. Glaciers move primarily through two mechanisms: internal deformation and basal sliding. Internal deformation involves the ice crystals themselves slipping and sliding past each other under pressure, a process akin to plastic flow. Basal sliding occurs when a layer of meltwater forms between the ice and the bedrock, lubricating the interface and allowing the glacier to slide downslope.

The landscape shaped by glaciers is distinctive and dramatic. As they move, glaciers erode the bedrock through abrasion and plucking. Abrasion happens when the ice grinds against the rock, using embedded rock fragments like sandpaper to smooth and polish the surface, creating striations and grooves that indicate the direction of ice flow. Plucking, also known as quarrying, occurs when meltwater seeps into cracks in the bedrock, freezes, expands, and breaks off pieces of rock that are then incorporated into the glacier. This process carves out deep valleys, sharp ridges, and towering peaks. Glaciers also transport vast amounts of sediment, ranging from fine silt to massive boulders, which are deposited as till when the glacier melts or retreats. These glacial deposits create distinctive landforms like moraines (accumulations of till along the glacier's edges), eskers (sinuous ridges of sediment deposited by meltwater streams beneath the glacier), and drumlins (elongated hills of till streamlined by ice flow). Glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change, and their shrinking size in many parts of the world is a stark reminder of the impact of rising global temperatures. Studying these icy giants provides valuable insights into past climates and helps scientists to project future environmental changes.
