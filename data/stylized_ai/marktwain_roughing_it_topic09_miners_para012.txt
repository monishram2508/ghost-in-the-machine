Now, these miners, bless their optimistic hearts, were a breed apart, I tell you. They came from every crick and corner of the globe, all drawn by that shiny siren song of gold. There was the Cornishman, perpetually homesick and forever boasting of tin mines deeper than any hole in this blasted Nevada earth. You’d find him in the saloon, singing some mournful ballad about fair maidens and foggy shores, all the while squinting at the faro table like he’d misplaced a clod of dirt. Then there was the Irishman, a cheerful rogue if there ever was one, liable to start a brawl over a misplaced pinch of snuff, and just as liable to buy you a drink afterwards with a wink and a “No hard feelings, mate!” The air would be thick with their brogues, their jokes, and the ever-present scent of stale whiskey and gunpowder. 

They were a superstitious lot, these miners, quick to blame bad luck on a woman in the mine, or a black cat crossing their path. They’d hang horseshoes above their claim entrances, and swear by the power of a lucky nugget, rubbed raw with fervent belief. They’d tell tall tales around the campfire, stories of veins of gold so pure they’d blind you, and of claims so rich they’d make Croesus look like a pauper. Of course, nine times out of ten, those veins proved to be fool's gold, and those claims yielded nothing but dust and disappointment. But did that dampen their spirits? Not a whit. They’d pack up their tools, dust off their pants, and head off to the next promising gulch, their eyes shining with that same unwavering hope. They were driven by the dream, you see, a dream as wild and improbable as finding a unicorn in a saloon. And Lord knows, in this godforsaken land, a man needed a dream to keep him from going plumb loco.
