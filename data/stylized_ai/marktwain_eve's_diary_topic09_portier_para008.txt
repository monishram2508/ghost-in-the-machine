Now, about this portiere, Eve wouldn't you think a body could do better than call it by a name that sounds like a fella’s hauling baggage? I did contemplate that draped thing for a spell, a regular velvet cataract it was, plumb browning at the edges, as if some forgetful soul had left it to bake in the sun for a decade or two. Adam, of course, he says it’s just “decorative.” Bless his heart, he wouldn’t know decoration if it bit him on the… well, never you mind where. He’d probably hang his best fig leaf right next to it and declare it a matched set.

It’s supposed to keep out the drafts, they tell me. As if a few drafts ever stopped anything worthwhile. Why, the best gossip in Eden travels on a draft, and so does the occasional tempting apple aroma. Still, I suppose if a body has a hankering for a room that smells eternally like grandma’s parlor and blocks out all the fresh air, a portiere is just the ticket. It’s got this grand, self-important look, like it’s guarding the secrets of the universe, when all it’s really guarding is Adam snoring in his favorite patch of sunlight.

And the maintenance! Goodness gracious, the dust! One might think it was trapping the sands of time themselves. I tried beating it once, with a stick, like the servants in those books the seraphim keep smuggling in. Land sakes alive, the dust that flew! I looked like I’d been flour-dusted for baking. Adam, he just sneezed and went back to whittling. So there it hangs, a monument to… well, to something. Maybe to humanity’s eternal fondness for things that are fussy, slightly ridiculous, and utterly impractical. Or perhaps it’s just a reminder that even in paradise, there’s always some dusty old curtain to fret about. Makes a body yearn for the simple days of nakedness and unfettered breezes, don’t it?
