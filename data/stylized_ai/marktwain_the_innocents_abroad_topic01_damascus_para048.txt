Damascus, ah, a city whose very name rolls off the tongue like a merchant’s sweetest lie, a confection spun of sunshine and dust. They call it the oldest inhabited city in the world, which, mind you, strikes me as a bit of a brag. Why, I daresay my own hometown of Hannibal, Missouri, feels older every blessed day, especially after a particularly arduous session of whitewashing fences. But Damascus, bless its ancient heart, certainly *looks* the part. One can practically taste the millennia baking in the sun-bleached stones of its walls, a flavor not unlike old parchment mixed with a hint of camel dung – an acquired taste, I assure you.

The streets, now, they are a labyrinth designed, one suspects, by a committee of mischievous djinn, each intent on sending travelers round in circles until they either surrender to the nearest hookah pipe or are devoured by a particularly aggressive flock of pigeons. And the merchants! Lord have mercy on the unsuspecting tourist who stumbles into their clutches. They’ll offer you silks finer than a spider’s whisper, daggers sharper than a politician’s tongue, and spices that smell, well, they smell of Damascus, which is to say a delightful blend of roses, cumin, and the aforementioned camel dung. A fellow could get himself into all sorts of financial trouble in a place like that, I reckon.

But even with the dust, the crooked streets, and the persistent attempts to sell me carpets I neither needed nor wanted, there’s a certain charm to the old girl. You see the history etched in the faces of the people, in the crumbling arches of the mosques, in the faint echoes of ancient caravans rattling through the city gates. It's a place where you can practically feel the ghost of Saladin haggling over the price of a horse, or hear the whispers of Scheherazade weaving her tales to keep the Sultan from, shall we say, losing his temper. So, Damascus, yes, a bit of a dusty old rascal, but a rascal with a story to tell, and a glass of sweet tea to share. And if you happen to stumble upon a particularly persistent carpet salesman, well, just tell him Mark Twain sent you. He'll probably just double the price, but it's worth a try, wouldn't you agree?
