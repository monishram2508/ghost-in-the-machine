Now, Carson City, that's a place! Not quite a city, not quite a town, more like a collection of hopefuls and disappointed dreamers huddled together against the Nevada wind. I reckon I saw more mule teams than streetcars, and more prospectors than politicians, though Lord knows there were enough of both. The place had a raw, unfinished look, like the Lord had started building it and then got distracted by something shinier and left it half-done. Frame houses sprouted up like weeds after a rain, only less organized and considerably uglier. One could practically watch them decay before your very eyes. The sidewalks, bless their optimistic little hearts, were mostly planks laid down on the sand, promising stability but delivering splinters and the occasional sudden plunge into the dust. 

The citizenry was a peculiar lot, a mix of gents who looked like they’d stepped straight out of a dime novel and ladies who looked like they wished they hadn't. Gambling saloons elbowed out the churches, and the air was thick with the smell of stale whiskey and unfulfilled promises. You could hear the clink of silver dollars and the mournful cries of the faro dealers at any hour, a constant reminder that fortune could be made and lost faster than you could say "Jack Robinson." I suspect more fortunes were lost than made, mind you. There was this fella I met, name of Higgins, who claimed he'd discovered the richest vein of silver in the territory, only to lose it all on the turn of a card the very same night. Said he woke up with a hangover and nothing to show for it but a lighter wallet and a newfound appreciation for the virtues of sobriety, which lasted all of a day and a half, poor soul. So, Carson City, yes, a place alright. A place to make a fortune, lose a fortune, or simply lose yourself in the dust and the dreams of the West. Just be sure to keep a sharp eye on your wallet and a bottle of good whiskey handy; you never know what might come your way.
