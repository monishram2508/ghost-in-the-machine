Now, concerning this edifice they call a mosque, a veritable beehive of piety, I must confess I've encountered structures less perplexing in their purpose. Built, as I understand it, for the specific exercise of folks engaging in prayer towards a certain direction, a place where a body may bend and touch their forehead upon the floor more times than a contortionist at a traveling show. These mosques, bless their pointed domes, come in all manner of flavors, some glittering like a sultan's fever dream, others as plain as a Quaker meeting house, suggesting that even the Almighty, in His infinite wisdom, allows for regional variations in taste. One might find inside a cavernous space echoing with chants, as rhythmic and hypnotic as a Mississippi steamboat's engine, and outside, a fellow up on a tower yowling like a lovesick tomcat reminding the faithful of their duty.

And the faithful themselves, ah, a curious bunch! They flock to this holy house like moths to a flame, divesting themselves of their footwear with a haste that suggests their shoes are on fire. Inside, they arrange themselves in neat rows, shoulder-to-shoulder, looking for all the world like a particularly disciplined choir preparing for a particularly fervent hymn. They rise, they bow, they murmur, all in perfect synchronization, a ballet of devotion that would surely stump the most seasoned choreographer. I've seen faces beaming with fervor, faces creased with worry, faces so stoic you'd think they were carved from granite. One can't help but admire their devotion, though I confess, I've always suspected a fellow could get just as close to the divine whilst sitting under a shady oak tree with a good book and a bottle of something that tickles the throat just so. Still, to each their own road to salvation, I reckon, be it paved with marble or a bit of Kentucky dirt.
