Baden, ah, Baden! A place where one's arteries can harden and the purse strings loosen with alarming ease. I found myself there, a lone Adam amongst a flourishing Eve-garden of ladies, all bedecked in feathers and fortunes pilfered from husbands half a world away. The waters, you see, are touted as miraculous, capable of curing gout, boredom, and perhaps even the tendency to utter sensible pronouncements. For a price, of course. Miracles, like fine silk stockings, always command a pretty penny. The town itself is a gaudy jewel box, overflowing with grand hotels that whisper of bygone emperors and courtesans who wielded more influence than crowned heads. One can’t swing a cat – and I trust no one would, especially in a place so meticulously groomed – without hitting a marble fountain or a painted cherub.

The conversations, naturally, were of matters vital to the health of civilization: the scandalous behavior of the Duchess of Whatever-Her-Name-Is, the exorbitant price of Parisian bonnets, and the precise moment one ought to partake of the sulfurous elixir that promised, but never delivered, eternal youth. I observed them all with a detached amusement, these elegant creatures sipping their waters and airing their grievances. It was a spectacle, a meticulously choreographed dance of wealth and ennui. One lady, festooned with enough diamonds to illuminate a small principality, confided in me that her nerves were quite shattered. "Oh, Mr. Twain," she lamented, "the sheer exertion of selecting the perfect shade of lavender for my new carriage is simply devastating!" I nearly choked on my own miraculous water. Apparently, in Baden, the greatest tragedy one could endure was a mildly inconvenient upholstery decision. I suspect if Adam had only taken Eve to Baden instead of offering her an apple, we'd all still be in Paradise, simply too distracted by the exquisite agony of choosing between shades of Eden green.
