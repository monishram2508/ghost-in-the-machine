Now, Morgan, there was a specimen I encountered out in the Nevada Territory, a fella built like a saguaro cactus and about as accommodating. Claimed to be a prospector, but I reckon he’d have trouble prospectin’ for his own nose on his face. Said he’d struck a vein of somethin’ “richer than Comstock,” winked like he had a secret he’d swallowed whole, then proceeded to buy himself the saltiest, greasiest plate of bacon and beans the grub tent could muster. I figured he was prospectin' for a heart attack, myself. He held court at the bar after, tellin' tall tales about nuggets the size of pumpkins and streams flowin' with whiskey. Now, I ain’t no fool, and neither were the other fellas sippin’ rotgut nearby, but we all played along, see? It was worth the price of a watered-down beer just to watch Morgan hold the stage. He had this way of embellishin’ a story, layerin' on the whoppers thicker than mud on a Missouri pig, until you couldn't tell if there was even a grain of truth beneath. One minute he was wrestling a grizzly bear for a claim, the next he was charming a saloon girl with poetry lifted straight from a dime novel. Course, anyone who tried to call his bluff got met with a glare colder than a well-digger's backside in January and a hand inching closer to the pistol nestled in his waistband. So we all just nodded and chuckled, lettin' Morgan have his moment. Truth be told, I suspect he knew we were humoring him. He'd catch your eye sometimes, a glint of pure mischief sparkin' behind those watery blue eyes, like he was sayin', "Alright, fellas, let's see how far I can stretch this yarn." And darned if we didn't always fall for it. Morgan, he was a living, breathin’ fiction, a testament to the power of a good lie and a bottle of cheap whiskey, and out in the wilds of Nevada, that was sometimes all a man needed to make a name for himself. Whether that name was worth salt and beans, well, that's another story altogether.
