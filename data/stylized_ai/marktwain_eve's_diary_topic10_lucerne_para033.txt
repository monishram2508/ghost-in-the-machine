Lucerne, bless its heart, it's a town that tries. It really does. One might say it's trying a tad too hard, like a feller dressing up in his Sunday best for a hoeing contest. All polished wood bridges and picture-postcard views of mountains that look suspiciously like they've been Photoshopped, which of course, ain't invented yet, but you get my meaning. It's too… neat. Too… Swiss. Which is to say, clinically clean and about as surprising as finding another cog in a clock. I half expected the ducks on the lake to be synchronized swimmers, each one preening itself with the same level of meticulous precision as a Prussian general.

The Lion Monument, carved into that rock face to commemorate them Swiss guards, now there’s a melancholy piece of art. A magnificent, suffering lion, looking like it's just realized it left the stove on back in the barn. It's enough to bring a tear to a glass eye, but it's also placed in a park so tidy, you feel guilty for even breathing near it. You almost expect a small man in a uniform with a feather duster to appear and shoo away any lingering dust motes. I saw a tourist drop a gum wrapper there once, and I swear, a collective gasp went through the crowd like a sudden squall.

The shops? Well, they’re full of watches that cost more than a decent-sized farm, and cuckoo clocks that chime with the kind of aggressive cheerfulness that makes you want to strangle a small bird. Don't misunderstand me, it's all very impressive, the craftsmanship, the attention to detail, but it's also… safe. Like a banker's handshake. You know exactly what you're getting, which is precisely nothing to write home about, except to say that yes, you saw it, yes, it was clean, and yes, you're now considerably poorer. It’s a place to appreciate the spectacle of order, to admire the diligence of the Swiss, and then, perhaps, to escape to a slightly less… organized corner of the world, where the chickens run free and the sunsets ain't regulated by municipal ordinance.
