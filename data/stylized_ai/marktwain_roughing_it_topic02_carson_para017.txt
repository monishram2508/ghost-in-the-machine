Carson City, ah, a place where the sagebrush reigns supreme and the politicians, well, they sprout up like weeds in that same sagebrush, thick and prickly. I reckon I’ve seen more dust devils twirling through its streets than I have truly honest men strollin’ them. You could build a fortune here, they say, especially if you’ve got a silver tongue and know the right handshake, which generally means your palm’s greased and the other fella’s got a mine you’re lookin’ to hornswoggle him out of. The main street, well, it tries, bless its cotton socks. False fronts all in a row, pretendin' to be grander than they really are, like a feller wearin’ a silk hat with a hole in his boot. You'll find saloons aplenty, of course, where fortunes are won and lost on the turn of a card or the roll of the dice, and where a man can drown his sorrows quicker than he can drown a cat in the Carson River – which ain’t sayin’ much, seein’s how that river’s generally lookin' more like a creek with a touch of indigestion. The air, dry as a preacher's sermon, and just about as lively, hangs heavy with the promise of silver and the faint aroma of whiskey and disappointment. You see fellers arrivin’ here with stars in their eyes, lookin' to strike it rich, and you see the same fellers leavin’ a few months later with nothin' but a busted dream and dust on their britches. Still, there’s a certain charm to it, I suppose. A rugged sort of charm, like a mule that kicks you in the shins but still manages to haul your ore. It's a place where a man can be somebody, or at least pretend to be until the next hand of poker is dealt. And even if he ain't nobody, nobody cares much, long as he buys his drinks and doesn't cause too much trouble. That’s Carson City for you – a dusty, hopeful, and occasionally scandalous little spot clinging to the side of the mountain, just tryin' to make a dollar like the rest of us.
