Now, Damascus, that ancient serpent of a city, coiled tight in its valley – a place where time appears to have tripped over its own beard and landed face-first in the dust. Why, they say Cain himself laid the first stone, though I wouldn’t bet a plugged nickel on it; Cain, you understand, had a spotty record for construction, what with the whole brother-slaying business taking up so much of his attention. The streets, narrow and crooked as a politician's promise, wind like a dyspeptic snail's trail through the city, threatening to deposit you headfirst into a spice vendor's pile of saffron at any given moment. And the smells! Good heavens, the smells! A delightful – and often overwhelming – cocktail of jasmine, roasting lamb, sandalwood, and something that smells suspiciously like camel dung, all vying for dominance in your nostrils. It's enough to make a seasoned traveler reconsider his decision to possess such a useful appendage.

The people, bless their starched collars and flowing robes, are a curious lot. They haggle over prices with the ferocity of a mother bear protecting her cubs, yet offer you a cup of coffee and a story with the warmth of a desert sun. Their tales, mind you, are often taller than the minarets that pepper the skyline, filled with enough sultans, jinn, and miraculous healings to fill a library, though discerning truth from fancy is akin to separating sand grains with a toothpick. And the Damascus steel! Famed throughout the ages, they say it can cleave a feather floating on the breeze. I tried to acquire a sword, naturally, but after several hours of strenuous bartering and numerous cups of that potent coffee, I ended up with a rather lovely rug and the lingering suspicion that I’d been gently, and quite expertly, fleeced. Such is the charm, and the peril, of Damascus, a city that leaves you both utterly bewildered and utterly enchanted, and more than likely, somewhat lighter in the purse. You leave it feeling like you've lived a thousand years, most of them involving some degree of pleasant confusion.
