Winter, ah, that blustery old coot! She comes on like a thief in the night, sneaky-like, first just pinching the warmth from the air, then slapping you across the face with a blast of wind that’ll make your eyes water and your mustache ice over. Folks around here claim it's a beautiful thing, this winter wonderland of theirs. Well, I reckon they ain't the ones chopping wood before sun-up, their fingers numb as turnips, just to keep the stove from resembling a frustrated volcano. I saw a fella the other day, near frozen stiff, trying to convince a balky mule to pull a sled full of firewood. Mule was having none of it. Just stood there, ears drooped like a wilted daisy, occasionally letting out a mournful bray that seemed to echo the general sentiment of the entire territory.

And the snow! They rave about the pristine, untouched beauty of a fresh snowfall. Untouched, maybe, for about ten minutes before some jackass with a wagon comes along and churns it into a slushy, brown mess. That ain't beauty; that's just plain old inconvenience. Every morning it's the same routine: dig yourself out of your cabin, shovel a path that promptly fills back in five minutes later, and then spend the rest of the day dodging icicles the size of small children falling off the eaves. Then, just when you think you've got a handle on things, the wind decides to pick up and whip that snow around like a swarm of angry bees, stinging your cheeks and burying you alive in drifts so high you'd swear you were in the Himalayas. Honestly, I've seen warmer welcomes at a rattlesnake convention. But then again, when the sun does break through those clouds, even for a minute, and glints off that snow... well, even a cynic like myself can't help but admit, it’s almost pretty enough to make a man forget he hasn’t felt his toes in three weeks. Almost.
