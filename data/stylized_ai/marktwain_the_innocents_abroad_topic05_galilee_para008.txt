Now, Galilee. A right picturesque bit of real estate, no denying that, though if I were a land agent, I reckon I'd have to put a bit of polish on my pitch. They call it the “Switzerland of Palestine,” which is like calling a catfish a cousin to a salmon – technically correct, perhaps, but lacking in the crucial department of dazzlingness. You see, the Swiss have them mountains, those toothy jags of granite that punch holes in the sky. Galilee has hills. Pleasant hills, mind you, all soft and rolling like a drowsy cow in a pasture. You can climb 'em without the aid of a sherpa, and you won’t need an oxygen tank to reach the summit.

The Sea of Galilee, now there's a body of water that gets more press than it deserves. A respectable puddle, certainly, but hardly an ocean. I've seen bigger farm ponds back in Missouri. Still, it's got its charms. The sunsets can be quite fetching, painting the water in hues that’d make a peacock envious. And the fishing? Well, let's just say if you're looking to retire rich on your catch, you might want to consider a career change. Still, I encountered men fishing there, mending nets and telling the same tall tales they've likely been spinning for centuries. I suspect the fish are wise to them by now. I did partake in a boat tour, and the guide filled us up with biblical stories and whatnot. The sort of tales that have been told so many times they've grown smooth and worn like river stones. I'm not one to disparage faith, mind you, but I always find it prudent to keep a skeptic's eye open, just in case the river stone hides a snake. All in all, Galilee is a decent place to spend a day or two, so long as you don’t come expecting the Grand Canyon. A pleasant, unassuming place, best enjoyed with a slow pace and a generous dose of good humor.
