Now, a sepulchre, you see, is just a fancy word for a tomb, though some folks would have you believe it's got an air of the exotic about it, like a pineapple on a parsnip cart. It’s a right impressive thing, usually, carved out of stone, or maybe built up from bricks like a respectable pigsty, and intended to keep the deceased as quiet as possible. Which, one might argue, they're doing quite well already, death being a notorious muffling agent. I’ve seen sepulchres in my travels that would make a Pharaoh blush, all gilded and ornamented like a riverboat gambler's watch. Folks seem to think a grand sepulchre somehow elevates the deceased's character, as if piling on the marble and cherubs can scrub away a lifetime of pettiness and overcharging. It’s like hoping a fancy hat will make a horse a gentleman.

And speaking of character, it’s a curious thing, this need to memorialize. Seems we can’t quite accept that someone just up and vanishes. We gotta carve their name in stone, and maybe add a few flattering lies about their accomplishments. “Here lies Ebenezer Snodgrass, a pillar of the community,” the stone might say, while the community remembers him best for cheating Widder Higgins out of her prize-winning zucchini. But there it is, graven in granite for all eternity. Perhaps it’s for the living, this sepulchre business, to comfort themselves with the notion that something, anything, remains. Or maybe it's just a way to show off. "Look at me," the sepulchre seems to shout, "I'm important enough to warrant this much stone!" Though the occupant, I suspect, couldn't care less if he's buried in a grand mausoleum or under a simple, unassuming daisy patch. He's got bigger fish to fry, or lack thereof, depending on your theological leanings. Either way, a sepulchre is a weighty reminder that we’re all just dust pretending to be diamonds, and sooner or later, the dust settles, fancy tomb or no.
