Now, Carson City. Lord, what a place! A pocket-sized imitation of San Francisco, only without the fog and with considerably more sagebrush clinging to its skirts like a lovesick burro. They call it a city, mind you, but a flock of chickens and a determined jackrabbit could easily cross the entire burg before breakfast. The buildings are mostly frame affairs, slapped together with more hope than skill, leaning this way and that like a bunch of drunks sharing a park bench. Main Street, I reckon it was called, sported a couple of saloons, each vying for the title of "Most Sawdust Per Square Foot," and a general store where you could procure anything from a plug of tobacco to a rusty horseshoe, provided you had the grit to haggle with the proprietor, a man who looked like he'd swallowed a cactus and was perpetually digesting it.

The population, as near as I could reckon, consisted of miners, gamblers, politicians (a breed that seems to flourish wherever a dollar can be fleeced), and a scattering of folks just trying to make an honest living, which in Carson City was about as likely as finding a gold nugget the size of your head just lying on the ground, though everyone, bless their hopeful hearts, seemed to be looking. Evenings, the air was thick with the smell of woodsmoke and cheap whiskey, punctuated by the tinny music of a piano being abused in one of the saloons and the occasional whoop of a reveler convinced he'd finally struck it rich. All in all, Carson was a rough-and-tumble sort of place, full of bluster and bravado, and smelling distinctly of desperation and ambition. A place where fortunes were made and lost with alarming regularity, and where a man could find himself a millionaire one day and cleaning stables the next. I wouldn't say it was a Garden of Eden, but it certainly had more character than a church social, that's for certain.
