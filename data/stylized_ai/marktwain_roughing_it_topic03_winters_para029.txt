Winters in Nevada, now, they're a spectacle, a regular theatrical production put on by Mother Nature herself – only, she forgot to hire any decent stagehands. One day, you're basking in the kind of sunshine that fools you into thinking you're in California, only without the obnoxious accents, and the next, you’re knee-deep in snow that came down thicker and faster than a swarm of locusts descending on a Kansas wheat field. This snow ain’t the fluffy, picturesque kind either; no sir, this is the heavy, wet sort that clings to everything like a lovesick burro, threatening to collapse your roof and turn your beard into a dangling glacier. 

And the cold? Well, the cold could curdle milk at fifty paces. It seeps into your bones faster than a gambler loses his fortune at the Comstock Lode. You try to ward it off with fires that roar and crackle like a runaway locomotive, but it’s a losing battle, I tell you. The only thing warmer than your hearth is the price of firewood, which those lumber barons jack up higher than a flagpole the minute the first snowflake hits the ground. Then there's the wind, which howls like a banshee who's just been told she's out of a job. It cuts right through your thickest coat like it's made of tissue paper, and leaves you wishing you'd invested in a good pair of earmuffs, or maybe just moved south and become a pineapple farmer.

But bless your heart, there’s a certain beauty to it all, in a grim, teeth-chattering kind of way. The mountains, draped in white like dignified old ladies attending a fancy ball, the silent stillness broken only by the occasional yelp of a coyote who's probably regretting his choice of residence, and the cozy feeling of being huddled inside with a mug of something strong enough to melt the ice on your front porch. Still, give me summer any day, when the only things howling are the politicians, and the only things freezing are the prices at the ice cream parlor.
