Winter in these here parts, now that's a spectacle to behold, and one that’s likely to freeze the spectacles clean off your nose, given half a chance. Comes in like a runaway stagecoach, all bluster and threat, leaving a trail of frozen inconvenience in its wake. First you get a little flirtation with frost, a delicate white tracery on the window panes, enough to make the tenderfoots back East start waxing poetic about the beauty of nature. But don't you be fooled. That's just Winter oiling its knuckles, warming up for the main event.

Next thing you know, the snow arrives. Not that gentle, drifting snow you see in them fancy Christmas cards, mind you. This is the kind that comes down sideways, propelled by a wind that sounds like a thousand banshees arguing over a lost poker hand. It builds drifts that could swallow a small cabin whole, leaving you feeling like a mole, burrowed deep under the frozen earth, wondering if you’ll ever see sunlight again. The mercury, it takes a dive steeper than a drunk prospector after a claim jump, and suddenly, every exposed surface – your nose, your ears, your optimistic dreams – feels like it’s about to shatter into a million icy pieces.

And the critters! Lord, the critters. They all disappear, smarter than the lot of us humans, hibernating away like they're in on some secret we ain't privy to. The only creatures you see are the ones desperate enough, or foolish enough, to be out in it – the occasional scrawny coyote looking for a frozen rabbit, or some poor, misguided fella trying to convince his mule that ice fishing is a grand idea.

But don't misunderstand me, there’s a certain charm to it, a kind of rugged beauty, like a grizzled old miner with a heart of gold. After all, winter’s the time when the stories get taller, the whisky flows a little smoother, and the fireside boasts about finding that motherlode sound a little more plausible. Plus, when spring finally thaws out the landscape, you appreciate the sunshine a whole lot more, knowing you’ve survived another winter, and that's worth something, even if it's just the right to complain about the summer heat later on.
