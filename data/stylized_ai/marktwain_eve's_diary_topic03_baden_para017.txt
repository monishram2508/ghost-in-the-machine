Baden, you see, is one of those places that’s quite absurdly proud of being Baden. One might think, judging by the fanfare, that they’d personally invented the cure for consumption, or perhaps discovered a new continent instead of merely possessing a few particularly lukewarm springs. The town itself is draped upon hills like a tipsy dowager in a too-tight corset, all squeezed in and puffed out in unexpected places. The architecture attempts grandeur, but mostly achieves the sort of fussy ornateness that gives one a faint headache after a while. Buildings festooned with balconies like a ship overrun with railings, statues of forgotten dukes with pigeons perched jauntily on their heads, and little parks so prim and proper they practically vibrate with the disapproval of uncouth behaviour.

The air, they say, is salubrious. I confess, I breathed it. Repeatedly, even. But I failed to discern any particular curative properties beyond a general sense of being slightly less annoyed than I was when I arrived. Perhaps I was simply too healthy to appreciate its subtle ministrations. The Kursaal, ah, that's a spectacle in itself! Imagine a gilded cage designed to house the most impeccably dressed gamblers in all of Europe. One sees fortunes won and lost with a terrifying nonchalance, fortunes that, I daresay, could feed a small country for a year. But bless you, they wouldn’t dream of it. They’re far too busy contemplating whether to raise the stakes on the next hand. And the mineral waters? One drinks them, grimaces politely, and pretends to enjoy the experience, all the while inwardly comparing the taste to a particularly rusty nail left to soak in a tepid puddle. Still, it is considered the height of fashion to sip these unpleasant concoctions and discuss the latest scandals with an air of delicate boredom. One must endure such things, I suppose, when one is determined to be thoroughly and demonstrably European. It all strikes me as a rather elaborate, and somewhat damp, charade.
