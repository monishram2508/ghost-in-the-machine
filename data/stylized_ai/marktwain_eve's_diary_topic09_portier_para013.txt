Now, about this portier, or portiere, as some highfalutin’ folks fancy callin’ it. A curtain, mind you, but one with aspirations. Not content to merely shade a window and keep out the pesky sunbeams, oh no, this one must needs hang in a doorway, pretendin’ it's a wall when it ain't. I reckon it's the sort of thing a woman might take a shine to, considerin' how much they love to rearrange things and pretend one room is really two. Adam, bless his simple heart, would likely just scratch his head and wonder why you’d trade a perfectly good door for a flapping piece of fabric that lets drafts sneak in like a mischievous imp.

I’ve seen ‘em decked out in all sorts of finery, too. Velvet, satin, even embroidered with scenes so elaborate you’d think they were tryin’ to tell a whole darn story. Why, I once saw a portier depicting the Great Flood, complete with Noah and his ark lookin' bewildered as all get-out. Gave me a chuckle, it did, thinkin' how the poor man probably had to hang that very curtain up himself, the missus undoubtedly occupied with organizin’ the animal snacks. They are frequently draped with the sorts of fringes and tassels that catch the dust, and one would be a fool to think they should use the vacuum machine to suck the dust away. No, there is the business of a special brush and a long feather duster.

Of course, a portier does serve a purpose beyond lookin' fancy and gatherin' dust. It offers a touch of privacy, though not much more than a wink and a nod. You can peek through the gap on the side, if you're so inclined, and see who's comin' or goin'. And it can muffle the sounds a tad, though if your neighbors are havin' a proper row, you’re gonna hear it regardless. All in all, a portier is a curious creature. It’s not quite one thing or the other, neither a wall nor a simple curtain, but somewhere in between, like a shy smile or a half-remembered dream. It might not be strictly necessary, but it adds a certain something to a room, a touch of…well, I ain’t quite sure what. Maybe just a touch of pretense, and who are we to say we don’t all need a little bit of that?
