Now, this glacier, bless its icy heart, is quite the spectacle. I first laid eyes on it perched up high, like some enormous, frosted cake left out too long in the sun – though thankfully not quite melted to the point of dribbling all over creation. One can’t help but ponder its origins. Did it simply sprout up one day, tired of being a regular mountain and deciding to dress itself in a shimmering gown of frozen water? Or did the Almighty, in a fit of boredom perhaps, scoop up a generous helping of winter and plop it down there, just to see what would happen? I suspect the latter, for what earthly good could such a thing be, if not to entertain the curious observer?

Folks flock from miles around, you see, all wanting a gander at this icy behemoth. They ooh and aah, snapping photographs like they're trying to capture a particularly stubborn butterfly. One fellow, a proper fop if ever I saw one, declared it “sublime!” which, I reckon, is just a fancy way of saying he thought it was pretty. I couldn’t help but wonder if he’d be so keen on its sublimity if he had to actually *chop* some ice off for his morning refreshment. I suspect not.

And the stories! Oh, the tales they spin about this glacier! Some say it grumbles and groans at night, complaining about the summer heat. Others claim it moves ever so slowly, like a drowsy snail, creeping down the mountain to engulf unsuspecting villages. I haven't seen any engulfed villages, mind you, but I wouldn't put it past it. It's got that look about it, a sort of silent, glacial menace. Still, I find it all quite diverting. It’s a reminder that even in this modern age, with its steam engines and telegraphs, there's still room for a good old-fashioned, oversized ice cube to capture our imaginations. And that, my friends, is a blessed relief indeed.
