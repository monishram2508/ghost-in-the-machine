Now, about this Mosque affair, a rather curious contraption of architecture it is, wouldn't you agree? Not a steeple in sight, mind you, but a minaret, poking skyward like a finger wagging good-naturedly at the heavens. I saw one just the other day, a rather imposing fellow, all stone and intricate carving, standing sentinel against the relentless sun. It looked for all the world like a wedding cake that had been deemed too holy to consume. They say these mosques, these places of Muslim worship, are all oriented toward Mecca, a city far, far away, which strikes me as a rather impressive feat of navigation, considering the times. One wonders if they employ a divining rod or perhaps a particularly clever camel with an innate sense of direction. 

Inside, it's a rather different beast from the churches I'm accustomed to. No pews, you see, but carpets spread upon the floor like a floral battlefield where solemnity and comfort wage a perpetual war. And the walls! Covered in calligraphy, swirling patterns that seem to dance before the eye. I'm told it's all verses from their holy book, the Quran, but to me, it looked suspiciously like a flock of elegant, inky birds had taken flight and left their trails upon the walls. The air hangs heavy with the scent of incense, a rather pleasant smell, I confess, though I did wonder if it was intended to mask the scent of a thousand pairs of bare feet, a thought that made me chuckle, I must admit. They all go in for kneeling and bowing, these Muslims, a most strenuous exercise for the uninitiated, I imagine. One would think they were searching for misplaced coins, but no, they are simply showing their respect to their God. A curious custom, perhaps, but no more curious than some of the antics I've witnessed in churches closer to home. All in all, a mosque is a place of quiet contemplation, a refuge from the hustle and bustle of the world. And while I may not understand all the rituals and customs, I cannot deny the feeling of peace that pervades the air, a feeling that reminds me that perhaps, just perhaps, we are all searching for the same thing, albeit in different and equally peculiar ways.
