Lucerne, ah, Lucerne! A right charming place, it is, though not without its peculiarities, like a cat that only purrs when you least expect it. Built on the edge of that there lake, the Vierwaldstättersee, a name so long it sounds like a sneeze in German, it seems determined to mirror the mountains surrounding it, the Pilatus and the Rigi, those craggy old fellows eternally guarding the town’s secrets. And secrets, I daresay, Lucerne does have. Behind those perfectly painted facades and beneath the carefully placed flower boxes (filled with blooms that seem suspiciously perky for enduring such altitudes), there lurks a certain…reserve. It’s as if the town is perpetually trying to be on its best behaviour for the tourists, a performance so flawless it borders on the uncanny.

The Chapel Bridge, naturally, is the star of the show, though slightly charred around the edges, like a gingerbread man left too long in the oven. The painted panels within, those little windows into history, are something to behold, that is, if you can ignore the persistent neck strain from craning upwards. They tell tales of saints and battles and general Swiss sturdiness, all rendered in a style that suggests the artists were either divinely inspired or had simply consumed one too many glasses of Kirschwasser. The Lion Monument, carved into the rock face, is another must-see, a profoundly sad spectacle of a dying lion, purportedly representing the Swiss Guards who perished during the French Revolution. Now, I’m not one to argue with sentimentality, but it does seem a tad dramatic for a country whose primary contribution to the world is clocks and chocolate. One might think they’d carve a cow, or perhaps a particularly intricate cuckoo clock, instead of this morose feline. But there it is, a constant reminder that even in the most picturesque settings, tragedy can still sneak in, like a pickpocket at a parade. Still, I confess, I found a certain charm in the whole affair, a sort of well-preserved, slightly melancholic beauty that only Switzerland, with its penchant for order and its talent for mountain-hugging, could truly pull off. It’s a place that makes you want to buy a postcard, learn to yodel (badly), and contemplate the sheer absurdity of human existence, all whilst nibbling on a piece of Toblerone.
