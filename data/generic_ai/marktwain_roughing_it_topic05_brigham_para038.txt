Brigham Young, often referred to as the "American Moses," carved a significant place for himself in American history, particularly in the context of the Latter-day Saint movement and the settlement of the American West. Succeeding Joseph Smith as the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Young faced the daunting task of leading thousands of followers westward in search of a haven from persecution. He proved to be a pragmatic and resourceful leader, guiding the Saints across the plains with meticulous planning and unwavering determination. His organizational skills were instrumental in establishing the "Winter Quarters," a temporary settlement in Nebraska, which served as a staging point for the arduous journey to the Rocky Mountains. Young’s leadership during this period was crucial not only for the survival of the Saints but also for maintaining their unity and faith in the face of immense hardship.

Arriving in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, Young famously declared, "This is the place," initiating the process of building a new Zion in what was then a desolate desert landscape. He oversaw the systematic development of the region, implementing irrigation systems, surveying land, and establishing towns and communities throughout the Great Basin. Young’s vision extended beyond mere survival; he sought to create a self-sufficient and prosperous society, fostering industries like agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. He also prioritized education, establishing the University of Deseret (later the University of Utah) to ensure the intellectual and spiritual growth of the community. His policies were often guided by his religious beliefs, influencing everything from land distribution to social structure. He also served as the first governor of the Utah Territory, navigating complex relationships with the U.S. government and striving to maintain the autonomy of the Latter-day Saint community. While his legacy is complex and includes controversial aspects, such as the practice of polygamy, Brigham Young undeniably played a pivotal role in shaping the cultural, economic, and political landscape of the Intermountain West. His impact on the region is still felt today, evident in the infrastructure, institutions, and values that characterize many communities in the area.
