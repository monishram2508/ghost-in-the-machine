Genoa, ah, Genoa! A city that clings to the Ligurian coast like a barnacle to a ship's hull, all elbows and crammed alleyways. You wander its labyrinthine depths, expecting to stumble upon a secret society or a particularly enterprising rat at any moment. The place seems determined to confuse you; the streets twist and turn with the capriciousness of a politician's promises, leading you past shops brimming with pesto (enough to flavour the entire Atlantic, I reckon) and enough focaccia to sink a galleon. The houses, all painted in shades that would make a rainbow blush, lean in conspiratorially, as if sharing a joke about the poor tourist hopelessly lost amongst them.

One can't help but feel a bit sorry for the sun, forever struggling to pierce the shadows cast by those towering buildings. It pops in for a quick hello and then scurries away, defeated. And the laundry! It festoons every balcony, a glorious, flapping banner of domesticity. One imagines the Genoese ladies, perched precariously on their windowsills, hurling witty insults and damp garments at each other in equal measure. The harbour, well, that's a sight to behold. A chaotic dance of fishing boats, ferries, and yachts, each jostling for position like a gaggle of geese vying for a dropped crust of bread. The air is thick with the cries of seagulls, the salty tang of the sea, and the faint but persistent odour of fish – a perfume, perhaps, for a seafaring man. They say that Christopher Columbus hailed from here, a claim I'm willing to believe, seeing as how only a man accustomed to such disorienting streets would dare to set sail for uncharted territories. A place of contradiction, Genoa is: a city of grandeur and grime, of beauty and befuddlement. You'll either love it or loathe it, but either way, you won't soon forget it. It clings to the memory like a stubborn burr on a traveller's coat.
