So, I reckon I spent a spell out there in Utah, among the Mormons, and a curious bunch they are, a right mix of earnest and peculiar. You'll find plenty of folks back East who’d have you believe they’re a species unto themselves, three horns and cloven hooves, mind you. But let me tell you, scratch the surface, and you'll find humans just like anywhere else, only maybe a touch more inclined to bake you a pie, or, heaven forbid, ask if you've considered the merits of the Book of Mormon.

Now, I ain’t one to judge a man for his beliefs, seeing as how I’ve held a few peculiar notions myself, particularly after a night with a bottle of rye whiskey and a philosophical argument with a mule. But this here religion, it’s a whole different kettle of fish. Angels and golden plates and a prophet receiving revelations on a hill – it all reads like a dime novel penned by a fella with a fever dream. Yet, you can’t deny the conviction these folks possess. They built Salt Lake City out of a dust bowl, irrigated the desert, and sing hymns with such gusto, it’d put a choir of bullfrogs to shame. 

And their dedication to the "principle" – plural marriage, that is – well, it used to be a sight to behold. These days, they pretend that bit never happened, claiming the government forced them to quit. You see some of those old timers with a whole flock of daughters that all look like the same woman, and your imagination starts to wander. It also must be mentioned that despite the rumors, the women seem none the worse for wear, and plenty happy. They’ll feed you a stack of flapjacks so high, you’ll need a ladder to reach the top, and they'll smile at you the whole time, as if you aren't stuffing your face with enough food to feed a small army. All in all, I wouldn't wish to convert and go through with it, but if one does, they will be met with kind souls and amazing baked goods.
