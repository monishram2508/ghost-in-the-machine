Now, about this fella, Morgan, you see. A specimen peculiar to the West, mind you, and about as predictable as a Nevada dust devil. Claimed to be a prospector, though I never saw him wield a pickaxe with the zeal of a man actually huntin' gold. More like he was huntin' for shade and a bottle of whiskey. Had a beard that looked like it'd swallowed a whole damn prairie dog and a squint that could curdle milk at twenty paces. Dressed perpetually in clothes that seemed to have lost a fight with a particularly ornery tumbleweed. He was, in short, the picture of dilapidated independence.

Morgan, you see, was a talker. Oh, Lord, could he talk. Stories upon stories, piled higher than the Sierra Nevada, and just as likely to contain a healthy dose of fabrication. He'd spin yarns about lost mines overflowing with silver, shootouts with desperadoes who all sounded suspiciously like him, and encounters with Indians so noble they practically demanded he write a pamphlet about their virtues. Whether any of it was true was anybody's guess, and frankly, nobody much cared. The entertainment value alone was worth the price of a whiskey or two, which, incidentally, was how he usually got started. 

He possessed a cunning that was both admirable and slightly unsettling. He could charm a rattlesnake into lending him its skin for boots, or convince a barfly that a ten-dollar gold piece was actually only worth five. Not that he was necessarily dishonest, mind you. He just had a flexible relationship with the truth, like a rubber band stretched to its breaking point. One time I swear I saw him sell a blind man a telescope, swear I did. But then again, perhaps the man was just looking for a new perspective, and Morgan, ever the entrepreneur, was merely providing it. Such was the riddle wrapped in a tattered coat that was Morgan, a Western original if ever there was one, a walking, talking tall tale best enjoyed with a pinch of salt and a healthy dose of skepticism.
