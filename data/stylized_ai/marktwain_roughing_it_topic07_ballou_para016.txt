Ballou, now there's a specimen. A tenderfoot so green, you could mistake him for a particularly vigorous sagebrush after a good rain. Came out West, he did, seeking fortune, adventure, and I suspect, a good excuse to wear a ludicrously large hat. Likely read too many dime novels back East, filling his head with notions of shootouts at high noon and finding gold nuggets the size of watermelons. Reality, as usual, had a different story to tell. I first laid eyes on him in Virginia City, him clinging to a mule that looked just as disgruntled as I felt after a week without whiskey. He was draped in enough fancy leather and dangling accoutrements to outfit a small cavalry unit, though he couldn’t hit a barn door with a howitzer.

He claimed to be a lawyer, fresh out of some Eastern academy, though his attempts to explain legal jargon to a jury of miners sounded more like a drunken argument with a dictionary. He did, however, possess an uncanny knack for stumbling into trouble. Seems like every time I turned around, Ballou was wrestling a runaway pig, being chased by a flock of particularly aggressive chickens, or explaining to a burly prospector that no, he did not mean to imply his claim was worth less than a rusty tin pan. The man was a walking, talking calamity, a one-man vaudeville act. Yet, bless his naive heart, he never lost that wide-eyed optimism. He'd dust himself off, adjust that ridiculous hat, and declare with unwavering conviction that tomorrow would be the day his luck changed. And confound it all, sometimes it did. Not in the way he expected, mind you. He never struck it rich, nor did he become the next Clarence Darrow of the Comstock. But he did, in his own bumbling way, manage to bring a bit of laughter and light to a land that could be as bleak and unforgiving as a banker's heart. And in these parts, a little laughter is worth more than all the gold in California.
