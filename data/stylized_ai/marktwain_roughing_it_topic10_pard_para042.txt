Pard. Now, there's a word that clings to the tongue like dust after a dry spell. You wouldn't hear it back East, unless maybe some feller was mimicking the stagecoach driver in a dime novel. Out here, though, it's thick as sagebrush, and just about as useful, depending on the pard in question. I've seen pards thick as thieves, sharing grub and gold like they were both born with a silver spoon – only the silver spoon was usually a rusty tin one they'd dug up near Virginia City. I've also seen pards ready to shoot the hide off each other over a misplaced jackknife or a particularly fetching claim jumper named Lulu. Human nature, I reckon, ain't changed much since Adam blamed Eve for the apple. 

My own pards? Well, they've been a mixed bag, truth be told. There was "Whispering" Johnson, who couldn't whisper to save his soul but could sure as thunder eat a whole side of beef in one sitting. Then there was "Professor" Peabody, who claimed to know Latin but mostly just used big words to confuse folks into thinking he knew what he was doing – usually when gambling or trying to sell swamp land as prime real estate. He once tried to convince a Piute brave that a deck of cards was a portable library. Didn't end well for the "Professor," let me tell you. Course, he did manage to trade the brave for a particularly fine mule. 

A pard ain't always about sharing the wealth, mind you. Sometimes, it's about sharing the misery. Sharing the biting wind on a winter night, the scorching sun in the desert, the dysentery after eating that questionable canned fruit. It's about having someone to curse the gold-durn blasted mosquitoes with, and someone to help you drag your sorry carcass back to camp when you break your leg chasing a runaway burro. Yeah, a pard. Sometimes, they're the only thing standing between you and a lonely grave out in this godforsaken land. And sometimes, they're the reason you end up there in the first place. It's a gamble, this pard business, like everything else out West. But it's a gamble most of us are willing to take. Because even a bad pard is better than facing the silence alone.
