Now, these Mormons, a peculiar bunch, they are. Dwellin' out there in the Salt Lake Valley, makin' a kingdom right out of the desert, which ain't somethin' you see every day. They're industrious, I'll give 'em that. Never seen such irrigation, such order, springin' up from nothin' but dust and devotion. Brigham Young, the Moses of the place, a fellow with an eye for business and a heart, well, that’s up for debate, ain’t it? Claims divine inspiration, which is convenient, to say the least. He's got more wives than hairs on my head, and that's sayin' somethin', seein' as how I ain't exactly wearin' a full thatch these days.

Polygamy, now there's a topic to chew on. Can't rightly say I understand it, all that sharin' and carousin' and whatnot. Seems like a heap of trouble to me. Though I heard tell of one feller who claimed it was the secret to long life – less work for each wife, he figured. Sounded like a fella tryin' to talk himself into somethin', if you ask me. They say it's all about buildin' up the Kingdom, multiplyin' and replenishing, just like the Good Book says. But between you and me, I suspect there's a bit o' plain old human nature mixed in with the theology.

They got this Book of Mormon, see, which they reckon is just as good as, if not better than, the regular Bible. Angels and golden plates and lost tribes of Israel wanderin' around America. It's quite a story, I'll admit, even if it does sound a bit… imaginative. But who am I to judge? Folks believe all sorts of things, especially when they're lookin' for somethin' to believe in. They're a-building, these Mormons, and a-prayin', and a-workin'. And whether you agree with 'em or not, you gotta admit, they're makin' their mark on this world, one adobe brick, and one blessed wife at a time.
