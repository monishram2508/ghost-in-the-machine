Well, I reckon I spent a spell in Utah, back when Brigham Young was still the bee in that particular bonnet, and a peculiar lot they are, these Mormons. A body couldn’t swing a cat without hitting a prophet, or a wife of one. It was a regular swarm of 'em, thicker than locusts in a Kansas wheat field, all buzzing about obedience and Zion this, and Zion that. You’d hear tell of revelations and golden plates, dug up from the ground like potatoes, writ in a language no man livin' could decipher save for the chosen few. And bless their pious hearts, they took it all down as gospel, hook, line, and sinker.

They were industrious folk, no doubt about that. Turning that dusty desert into something resembling a garden, irrigatin' and plantin' like there was no tomorrow. I saw 'em build temples grand enough to make Solomon blush, and all with a straight face and a hymn on their lips. Hard workers they were, except when it came to believin’ the most outlandish stories. Seemed the more far-fetched it was, the easier they swallowed it whole. It's a curious thing, this faith. Like a blind mule heading downhill, it just keeps goin', logic be damned. 

Polygamy, of course, was the real kicker. A man with wives enough to populate a small town. I met one fellow who claimed to have twenty-seven! Said it was a great responsibility, keeping all their names straight, let alone their birthday. Sounded like a fate worse than death to me. But they swore it was all for the glory of God and the perpetuation of the saints. I kept my mouth shut, of course. A man learns to keep his opinions to himself when outnumbered twenty-seven to one by angry women. All in all, they were a strange bunch, these Mormons, a right peculiar mix of hard work, fervent belief, and a hankering for multiple spouses. But I reckon every land has its oddities, and Utah, well, it just had more than most.
