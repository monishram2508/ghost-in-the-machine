Damascus, ah, Damascus! A city old enough to have forgotten its own birthday, and likely older than Methuselah’s dentures, if he’d bothered with such fripperies. They say it's the oldest continuously inhabited city on the planet, which is a polite way of saying it's been stubbornly clinging to life longer than a barnacle on a pirate ship's hull. One could imagine Adam himself, fresh from the Garden – a place, I suspect, much less dusty – strolling through its souks, haggling over the price of a fig leaf. And likely getting swindled, the poor innocent.

The city’s a veritable labyrinth, mind you. Narrow, winding alleys twisting like a politician’s promises, and smelling of everything from jasmine and rosewater to spices you can’t quite name and something faintly resembling the back of a camel. One could easily get lost in it, and I daresay some have, only to reemerge years later, utterly convinced they'd discovered a new continent populated entirely by carpet sellers.

And the people! Bless their hearts, they are a breed apart. Traders and artisans with eyes that twinkle brighter than the gold they peddle, and a penchant for storytelling that would make Scheherazade blush. You ask them for directions, and they'll happily oblige, provided you have several hours to spare and a fondness for digressions involving their uncle's cousin's near-death experience involving a donkey and a runaway cart of pomegranates. Every man is a poet, a philosopher, and a con artist all rolled into one glorious, turban-topped package. They’ll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge made of baklava, and you’ll thank them for the privilege, only realizing later that you've been had. But by then, you'll be too charmed to care.

The whole city is a dusty, chaotic, beautiful, exasperating, utterly unforgettable mess. Like a beloved old uncle who drinks too much raki and tells tall tales, you can't help but be fond of it, even when it's driving you utterly mad. One leaves Damascus with a lighter wallet, a heavier heart, and a suitcase full of memories that are likely more romantic than accurate, but that's half the fun, isn't it? Yes sir, Damascus is a city that leaves its mark, even if that mark is just a lingering aroma of shisha and the faint suspicion that you’ve been royally fleeced.
