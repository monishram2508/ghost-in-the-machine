Them miners! Lord, what a breed. You’d think a feller spending his days chipping away at the bowels of the earth would be a somber sort, but bless you, no. They were the durnedest collection of optimists and outright liars this side of the Mississippi. A miner fresh off a dry spell, his pockets flatter than a pancake and his face grimier than a chimney sweep’s, would still swear he was just one more blast away from hitting the Mother Lode, richer than Croesus himself. And you’d almost believe him, what with the fervor in his voice and the way his eyes lit up like a struck match. Then he’d borrow a dollar off you for grub, and you wouldn’t see hide nor hair of him 'til the next Saturday night when he was buying drinks for the whole saloon, flush with cash he probably borrowed from some other unsuspecting soul.

Their get-ups were a sight, too. Half the time, they looked like they'd been wrestling a badger down a coal chute. Imagine a man, dirt-streaked from head to toe, wearing a hat that looked like a deflated beaver, a shirt ripped in more places than it was whole, and boots that had seen better days before Noah built the Ark. Then they’d strut around like peacocks, swaggering into town with a confidence that bordered on delusion. And their stories! Oh, the stories they’d tell, embellished and exaggerated beyond all recognition. Gold nuggets the size of hens' eggs, tunnels crawling with silver like ants on a sugar cube, claims so rich they could pave the streets of San Francisco with gold dust. You had to take it all with a grain of salt, of course, maybe a whole shaker-full, but that was half the fun. Truth was a fickle thing out West, especially when it came to miners and their tales of fortune. You just listened, chuckled, and figured somewhere in that tall tale there might be a speck of reality, buried as deep as their gold.
