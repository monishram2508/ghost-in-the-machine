Heidelberg, bless its heart, is a town that seems to have been expressly designed for the romantic sensibilities of poets and tourists alike, a confection so quaint one half expects to find gingerbread men peering out from behind the half-timbered houses. The castle, ah, the castle! It stands upon its hill like a grand old duke, though one suspects a bit too much wine has been consumed, judging by the way its sandstone face is crumbling into such a picturesque ruin. Indeed, the whole place feels ever so slightly... staged. As if the burghers of yore anticipated our arrival and carefully arranged the cobblestones just so, ensuring that every possible angle would yield a postcard-perfect vista.

One wanders through the Hauptstrasse, that bustling thoroughfare, jostled by a symphony of languages and the occasional street performer attempting to serenade one with a lute. A lute! Heavens, where does one even *find* a lute these days? But there it is, as perfectly incongruous as a top hat at a picnic. And the students, bless their youthful exuberance! They seem to float through the town in a perpetual state of mild inebriation, their cheeks flushed with beer and philosophy, ready to debate the meaning of life or the proper way to sing a drinking song at the drop of a hat. It's all rather charming, of course, until one realizes that the cobblestones are murder on the feet, the beer is surprisingly expensive, and the lute player seems intent on following one everywhere. Still, one can't help but be swept away by the sheer, unadulterated romance of the place. Heidelberg, it seems, has a knack for turning even the most cynical soul into a sentimental fool, at least for an afternoon. It’s a bit like biting into a marzipan heart, delightful but ultimately, well, a bit too sweet for regular consumption.
