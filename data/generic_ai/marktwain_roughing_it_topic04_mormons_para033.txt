The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, emerged from the religious landscape of 19th-century America, founded by Joseph Smith in 1830. Central to their faith is the belief in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, which they consider another testament of Jesus Christ and a record of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. This scripture details visitations of Christ after his ascension and provides a narrative of a divinely inspired civilization. Joseph Smith, seen by members as a prophet, translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates he claimed to have received from an angel named Moroni. Mormon theology emphasizes a restoration of the original Christian church, believed to have been lost after the death of the apostles. This restoration includes restored priesthood authority, enabling them to perform saving ordinances such as baptism and temple sealings.

A key tenet of Mormonism is the doctrine of eternal families, believing that family relationships can continue beyond death through temple ordinances. Temples hold a significant place in Mormon worship, serving as places for sacred covenants and rituals performed for both the living and the deceased. These ordinances, including proxy baptisms for the dead, are central to their belief in the salvation of all mankind. Mormon missionaries, recognizable by their distinctive appearance, play a crucial role in spreading their message globally, often serving for two years at their own expense. They engage in community service and proselytize, sharing their beliefs and inviting others to learn more about the Church. Mormon culture often emphasizes strong family values, community involvement, and adherence to a health code called the Word of Wisdom, which encourages avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and other harmful substances. The Church has grown substantially since its founding, evolving into a worldwide religion with millions of members and a notable presence in various aspects of society.
