Brigham, now there's a spectacle for sore eyes and a balm to the soul, or maybe a sting, depending on your particular brand of lemonade. I saw him once, perched on a rostrum higher than a church steeple, a regular Moses overseeing his promised land, only this one promised polygamy and a desert bloom where cacti used to reign supreme. A stern visage he wore, face craggy as a Utah canyon wall, eyes that could bore a hole clean through a buffalo hide. He spoke slow and deliberate, each word a deliberate pebble tossed into the still waters of the assembled masses, ripples of fervent nods and amens spreading through the crowd like a prairie fire in a dry season. The faithful, bless their simple hearts, ate it up like sugar candy, hanging on every syllable as if it were manna from heaven, never mind the fact that manna in this case seemed to involve building an empire out of salt flats and hard work.

They say he had more wives than a sultan had gold coins, a veritable harem in hand-stitched bonnets and homespun dresses. Some whispered they were all smitten, others claimed it was a form of religious taxation. Who am I to judge? I'm just a humble observer, scribbling down the oddities of life with a half-sharpened pencil. But one does wonder how a feller manages to keep all those names and birthdays straight, let alone remember who gets the prime rib on Sunday. I reckon that's the kind of logistical nightmare that’d drive a lesser man clean daft, but Brigham, he just kept building, kept preaching, kept populating the wilderness with enough little Saints to make a preacher weep with envy. He was a force of nature, that Brigham, a whirlwind of piety, practicality, and a frankly astounding reproductive capacity. A man who could look at a barren desert and see not just a field of opportunity, but a field overflowing with wives, children, and the kind of devout labor force that could make a railroad baron jealous. Some called him a prophet, others a despot. Me? I just called him interesting. Terribly, wonderfully, confoundingly interesting.
