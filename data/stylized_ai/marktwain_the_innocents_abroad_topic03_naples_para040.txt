Naples, ah, Naples! A city, mind you, thrown together with the apparent intention of giving both angels and devils a good belly laugh. One imagines the Lord, after meticulously crafting the rest of Italy with an artist’s loving hand, simply tossed the leftover bits and bobs at this bay and declared it “done enough.” The streets, good heavens, the streets! They are a chaotic ballet of donkey carts, sputtering motor-carriages, and pedestrians with the disconcerting habit of stepping directly into one's path while offering fervent prayers to some unseen deity. One is perpetually on the verge of being run down, squashed flat, or simply absorbed into the swirling vortex of Neapolitan humanity.

And the noise! It is a cacophony that would make even the most seasoned New York barkeep blush. Hawkers shriek the virtues of their wares – mostly suspect-looking seafood and vegetables that seem to have enjoyed a brief, unhappy life – while street musicians assault the ears with mournful mandolin tunes. The air itself vibrates with the relentless energy of a thousand conversations happening simultaneously, all at the top of their lungs and punctuated by the occasional explosion of a firecracker, the purpose of which remains a mystery to me. The whole effect is rather like being trapped inside a particularly rowdy Italian opera, one where the libretto has been misplaced and the performers have all taken leave of their senses.

But bless my soul, there is a certain irresistible charm to the place. It is a charm that stubbornly clings to the city, despite the grime, the clamor, and the distinct possibility of contracting a novel form of intestinal ailment. The Neapolitans, despite their apparent disregard for order and hygiene, possess a zest for life that is both admirable and slightly unnerving. They greet each day with a hearty laugh, a plate of spaghetti, and a complete and utter disregard for the petty inconveniences of existence. It is, in short, a city where one feels simultaneously exasperated and utterly alive. A place where, upon departing, one vows never to return, and yet finds oneself secretly yearning to return again, just to be thoroughly confounded by its glorious, maddening chaos. A bit like falling in love, I suppose, with a particularly flamboyant and unreliable rogue.
