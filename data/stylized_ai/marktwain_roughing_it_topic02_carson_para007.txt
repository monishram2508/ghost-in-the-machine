Now, Carson City. Lord have mercy, Carson. A more forlorn, God-forsaken collection of shacks clinging to a hillside I reckon I've rarely laid eyes upon. They called it a city, mind you, but I've seen better settlements grow up around a stray mule carcass. The main thoroughfare, if you could call it that without insulting the very concept of thoroughfares, was wide enough for a stagecoach and a nervous jackrabbit to pass each other at a gallop, which, incidentally, was about the average speed of commerce in that neck of the woods. Buildings, if you can dignify those hodgepodges of planks and optimism with that term, sprouted up at random, as if thrown from a dice cup by a drunken miner with a fondness for mismatched angles. One might find a fancy saloon, all mirrors and brass, cheek-by-jowl with a stable smelling powerfully of manure and disillusionment. The air itself tasted of dust, ambition, and the faint, lingering scent of busted dreams. I swear I saw a tumbleweed trying to collect a debt outside the assay office.

The citizens, bless their souls, were a sight to behold. Miners, of course, their faces etched with the geography of hard work and disappointment, swaggered about with pockets full of hope and the general air of men who hadn't seen a bathtub in far too long. Gamblers, slick as eels and just as trustworthy, dealt cards with a deceptive air of casualness, fleecing anyone foolish enough to sit at their table. Politicians, of course, were thick as flies on a summer carcass, each promising to make Carson the next San Francisco while quietly lining their own pockets. And the ladies! Well, let's just say their dresses might have seen better days, but their spirit, like a stubborn desert cactus, refused to wither. They were, I suspect, the only thing holding that ramshackle excuse for civilization together, stitching it with threads of grace and fortitude. All in all, Carson was a place you wouldn't want to raise your children, but a place you'd likely tell stories about for years to come, if only to remind yourself you survived it.
