Now, a sepulchre, you say. A right fancy word for a tomb, isn't it? Reminds one of those fellows who wear cravats and pronounce words with an extra syllable just to show they know the sound of it. But don't let the highfalutin name fool you, a sepulchre is just a hole in the ground, or sometimes, if the deceased was particularly important, a hole in a rock dressed up with some carvings and perhaps a mournful angel or two. I've seen 'em all, from the humble little mounds marked with a simple stone to those grand mausoleums that look like they’re trying to compete with the clouds. Seems a rather foolish competition, if you ask me. After all, the clouds haven't died yet, and that's rather the point of a sepulchre, wouldn’t you say?

They are often built in remote places, far from the hustle and bustle of life. I imagine it’s meant to provide some peace and quiet for the departed, but knowing human nature as I do, I suspect it's also to keep them from bothering the living. Can you imagine if all those ghosts decided to show up for supper every night? There’d be no room for the rest of us at the table. The Egyptians, now there were some fellows who knew how to build a proper sepulchre. Pyramids, mind you! Big enough to make a modern king feel rather insignificant. Of course, they also stuffed those things with enough gold and jewels to solve all of the country's economic problems, which is why grave robbing is almost as old as graves themselves. There’s irony for you, laying down for eternity, only to be robbed blind. Perhaps they should have just spent the money while they were alive, seems a more sensible approach to immortality in my book, leaving behind a legacy of laughter and generosity, rather than an empty treasure chest and a dusty old skeleton. After all, what good is gold to a corpse? It certainly won't buy him a second chance at life, no matter how prettily it's arranged around his bony fingers.
