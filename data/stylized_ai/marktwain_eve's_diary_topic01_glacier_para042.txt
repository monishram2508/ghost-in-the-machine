I’ve been studying these glaciers up here in what they call the “Ice Age,” though frankly, if this is the height of the fashion, I'd rather be back in the Garden, thank you very much. They’re enormous, these glaciers are, like a river that got caught mid-yawn and decided to take a nap for a few thousand years. Adam says they're made of snow, compressed so tight it turns to ice. Seems a bit far-fetched to me, all that snow somehow turning into something substantial. It’s like telling me a whole flock of chickens could squeeze themselves into a single goose egg – preposterous!

Of course, Adam, being a man, is quite taken with them. Calls them "powerful agents of erosion," which I suspect means they make the landscape look untidy. He’s been chipping away at one with his little hammer, muttering about "striations" and "terminal moraines." Honestly, you'd think he discovered fire instead of a few scratches in the dirt. I tried to explain to him that a good bit of landscaping with some nice ferns would do the trick quicker, but he just rolled his eyes and went back to his moraines. Men and their hobbies!

But I must admit, there is a certain grandeur to them. They creep along at a snail's pace, grinding away at the earth and leaving behind these curious valleys and mountains. I saw a bird fly into a crevasse the other day – a long crack in the ice, deep as you please. It made me wonder, are these glaciers like big, icy sieves, filtering out the unwanted creatures from the landscape? Probably not. More likely, the bird was just plain foolish. Still, it's a thought, isn't it? It seems like God has quite a sense of humor, planting these frozen behemoths just to keep Adam entertained with a hammer and a puzzled expression. What a peculiar world indeed.
