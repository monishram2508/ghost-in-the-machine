Now, concerning these mosques, which are, as I gather, the divinely-sanctioned clubhouses of the Mohammedan persuasion, I confess a certain bewilderment, not entirely dissimilar to that experienced when observing a politician attempting to explain the national debt. One sees, of course, the towering minarets, those skinny exclamation points against the azure heavens, seemingly shouting, “Look at me! I’m taller than your church steeple!” A bit immodest, perhaps, but let's not begrudge them a bit of architectural chest-thumping. Inside, it's a wholly different affair. Vast, open spaces, often bereft of pews – which strikes me as sensible; pews are but an invitation to doze during a sermon, and I reckon their preachers are hardly less prone to inflicting somniferous pronouncements than our own. Instead, there's rugs aplenty, inviting the faithful to prostrate themselves like supplicants pleading for a winning lottery ticket. And bless their hearts for it. 

The architecture, mind you, can be quite something. Domes that swell like well-fed pumpkins, mosaics shimmering with a thousand colors, calligraphy that flows like poetry – although, alas, I can't decipher a blessed word of it. It's all rather impressive, even for a fellow who prefers his religious experiences accompanied by a pipe and a comfortable armchair. But, the real spectacle, I find, is not the bricks and mortar, but the men within. Rows of them, bending and rising in unison, their voices chanting in harmony. It’s a sight to behold, even if one doesn't understand the words, the dedication is hard to dismiss. One cannot help but be reminded that, much like the human animal, these buildings are but stage dressing, to the greater drama of human belief and belonging. Whether that drama plays to enlightenment or to folly, well, that's a question best left to the philosophers. I myself, am far too busy trying to untangle the mysteries of a decent whiskey sour.
