Damascus, they say, is the oldest city in the world, older than Methuselah’s beard and considerably more crooked. One stroll through its bazaars is enough to convince a fellow that time here ain't marching, it's meandering, stumbling, and occasionally collapsing in a heap of dust and the faint smell of spices. The air hangs thick and heavy, mind you, a veritable stew of donkey, jasmine, and something suspiciously like ancient laundry. You'll be accosted by merchants selling silks so fine they could shame a spider's web, and carpets that look like they were woven by genies during a particularly ambitious opium dream. 

Now, these fellows are characters, I tell you. They’ll swear on the beard of the Prophet that their imitation ruby is real enough to blind a king, and their copper teapot could brew tea for Solomon himself. Bargaining with them is a game of wits, a contest of mendacity, a regular sport that could test the patience of a saint, assuming a saint could handle the incessant offers of sweet, sticky baklava thrust directly into his face. One chap, bless his soul, tried to convince me that his rusty scimitar had once belonged to Saladin, conveniently overlooking the fact that Saladin was buried some eight hundred years ago, and this particular blade looked like it had seen more action peeling potatoes.

The streets themselves are a labyrinth, a tangled skein of alleys where a man could get lost looking for his own nose. One minute you're admiring a mosque shimmering like a mirage in the midday sun, the next you're being squeezed past a camel laden with firewood and a gaggle of children chasing a particularly resilient chicken. Don’t be surprised if a goat decides to make a deposit on your boot; it’s considered good luck, or so the locals will tell you, all the while struggling to stifle a giggle. And just when you think you've figured the place out, a call to prayer will echo through the city, a sound so haunting and beautiful that it'll send a shiver down your spine, reminding you that underneath the chaos and the clamor, Damascus is a city with a soul, a soul as old and as complex as time itself.
