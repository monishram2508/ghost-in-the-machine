Now, Carson City, that’s a place to write home about, though likely home wouldn’t much care. You see, she sits perched there, a sort of forgotten hen clucking away in the shadow of the Sierras, doing her level best to look important, being as she’s the territorial – no, *state* capital now, by thunder. Built on dreams of silver mountains and the industrious clatter of the Comstock, she’s seen better days, mark my words. Why, I remember when you could practically pan nuggets off the main street – though that might be a touch of exaggeration, a storyteller's liberty, you understand.

You’ll find the houses squatting low to the ground, mostly plain affairs, as if embarrassed by the vast, glorious mountains breathing down their necks. And the streets? Wide enough for a stagecoach race, which is probably the intent, seeing as they never got around to paving them proper. Dust devils dance a jig down there, a constant reminder that Mother Nature still runs the show. The inhabitants are a curious breed, too. A scattering of politicians, looking important and full of secrets nobody much cares about. Some miners, sun-baked and leathery, still chasing that one big strike that’ll buy them paradise, or at least a decent bar tab. Then you've got your assortment of lawyers, quicker than greased lightning when it comes to separating a man from his coin. And, of course, a fair number of folks just trying to make an honest living, which is harder in Carson City than finding water in the desert, I reckon. They're a friendly enough bunch, though, always ready with a tall tale and a wink, even if half the stories are borrowed from the last feller who passed through. Yes sir, Carson City, a place you visit, nod politely to, and then head on out of, richer in experience and, perhaps, a bit poorer in pocket, depending on how many hands you shook and how many games of faro you got suckered into.
