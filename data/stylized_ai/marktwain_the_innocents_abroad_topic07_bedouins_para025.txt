Now, about these Bedouins, these children of the desert – a whimsical lot, I must say, akin to tumbleweeds with aspirations. I encountered them flitting across the sands, draperies billowing like a politician's promises, riding upon steeds that could outrun even the most persistent tax collector. One might be tempted to call them nomads, and rightly so, for settled they are not, bless their restless souls. Their tents, spun from goat hair, you see, are as mobile as a traveling salesman, popping up one day amidst dunes like mushrooms after a rain (though rain in those parts is scarcer than honesty in a horse trader), and vanished the next, leaving nary a trace save perhaps a lingering scent of camel dung and the echo of a rather spirited argument over the price of a date. 

Their diet, I suspect, consists mainly of dates, goat's milk, and whatever unfortunate locusts happen to stray too close to their campfires. One fellow I met swore that he could live for a month on nothing but the dew collected from a camel's nostril, though I'm inclined to think he was pulling my leg – a habit quite prevalent among these desert denizens. They've a keen eye for spotting water where I’d see nothing but shimmering mirages, and possess the uncanny ability to navigate by the stars, which is all well and good until you realize they're also using those same stars to justify their exorbitant prices for a sip of that precious H2O. They claim a lineage stretching back to the very dawn of time, these Bedouins, each one a direct descendant, apparently, of some celebrated sheik who single-handedly wrestled a sandstorm and won. I wouldn’t doubt it for a minute, mind you, for these fellows have a certain swagger, a confidence born of generations spent staring down the face of oblivion and laughing in its sandy teeth. A curious bunch, these Bedouins, resourceful and resilient as old boots, and just as likely to kick you in the shins if you're not careful with your haggling.
