Well, I reckon I’ve seen glaciers before, mostly in pictures, mind you, because the places they tend to reside in ain’t exactly the most hospitable for a delicate creature such as myself. But I did take a gander at one of the behemoths up in the mountains when Adam and I had our little excursion north some time back. A glacier, you see, is a right peculiar thing, all icy and grand, like a frozen waterfall that took a century or two to finally give up on the falling part. It's mostly a big, blue-ish slab of ice, all wrinkled and crevassed like an old man’s face, and just as slow in its movements too, I should think. Adam was captivated by its immensity, the way it seemed to dwarf everything around it, which naturally made him feel smaller in comparison, which always amuses me since his ego needs no help. He pointed out the moraines and whatnot, those jumbles of rocks the glacier so thoughtfully drags along, like a lady with too many baggage carts, and told me all about how they carved out valleys and shaped the earth. I nodded along, pretending to be interested, although I mostly wondered if it was possible to slip on one of those things and slide all the way down the mountain like a grand, icy toboggan run. The whole enterprise struck me as a grand, if somewhat chilly, example of nature showing off. It was a big display, but at the end of the day, it was just frozen water. Though, I reckon the sheer size is kind of astounding if you consider it, but what’s even more astounding is how something so powerful can be so fragile, you just gotta warm things up a little bit and it'll be gone. Seems to me it's just another one of life's little ironies.
