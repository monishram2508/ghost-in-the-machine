Now, about this here portier, or portière, as the Frenchified amongst us might insist on calling it. A right fancy name for a simple curtain hung in a doorway, if you ask me. Though, I suppose, anything smells sweeter with a bit of perfume, even if it’s only linguistic. Eve did fancy naming things, after all, didn't she? Back in the garden, naming every beast from the lowly earthworm to the roaring lion, though I reckon she might've asked for a bit of help if she'd stumbled across a tapir. Quite a mouthful that would've been. But I digress. This portier, you see, is meant to keep out the drafts, the nosy neighbors, and the harsh realities of the world. A sort of fabric shield against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, though I suspect it's mostly just dust and cat hair it’s protecting us from.

They say it adds a touch of elegance, this portier does. Makes a room feel all the more cozy and refined. But truth be told, I reckon it's mostly just a tripping hazard. I’ve nearly taken a header over the blasted thing more times than I care to admit. And don't even get me started on the dog. He thinks it’s a game, leaping through it with the glee of a circus performer. A rather clumsy circus performer, mind you, one likely to send the whole tent a-tumbling. The color, they tell me, is ‘burgundy,’ a shade of red I suspect only a grape could truly appreciate. Makes the whole room look like a slightly tipsy saloon, ready for a brawl and a singalong. Yet, there it hangs, this portier, a silent observer to the comings and goings of our little world. A testament to our unending quest to complicate the simple, and to make a mountain out of a molehill, or in this case, a drafty doorway. It might just be a curtain, but it’s our curtain. And, bless its cotton heart, it does try.
