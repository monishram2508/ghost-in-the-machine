Carson City, bless its little, dusty heart, is a curiosity, ain't it? A capital it calls itself, perched up there like a sparrow on a flagpole, though you'd hardly guess it from the goings-on. Why, I've seen tumbleweeds bolder than most politicians in those parts, and that's saying something. It's got the look of a town that threw itself together one Saturday afternoon with whatever scraps were lying around – a bit of mining camp, a dash of pious hope, and a whole heap of desert. The main street, if you can call it that, stretches out like a tired ol' dog, yawnin' at the sun, with saloons standin' shoulder to shoulder like they're conspirin' to soak every last dime out of the poor souls comin' in from the Comstock.

Now, they'll tell you it's a place of high society, where laws are made and fortunes whispered about in hushed tones. Maybe so. But I reckon most of the laws are made after a few too many fingers of whiskey at the Ormsby House, and the fortunes are mostly whispered about by folks who ain't got any. You'll find more genuine gold teeth than genuine gold mines in Carson City, that's a fact. I once saw a fella try to pay for his supper with a nugget he found in his beard, and the waitress, bless her soul, just sighed and said, "Is that all you got, hon? 'Cause we don't take hopes and dreams here, only hard cash, or somethin' shiny enough to pawn.” The whole place is like a half-remembered dream, a blurry photograph of a grand idea that got left out in the sun too long. But, darned if it isn't got a charm all its own. A fella can sit on the porch of a evenin', watch the sun sink behind the Sierra, and listen to the coyotes singin' their mournful ballads. And for a minute, at least, he can almost believe that Carson City is somethin' special, even if it's just special in its own peculiar, dusty, slightly ridiculous way.
