Well, pard, I reckon I've seen my share of "pards" out here in this here, dusty landscape, and let me tell you, the breed ain't exactly cut from the same bolt of cloth. You got your quiet pards, the kind that nod along while you spin a yarn about that grizzly you wrassled—though, mind you, they've likely never seen a bear closer than a wood carving back East. Then there's the blowhards, bless their hearts, with a vocabulary as expansive as the Nevada desert and a story for every tumbleweed that blows by. They'll tell you about their gold strike, the one they're just about to stumble upon, or the silver mine richer than Solomon's, conveniently located just over that next ridge, 'round a bend, and past a minor obstacle or two.

And then you got your downright scoundrels, pards in name only, the kind who'd lift the hair off a bald man if given half a chance. They'll slap you on the back with one hand while pickin' your pocket with the other, leaving you whistling "Dixie" with a lighter purse and a whole lot less faith in human nature. I recall one fella, went by "Honest" Hank, no less, swore he'd been struck by lightning seven times and miraculously survived each jolt. Said it gave him the power to smell gold a mile away. Come to find out, that "gold smell" was just a bottle of cheap cologne he liberally applied to his whiskers, and his luck was more akin to winning the lottery by having someone else buy the ticket. But a pard is a pard, or so they say. At least until he tries to run off with your mule and your best prospectin' pan, then he becomes somethin' quite different altogether, somethin' usually followed by a scattering of buckshot. Still, even the rascal ones, they offer a kind of entertainment, wouldn't you say? Keeps the days interesting, and the nights spent watchin' my back, just in case they got plans for to make off with my beans.
