Now, this Colosseum, as they call it, a rather ostentatious pile of stone, I must say, though time, that grand old democrat, has certainly taken a few liberties with its appearance. One can imagine the gladiators, those burly chaps in their skimpy getups, prancing about for the amusement of the Roman rabble, roaring like lions at the prospect of a good scrap. Lions, by the by, were sometimes actually involved, a practice I find a tad excessive, even for entertainment purposes. Seems a rather drastic measure for a bit of light-hearted amusement, don’t you think? I daresay, one could just as easily have pitted two politicians against each other, the results likely just as satisfying, and infinitely more beneficial to the general public.

And the emperors, perched up there in their fancy boxes, lording over the spectacle like well-fed peacocks. One wonders what went through their heads as they gave the thumbs-up or thumbs-down, sealing a man’s fate with a flick of the wrist. Probably thinking about the next course of their dinner, if I know anything about emperors. It's a sobering thought, though, isn't it? That such grand power could rest on such fickle whims. Makes a body want to invest in the bread-baking business, something a bit more reliable.

But look at it now, this behemoth of entertainment, half-crumbled, worn smooth by the relentless caress of centuries. The wind whistles through the empty archways, whispering tales of blood and thunder, of roaring crowds and fallen heroes. And the cats, bless their scavenging little hearts, seem to have inherited the place, padding about the ruins with an air of quiet ownership that quite puts the emperors to shame. In the end, I suppose, all empires crumble, and all spectacles fade, leaving behind only the bones of grand illusions. And the cats, of course. Always the cats. They, I suspect, will outlast us all.
