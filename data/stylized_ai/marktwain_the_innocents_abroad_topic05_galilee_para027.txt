Now, Galilee. A region they call it, though calling it a topographical puzzle box might be nearer the truth. Picture, if you will, a land blessed, or perhaps cursed, with hills aplenty – hills that rise and fall like a restless sleeper’s chest, and valleys that seem to have been carved out by a particularly petulant giant with a blunt spoon. Why, a man could get lost in Galilee simply by sneezing at the wrong moment and finding himself tumbled into a ravine he never even suspected was lurking nearby. The Sea of Galilee, they say, is a “sea.” A sea, mind you, that a decent duck could swim across in a morning without breaking a sweat. I’ve seen puddles in Missouri bigger, and with more character, if you ask me. But I digress.

This little puddle, for puddle it is, is framed by these same confounded hills, giving it an air of being trapped, like a goldfish in a rather scenic bowl. Capernaum, Tiberias, Bethsaida – names that roll off the tongue like pebbles down a hillside, each town perched precariously on the water's edge, looking for all the world as if they might slide into the drink at any moment. The people, bless their hearts, are simple folk, fishermen mostly, with faces weathered by sun and wind until they resemble cured leather. They speak in parables, apparently, though I confess I understood precious little of it, being more accustomed to the straightforward, no-nonsense language of a good poker game. They fish. They pray. They argue, I imagine, about the best bait or the price of olives, just like folks anywhere else. And they have a story or two to tell about a certain fellow who used to wander these parts, a carpenter, I believe, with a knack for spinning yarns and calming the occasional tempest. Galilee. A place to lose yourself, provided you're not overly fond of straight lines, large bodies of water, or straightforward conversation. A curious place, indeed, and not entirely without its charm, like a mule with a twinkle in its eye.
