Well, I reckon I spent a spell out in Utah, where the Mormons do congregate, thick as fleas on a mangy dog. These Latter-day Saints, as they fancy themselves, are a curious lot, a regular human menagerie if you ask me. They’ve got this Brigham Young feller, who, by all accounts, had more wives than a sultan has concubines, a notion that tickles some men's fancy, whilst fillin’ others with a sort of moral indigestion. Now, I ain't one to begrudge a man his comforts, but fifty-odd wives? Seems a right heap of trouble just to keep track of birthdays and hairpins.

They're a thrifty bunch, these Mormons, always workin’ like beavers to make the desert bloom, irrigatin' and plantin' till the land spits out enough harvest to fill ten barns. And they’re honest, too, mostly. Wouldn't trust 'em with my gold watch, mind you, but then, I wouldn't trust nobody with my gold watch unless I had both eyes on 'em and a loaded derringer under the table. But generally speaking, they are straight shooters in business.

Their religion? Well, now that's a horse of a different color. They claim to have found gold plates buried in the ground, written in a language nobody understands, which only their prophet could decipher. Sounds like the sort of tall tale you’d spin after a bottle of whiskey and a bad hand of poker, but they swear by it, bless their cotton socks. They believe in all sorts of things, from baptizing the dead to buildin' temples bigger than a Mississippi steamboat. They strike me as well intentioned folk, a bit gullible perhaps, but no more loony than some of the revivalist preachers back East yellin' about fire and brimstone. All in all, if you don't meddle in their affairs, they won't meddle in yours, and a man could do worse than spend a winter among 'em, so long as he keeps his gold watch close, his opinions closer, and his eye on the main chance.
