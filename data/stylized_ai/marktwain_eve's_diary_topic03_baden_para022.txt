Baden, ah, Baden! A place where one can observe the human animal at its most peculiar, and perhaps, most earnest in its pursuit of pleasure. It is a veritable gilded cage for those whom fortune has smiled upon, and occasionally, frowned, but discreetly, behind a fan of feathers. The air itself seems to shimmer with the expectation of winning, losing, or at the very least, being seen. One encounters more crowned heads than one might find in a deck of playing cards, though these, alas, are often attached to shoulders rather less regal than the head would suggest. I’ve witnessed dukes with the posture of stable boys, and countesses who seem to have borrowed their manners from a particularly obstreperous parrot. The baths, of course, are a spectacle in themselves. Imagine, if you will, humanity bobbing like so many overripe peaches in a lukewarm broth, each convinced of the curative power of the mineral waters. They’ll sip the vile concoction with a pious expression, all the while discreetly fanning themselves with a handkerchief that probably cost more than my entire wardrobe. And the casinos! A veritable vortex of hope and despair, where fortunes are made and unmade with the speed of a conjurer's trick. I saw one poor fellow, a baron I believe, lose enough in an evening to pave a respectable-sized street in gold. Yet, he maintained an air of nonchalance that would have done credit to a seasoned undertaker. He simply shrugged, adjusted his cravat, and ordered another bottle of champagne, as though the loss were merely a minor inconvenience, akin to misplacing a glove. It is a place, Baden, where appearances matter above all else, and one must be eternally vigilant lest one’s own appear less sparkling than those of one’s neighbors. One almost feels obliged to commit some minor indiscretion, simply to have something interesting to gossip about later. It’s that sort of place, a beautiful, ridiculous, utterly captivating sort of place.
