Slade, now there was a town that could curdle milk just by lookin' at it. A finer collection of hardcases and highwaymen I ain’t never laid eyes on, not even in Virginia City at its roughest. Picture it, if you will: a scattering of clapboard shacks clingin’ to the banks of the Platte like ticks on a mangy dog, each one emanatin’ a whiff of stale whiskey and unwashed ambition. The wind howled through them streets like a lost banshee, carryin' with it the echoes of gunfights and the faint scent of cheap cigars. Why, even the dogs in Slade looked like they’d swallowed a dirk or two, and the chickens pecked with the grim determination of a man huntin' gold.

I reckon the whole town was a study in contrasts. You'd see a feller preachin' repentance on a barrel in the mornin', then pullin' a knife in a saloon brawl by evenin'. And the women! Bless their hearts, they were tougher than a boiled owl. They could out-curse a mule skinner and out-gamble a riverboat shark, and likely did both on occasion. One time, I saw a lady calmly stitchin' up a gunshot wound while simultaneously dealin' faro, never missin' a beat. Said the feller she was fixin’ had insulted her bonnet. Can't say I blamed her, that bonnet *was* mighty fetching.

Slade was the kind of place where a man could lose his reputation, his money, and his teeth all in one night, and still wake up feelin' lucky to be alive. Of course, that was only if he woke up. More often than not, a feller found himself sleepin’ a whole lot deeper, six feet under the very dirt that had so readily swallowed his hopes and dreams. It was a hard life, but it was honest, in its own peculiar, twisted way. And you know what? I wouldn’t have missed it for all the gold in California. Not that I *found* any gold, mind you, but the stories I gathered? Well, them's worth more than all the nuggets ever plucked from the earth. Leastways, that’s what I tell myself when I'm short on cash.
