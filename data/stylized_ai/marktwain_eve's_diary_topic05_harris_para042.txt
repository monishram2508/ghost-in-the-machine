Now, Harris, bless his cotton socks, was a specimen you wouldn't find duplicated anywhere 'twixt here and kingdom come. A feller of peculiar angles, both inside and out, like a patchwork quilt stitched together by a committee of lunatics. He possessed a mind that worked on the principle of the perpetual-motion machine, only instead of generating energy, it generated schemes. Mostly harebrained ones, mind you, though he’d defend each and every one with the tenacity of a terrier clinging to a rat. He was a walking encyclopedia of misinformation, Harris was, prone to declaiming pronouncements on subjects he clearly knew less about than a babe knows about calculus. And the more profound the topic, the more egregious his errors. He once held forth for a solid hour on the migratory habits of the common brick, quite convinced that they hibernated in chimneys during the winter months. 

He fancied himself a bit of a sportsman, did Harris. Fishing, hunting, you name it, he'd mangle it with gusto. But his aim was so atrocious that he couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn if he was standing inside it. One time, out hunting for squirrels, he managed to shoot his own hat off his head – twice! The squirrels, naturally, expired of laughter long before they were in any real danger. Yet, despite his many shortcomings, and believe me, they were legion, Harris had a heart as big as a church bell, albeit one that rang slightly off-key. He was generous to a fault, loyal to a degree that bordered on the absurd, and possessed a certain unshakable optimism that could charm the birds right out of the trees, or at least, convince them to build their nests a bit further away from his general vicinity. He was a conundrum, wrapped in a riddle, tied with a bow made of pure, unadulterated foolishness, but you couldn’t help but find the darned fool oddly endearing, like a stray mutt with a lopsided grin and a penchant for chewing on your boots.
