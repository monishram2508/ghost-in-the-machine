Them miners, bless their sun-baked souls, were a breed apart, I tell you. A feller could spot one clear across Virginia City, even if he was plumb buried up to his neck in sagebrush and alkali dust. They had this way of swaggering, like they’d personally wrestled a mountain lion and won, which, knowing some of 'em, might well be true. Their trousers were always patched, and not in no fancy, decorative way, mind you – these were patches of necessity, born of crawling through crevices barely wider than a badger’s burrow. And the beards! Lord, the beards! Some were red as fire, some black as a raven’s wing, and some a sort of disconcerting gray-brown, like a biscuit left too long in the oven. Each one held enough dried mud and quartz dust to construct a respectable bird’s nest.

They talked loud, they argued louder, and they drank the loudest of all. Why, I recall one time seeing a miner, name of Silas, drink a whole bathtub full of whiskey. Of course, it was a small bathtub, one of those tin affairs, and Silas was mostly legs, but still, impressive. They were perpetually hopeful, convinced that tomorrow’s dig would unearth a vein of silver thicker than a mule's rump. This belief, naturally, was fuelled by copious amounts of saloon whiskey. I reckon every fool claim from here to Placerville was staked on such a conviction. And you couldn't tell them otherwise. Try to advise them about geology or some such fool thing and they’d just look at you like you were proposing to teach a pig to play the piano. Best just to nod, smile, and maybe offer them another shot of rotgut. It’s a whole lot safer that way. In fact, living amongst them for years, I have come to believe they are the most interesting collection of characters that ever managed to stumble their way west of the Mississippi River.
