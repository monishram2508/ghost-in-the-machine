Higbie, now there was a specimen fit to be mounted and exhibited in a museum of curiosities, right alongside a two-headed calf and a genuine Fiji mermaid. He was a feller built along the lines of a scarecrow after a particularly enthusiastic crow convention, all elbows and knees and a permanent slouch that suggested he was either contemplating the mysteries of the universe or just plumb tuckered out from the sheer effort of breathing. Higbie, you see, had prospecting in his blood, only it had curdled something fierce. He'd been roaming these here Nevada hills for nigh on thirty years, chasing the elusive phantom of the Comstock Lode, and the only gold he'd managed to unearth was in the form of fool's gold and the occasional glittering nugget of delusion. He was a regular encyclopedia of useless mining lore, able to recite the properties of quartz like poetry and identify every ore from gossan to galena, but as for finding a paying vein? Well, he had about as much luck as a politician promising honest taxes.

He wore a hat that looked like it had been through the Washoe zephyr one too many times, and his beard, Lord bless it, was a veritable bird sanctuary of dust and dried grass. He moved with the slow, deliberate gait of a tortoise contemplating a marathon, and when he spoke, it was in a voice that sounded like gravel gargling with whiskey. He was forever discovering "sure things," veins that were "practically pure silver," and "bonanzas that would make John Mackay weep with envy." Of course, these treasures always turned out to be about as real as a temperance lecture in a saloon. Yet, Higbie never lost hope. He was a living testament to the indomitable spirit of the prospector, the kind of feller who'd keep digging even if he struck water in hell. He was a failure, alright, but a glorious, stubborn, and utterly unforgettable failure, a man who proved that the pursuit of fortune, no matter how ill-advised, was a grand adventure in itself, and just about as likely to leave you richer than a lizard in a gilded cage.
