Zermatt, you see, is the sort of place that’d make even the most confirmed city slicker pause for a moment and consider chucking it all for a life of yodeling and fondue. But just a moment, mind you. The air is so clean, it’s practically sterile, a refreshing change from the soot and scandal of more civilized locales. The Matterhorn, well, it sits there like a king on his throne, all craggy and imposing, daring you to even *think* of scaling it. And folks do try, of course, which is a grand bit of sport for those of us watching from below, sipping our Glühwein and placing bets on who'll make it past that particularly treacherous bit of ice. They say it's majestic, a spiritual experience. I say it's a rather large pile of rock, but a photogenic one, I grant you. The town itself is entirely car-free, which is delightful, unless you happen to be lugging steamer trunks filled with Parisian gowns and ostrich feathers up the cobblestone streets. Then it becomes less delightful and more akin to a forced march. The primary mode of transport seems to be electric buggies, driven by fellows who look perpetually exasperated and one wrong turn from driving their contraptions right off the edge of a cliff, which, I confess, I wouldn't entirely mind witnessing. One feels, in Zermatt, rather like one has stepped into a snow globe, carefully shaken and perpetually perfect. Perhaps a little *too* perfect. I suspect there’s a hidden clockwork mechanism whirring beneath the snowdrifts, diligently maintaining the illusion of Alpine paradise. And the prices! Good heavens, one practically needs to rob a bank to afford a simple cheese sandwich. Still, it's all terribly charming, in a way that makes one want to simultaneously applaud the ingenuity of it all and flee back to the comforting chaos of a good, old-fashioned grimy city. One could certainly spend a fortune here trying to look like one is suffering hardships on a mountaineering expedition, when really one is simply attempting to find a decent bar without spending more than one's annual income.
