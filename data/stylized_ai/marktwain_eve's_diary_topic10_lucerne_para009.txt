Lucerne, you say? Well, bless my star-dusted spectacles if it ain’t just another one of those picture-book Swiss towns. You see ‘em strung along those sapphire lakes like beads on a dowager’s neck, all promising milk and honey and enough scenery to choke a sentimental cow. Folks come flocking, primed to have their innards tickled by picturesque grandeur, and, by George, Lucerne delivers! Why, the Reuss River just gurgles right through the place, all pert and self-important, like a busybody gossiping at a church social. And the Chapel Bridge, that ancient, covered thing, draped with paintings older than Methuselah’s rocking chair, is just the ticket for a romantic stroll – provided you can elbow your way through the herd of tourists snapping photos with their infernal contraptions.

I tell you, that bridge’s paintings are a caution. Depicting the triumphs and tribulations of Lucerne’s past, they do. Some of 'em are faded something fierce, but the stories they whisper are sharp as a widow’s tongue. Of course, nobody looks up, though. They’re all too busy posing with the Water Tower, a squat, hexagonal structure that looks suspiciously like a rather disgruntled pepper shaker. But I don't blame 'em, the views are worth the effort.

Then there’s the Lion Monument, carved right into the rock face, supposedly representing the Swiss Guards who got chewed up and spat out during the French Revolution. A noble sentiment, sure, but that lion looks less like a martyr and more like he’s got a splitting headache and a touch of indigestion from eating too many tourists. All in all, Lucerne is a right pretty place, and I dare say it lives up to its reputation. It's the kind of spot where you can drink in the beauty until you feel like a freshly painted landscape yourself – just try not to swallow too much of the self-importance along with it.
