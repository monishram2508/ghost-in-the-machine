Gibraltar, bless its heart, is a promontory so puffed up with self-importance it considers itself a nation, though one suspects a particularly ambitious pebble could make a similar claim. It stands there, a lump of limestone daring the Mediterranean to do its worst, bristling with cannons that, one imagines, haven’t seen honest work since Nelson enjoyed a spot of bother with the French. And oh, the history! Every conquering nation worth its salt has apparently had a go at seizing it, resulting in a veritable archaeological layer cake of fortifications. One stumbles over Roman ruins one moment, then almost trips on a Georgian battery the next, all the while dodging the amiable though brazen apes who consider the whole place their personal banana plantation.

The town itself clings to the western flank like a limpet to a rock, a hodgepodge of red phone boxes and tapas bars, where the Queen’s English tangles delightfully with the lilting Spanish tongue. One half expects to see a Grenadier Guard sharing a plate of paella with a flamenco dancer. The shopkeepers, bless their entrepreneurial souls, are possessed of a talent for selling precisely that which no reasonable person could possibly need – endless replicas of the Rock itself, naturally, along with duty-free perfumes strong enough to fumigate a small country. The whole place exudes a sort of determined anachronism, a stubborn refusal to acknowledge that the age of empires is, for the most part, over. It's a place where the past clings like the salty spray from the sea, and the present is rather like a slightly bewildered tourist trying to find a decent cup of tea amidst the clamor of history and the chatter of monkeys. And yet, one cannot help but find a certain charm in its defiant peculiarity, this little chip off the old, very old, block. One leaves Gibraltar feeling as though one has just witnessed a rather elaborate and delightfully absurd theatrical production, starring a rock, some apes, and a remarkably persistent sense of Britishness.
