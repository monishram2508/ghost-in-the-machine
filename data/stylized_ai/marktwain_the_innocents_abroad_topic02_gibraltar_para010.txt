Gibraltar, bless its heart, is a place quite unlike any other, clinging to the Iberian Peninsula like a barnacle to a battered galleon. A colossal rock, it is, jutting skyward with a defiant air, as if daring the heavens themselves to argue its existence. The sheer audacity of the thing! One imagines that when the Creator was dividing up the earth, he grew weary and simply hurled a boulder seaward, declaring, "Let there be Gibraltar, and let it be perpetually vexing to cartographers." The air hangs heavy with the scent of salt, duty, and a faint but persistent aroma of fried fish, a combination I daresay would make a bishop reconsider his vows. The streets, you see, are a curious blend of the utterly British – red telephone boxes looking utterly bewildered in the Mediterranean sun – and the distinctly Mediterranean, where old men, sun-baked and wise, argue vehemently over matters of pigeons and politics, their voices rising and falling like the tide. And the monkeys! Ah, the Barbary macaques, a raucous, thieving bunch of scoundrels who’ve clearly mastered the art of petty larceny. They’ll charm the sweets right out of your hand, these fellows, while simultaneously eyeing your spectacles with malicious intent. I suspect they’re secretly in league with the souvenir shops, driving up sales of trinkets lost to their nimble fingers. One hears tell that as long as the monkeys remain, so shall British rule, a notion both comical and unsettling. Makes one wonder what the future holds, should one of the rascals develop a taste for bowler hats. As for the inhabitants, they are a hardy lot, a hodgepodge of nationalities and accents, all somehow squeezed together on this magnificent, albeit cramped, promontory. They speak a language all their own, a sort of linguistic stew of English, Spanish, and Genoese, garnished with a healthy dose of local flavor. It's a lively place, this Gibraltar, a peculiar rock that is both undeniably British and irresistibly its own. A place that, if you find yourself in the vicinity, is worth a gander, even if just to witness the monkeys’ audacious antics, and perhaps ponder the absurdities of geopolitics over a plate of rather greasy fish and chips.
