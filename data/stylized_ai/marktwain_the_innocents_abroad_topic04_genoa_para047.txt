Genoa, ah, Genoa! A city built, one might suspect, by the very sea itself, flung together haphazardly like driftwood after a particularly boisterous storm. It clings to the Ligurian coast with the tenacity of a barnacle, a veritable vertical jumble of buildings stacked upon each other, so narrow and winding the streets are that a stout man might be excused for believing he's being slowly squeezed into oblivion. One navigates these alleys not so much by sight, for the sun rarely penetrates this labyrinthine gloom, but rather by scent - a powerful cocktail of brine, basil, and something indefinably ancient and perhaps a little dubious. The architecture is, well, let's just say it's got character. From grand palazzi, remnants of a bygone era when Genoa fancied itself a queen of the sea (a claim, I dare say, only slightly less audacious than calling a walrus a ballet dancer), to humble, crumbling tenements that look as though they might collapse into the sea at any moment.

The Genovese themselves? A shrewd lot, they are. They possess a certain… economical bent, a frugality so deeply ingrained it borders on suspicion. One senses they measure out their smiles with a dropper and count their blessings with a calculator. Yet, beneath this somewhat austere exterior lies a warmth that only emerges after one has successfully navigated their famously intricate haggling practices. Then, and only then, will they offer you a sliver of focaccia (and, heaven forbid, should you ask for more). Their accent, too, is a curious thing – a rapid-fire melody that sounds suspiciously like they’re trying to get a bargain even when simply ordering a coffee. And the port, oh, the port! A chaotic ballet of sailors, merchants, and the occasional suspiciously shifty-eyed individual. It’s a place where fortunes are made and lost, where empires rise and fall (metaphorically, of course, although one wouldn’t be entirely surprised to see a small empire or two sink beneath the waves in that particular harbor). Genoa, then, is not a city for the faint of heart, but for those with a taste for the peculiar, the paradoxical, and the undeniably Italian, it offers a peculiar charm that is both exasperating and utterly unforgettable. Just be sure to hold onto your wallet, and perhaps learn a few choice phrases for bartering. You'll thank me later.
