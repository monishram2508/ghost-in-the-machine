Now, a miner, bless his greasy soul, is a creature apart, you understand. Not quite human, not quite beast, but somewhere in between, like a badger dipped in lamp oil. He's got a pick in one hand and a dream in the other, and usually neither of them's worth a plugged nickel. You find 'em scattered about these here mountains like so many tumbleweeds, each one convinced he's about to stumble onto a vein richer than Croesus himself. They’ll tell you about the “color” they saw, the “indications,” the whisperings of the earth itself urging them onward. Don’t believe a word of it. It’s usually just a thirst for rotgut and the conviction that luck is just around the next bend, clinging to their britches like burrs.

They live in hovels fit only for field mice, sustained by beans and the occasional jackrabbit, and their conversation revolves entirely around claims, quartz, and the perfidy of claim-jumpers. A more suspicious lot you never did see. One miner won't even loan another a pinch of snuff, fearing he'll steal the secret of his 'bacca and find his fortune. They’ll bicker and swear over a fleck of gold smaller than a gnat’s eyelash, and then turn around and gamble away a week's wages on a game of faro.

And Lord, the stories they tell! Each one taller than the last, filled with nuggets the size of goose eggs and veins that stretch clear to China. Most of it’s plumb foolishness, of course. I swear I once heard a fella claiming he dug up a diamond the size of a doorknob, and when I called him on it, he just winked and said it must've evaporated in the sun. But there's a certain charm to it, this unwavering belief in the impossible. It’s what keeps them digging, keeps them hoping, even when the earth seems determined to swallow them whole. And every once in a while, just often enough to keep the dream alive, one of 'em strikes it rich, proving that even a blind hog finds an acorn now and then.
