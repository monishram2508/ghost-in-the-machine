Slade, that alkali dust-hole squatting out there in the Nevada Territory, well, it ain’t exactly Paradise, and that's putting it milder than a parson’s lemonade. Imagine a landscape scraped raw by the devil himself, then sprinkled with enough sagebrush to choke a mule, and you're halfway there. The other half? That’s the people – a collection of characters that would make a circus freak show look positively… well, *normal*. You had your stagecoach drivers, tougher than boiled owl and about as friendly, spitting tobacco juice with the accuracy of a sharpshooter. Then there were the gamblers, pale as ghosts from late nights and cheap whiskey, shuffling cards and trying to skin each other alive over a game of faro. And of course, the ladies – bless their painted faces and feather-duster boas – doing their darnedest to bring a touch of civilization to a place that seemed determined to resist it with all its might.

The air itself tasted like dust and desperation, seasoned with a pinch of hope that clung on like a burr in a donkey’s tail. The buildings, mostly made of clapboard and good intentions, leaned against each other for support, looking like a bunch of drunken cowboys after a particularly long night at the saloon. Speaking of which, the saloons were the lifeblood of the town, the only places where a man could forget, for a precious hour or two, that he was stuck in the middle of nowhere, digging for silver that might not even be there. You could hear the tinny piano music and the raucous laughter all the way across town, a siren song luring men into the warm embrace of liquid courage and the fleeting promise of fortune. Slade, I tell you, it was a study in contradictions: a monument to ambition built on sand, a place where dreams went to either strike it rich or die a slow, dusty death. I'd sooner wrestle a grizzly with one hand tied behind my back than spend another winter there, but I'll be damned if I don't have a soft spot for that hard-scrabble little town and the lunatics who call it home.
