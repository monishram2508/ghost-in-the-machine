Naples, ah, Naples! A city that assaults the senses like a particularly aggressive street vendor hawking questionable wares. One arrives expecting the romance of Italy, the sun-drenched skies and crumbling beauty sung of in countless operas, and finds...well, a bit of that, certainly. But seasoned with a healthy dose of chaos and a distinct aroma that hovers somewhere between fried dough and something one might generously describe as "ancient history." The streets, bless their haphazard souls, are a thrilling obstacle course for both man and machine. A carriage, drawn by a horse whose spirit clearly yearns for greener pastures, might narrowly avoid a collision with a scooter ridden by a gentleman carrying what appears to be the entire contents of his nonna's pantry on his lap. Pedestrians dart in and out of the fray, offering prayers to whatever saint happens to be in vogue that particular hour, while simultaneously negotiating prices with merchants whose enthusiasm is inversely proportional to the quality of their merchandise. The buildings themselves are a study in architectural anarchy. Palaces stand shoulder-to-shoulder with tenements that look suspiciously like they're held together by sheer willpower and a generous application of plaster. Washing lines strung across narrow alleys create a charming, if somewhat claustrophobic, tapestry of laundry. And everywhere, everywhere, the Vesuvian presence looms, a silent giant hinting at a past both glorious and terrifying, and a future, well, that remains to be seen. One can't help but feel a certain affection for Naples, despite its eccentricities. It is, after all, a city that refuses to be tidy, that embraces its own peculiar brand of madness with a gusto that is both admirable and slightly alarming. A place where one suspects that if Vesuvius were to erupt tomorrow, the Neapolitans would simply shrug, fry up some more pizza fritta, and carry on as if nothing extraordinary had happened at all.
