Mormonism, more formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, emerged in the early 19th century with Joseph Smith as its founder. A pivotal moment in the faith's history is Smith's claim of receiving golden plates containing ancient scriptures, translated into the Book of Mormon, which complements and expands upon the Bible. This sacred text details the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas, their relationship with God, and the visit of Jesus Christ to the continent after his resurrection. A distinctive tenet of Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, suggesting that God continues to communicate with humanity through modern prophets and apostles, guiding the Church in contemporary times. This differs from many traditional Christian denominations that view the biblical canon as closed.

The Church’s organizational structure is hierarchical, led by a President considered a prophet, and supported by apostles and other leaders who oversee various geographical regions and congregations known as wards and stakes. The emphasis on family is central to Mormon doctrine, with the belief in eternal families sealed together through sacred temple ordinances. Temples, distinct from meetinghouses used for weekly worship, are reserved for specific ordinances, including baptisms for the dead and celestial marriages intended to bind families together for eternity. Missionary work is a prominent aspect of Mormon life, with young men and women often serving full-time missions, proselytizing and engaging in humanitarian efforts around the world. Historically, the Church experienced significant persecution, particularly due to the practice of polygamy in the 19th century, which was later discontinued. Despite past controversies, the Church has grown significantly and has a global presence. It emphasizes community involvement, self-reliance, and a strong commitment to moral values and ethical behavior, with a focus on service and contributing to the well-being of society. The Church has become a major player in philanthropic efforts and disaster relief programs, making significant contributions worldwide. The religion also upholds the Bible and promotes the belief that Jesus is the savior of all mankind.
