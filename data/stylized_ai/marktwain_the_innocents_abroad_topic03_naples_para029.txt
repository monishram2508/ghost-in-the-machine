Naples, ah, Naples! A city where the very stones seem to sweat under the weight of history and, if I may be frank, a distinct aroma of something that might be sewage, might be the finest marinara in Christendom, or, more likely, a robust blend of both. I've seen more dust in an hour there than I care to see in a decade, and a regiment of flies that could give the Austrian army a run for its money in sheer persistence. One steps gingerly, mind you, lest one finds oneself knee-deep in refuse, or perhaps some discarded regalia of a forgotten saint. Yet, dear reader, do not be fooled by this apparent chaos. For amidst the squalor and the clamor, there's a pulse, a feverish energy that thrums through the city like a caffeinated tarantella. Vesuvian passions simmer just beneath the surface, ready to boil over at the slightest provocation, be it a disputed parking space or a less-than-stellar rendition of "O Sole Mio."

The Neapolitan, bless his heart, is a study in contradictions. He'll swear by the Madonna with one breath and curse the tax collector with the next. He is a master of improvisation, a poet of the back alley, a con man with the charisma of a Medici prince. He lives life loud, lives it large, and lives it perpetually on the verge of some grand, operatic catastrophe, but never seems to mind the chaos that surrounds him. He believes, and rightly so I think, that life is too short to be anything but loud and full of gusto. And as for the food, good heavens! It’s enough to make a man forget his mother-in-law, perhaps even his own name. Pizza that makes you weep for joy, pasta that sings to your soul, and enough seafood to fill Noah’s Ark twice over. One could easily forgive Naples its dust, its smells, and its generally bewildering nature, simply for the privilege of partaking in its culinary delights. Though, I must confess, I packed my own soap. One can never be too careful, you know, when venturing into such a splendid, yet undoubtedly… vigorous, locale.
