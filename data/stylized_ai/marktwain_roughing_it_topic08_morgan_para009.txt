Now, I reckon I encountered a specimen once out in Nevada, named Morgan he was, though I misdoubt that was his given moniker. Seemed the sort who’d acquire a name the way a prospector acquires a claim - by a bit of bluster, a dab of luck, and maybe a questionable transaction or two. He was a fella built like a saguaro cactus, tall and lean, all angles and prickly disposition. His face, tanned like old saddle leather, was etched with more lines than a surveyor’s map, each one tellin' a tale of hard livin’ and harder drinkin’. Morgan claimed to be a silver miner, though I never saw him dirty his hands much. He had a way of being perpetually between jobs, which is to say he spent most his time leanin’ against the saloon bar, nursin’ a whiskey and lookin’ important. His stories, mind you, were another matter entirely. Why, he’d fought off bands of renegade Apaches, discovered a vein of gold so pure it blinded him for a week, and once outsmarted a card sharp so slick he could shuffle a deck with his toes. Believable? Well, about as believable as a politician’s promise. But entertainin’? Now there was a different kettle of fish altogether. He possessed a voice like gravel tumbling down a ravine, and he’d spin yarns with such conviction, you’d almost start believin’ him. Almost. I suspect Morgan was more skilled at fabrication than excavation, a master storyteller who preferred the gleam of tall tales to the gleam of real gold. A harmless enough fella, I suppose, unless you happened to be on the losing end of one of his “deals.” Then, you might find yourself wonderin' if that silver-tongued devil hadn’t just mined you for all you were worth. But as they say out West, a fool and his money are soon parted, and Morgan, bless his heart, was always happy to lend a hand in the separation.
