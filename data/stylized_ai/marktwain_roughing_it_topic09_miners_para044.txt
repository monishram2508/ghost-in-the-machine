Them miners, now there's a breed and a half! Why, you could pick one out in a crowd of preachers and debutantes at a hundred paces. The tan, cured like a well-worn saddle, the way they squint even in a dim saloon, and a certain looseness to their gait, like they're still compensating for uneven ground even when standing on level floorboards. And the stories! Lord, the stories they could tell. Half of them true, maybe a third, and the other two-thirds liberally embellished with enough tall tale to reach plumb to the moon. I once met a fella claimed to have found a nugget so big, he used it as a doorstop. Said it kept the draft out tolerably well, 'cept when the wind was blowing hard, then it kinda rattled against the frame. Course, I took that with a grain of salt, more like a whole shaker, but I listened all the same.

They were a superstitious lot too, them miners. One wouldn't set foot in a tunnel on a Tuesday, another carried a rabbit’s foot and a deck of marked cards for luck. The rabbit foot probably worked about as well as the cards, come to think of it. They had a strange reverence for the earth too. Even while they were carving holes in her belly, looking for her golden secrets, they spoke of her with a sort of grudging respect, like a cantankerous mule they depended on. They’d curse the veins when they played coy, but they’d also pat the rock face when they struck a good pocket. It was a fickle relationship, fortune and toil, and it aged them quick. They'd arrive in these boomtowns bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, then leave a few years later with stooped shoulders and empty pockets. But somehow, somewhere, I suspect they wouldn’t trade the experience, not for all the tea in China. It was a hard life, a dangerous life, but by thunder, it was their life, and they lived it with a gusto that’d make a parson blush.
