Them miners, now there's a breed apart, I tell you. You’d think burrowing in the bowels of the earth, chasing after some elusive shiny rock would make a man somber and quiet-like, but Lord, no. They’re louder than a brass band on payday and twice as likely to spin you a yarn so tall it'd make a redwood blush. Saw a fellow name o' Dusty Rhodes down in Virginia City – claimed he once struck a vein of silver so pure, it sang to him. Sang! Said it was a high-pitched opera singer, demanding a better ventilation system. Course, Dusty was known to partake in a bit of "medicinal" whiskey, so I took his serenade with a grain of salt, same as the salt they used to pack the dynamite.

Down in those holes, they're a community, closer than kin, bound by the danger and the darkness. One wrong swing of the pick, one loose timber, and you’re liable to be flatter than a pancake. Yet, they’d gamble on anything – whose candle would burn the longest, who could spit tobacco juice the furthest, even how many bats would fly out the main shaft at dusk. I swear, they'd bet on the color of the dust settling on their boots. And the food! Lord have mercy, it was always the same: beans, bacon, and biscuits harder than granite. A man could break a tooth trying to chew breakfast, then go risk his life drilling into solid rock. Figure that says something about priorities, don't you? They were a rough and tumble bunch, prone to brawls and boastful exaggerations, but when push came to shove, they'd share their last drop of water and their last stick of dynamite with a friend, no questions asked. They were searching for fortune, sure, but they also found something else down there in the dark: a camaraderie you couldn’t buy with all the gold in California.
