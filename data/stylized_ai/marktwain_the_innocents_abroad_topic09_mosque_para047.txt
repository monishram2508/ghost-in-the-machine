Now, concerning this edifice they call a mosque, a peculiar place it is, and no mistake. I ventured inside one in Constantinople, a riot of domes and minarets that would make a bishop blush, and found myself quite confounded. You see, I’m accustomed to a church where a fellow can at least prop himself up against a pew and catch forty winks during the sermon, but this mosque was all open space, save for some magnificent rugs that felt scandalously luxurious underfoot. A fella couldn't even properly slump!

There were gentlemen prostrating themselves with alarming enthusiasm, knocking their foreheads against the floor with such conviction I feared for their craniums. One couldn't help but admire the dedication, even if I found myself wondering if they'd forgotten their spectacles on the prayer rug. The place was teeming with hushed voices reciting things in a language I couldn't rightly fathom, but which sounded agreeable enough, like a celestial auctioneer pitching the virtues of paradise. 

And the light! Good heavens, the light! Filtering through stained glass windows in a kaleidoscope of colours, making me feel like I'd stepped inside a giant's kaleidoscope. It was all quite dazzling and a little bit disorienting, mind you. I felt a strong urge to put on my shades and look for the nearest bar, but that likely wouldn't be considered proper etiquette.

Of course, the minaret stands out like a sore thumb, a tall thin tower that pierces the sky, from which a fellow hollers things five times a day. It's enough to wake the dead, or at least annoy the tourists, if I'm being perfectly honest. They call it the "call to prayer." Well, I suppose anything that rouses you from a nap is certainly a "call" to something, even if it's just a call to grumbling. But I reckon that's the nature of these religious things - always with the grand pronouncements and the dramatic gestures. You'll be excused if I find the whole thing a tad theatrical, wouldn't you?
