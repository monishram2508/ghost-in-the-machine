So, I found myself out in the Utah territory, amongst the Latter-day Saints, or Mormons as the gentiles like to call 'em. A curious bunch, to be sure. Folks said they had secrets tighter than a miser's purse strings, and beliefs wilder than a mustang in a hailstorm. This Brigham Young, now he was the head honcho, a fellow with more wives than a centipede has legs, or so the gossip went. Some said he was a prophet, others a shrewd businessman with a holy veneer. Take your pick, I reckon, the truth probably nestled somewhere betwixt the two, like a prairie dog in its burrow. 

They built their city, Salt Lake, right smack dab in the middle of the desert, and darned if it wasn't blooming like a rose in June. Irrigation ditches spider-webbed everywhere, coaxing life from that stubborn earth. They worked like beavers, industrious as ants, and their communities hummed with a sort of quiet, pious energy. Seemed like everyone had a job, and everyone toed the line. Didn't see much in the way of saloons or gambling dens, not like back in Nevada. 

Now, I ain't one to judge a man's faith. If a fellow wants to believe in golden plates and translated scriptures, that's his business. But I will say, the whole business of polygamy struck me as peculiar. Trying to juggle that many wives? Why, a man'd need a ledger book just to keep track of anniversaries and birthdays! And the whispers! Lord have mercy, the whispers about who favored who, and the petty squabbles. It was a regular soap opera, only with more sermons and less bathing. Still, they seemed content enough, these Mormons. Maybe happiness is just a matter of perspective, like whether you prefer your whiskey neat or cut with water from a desert spring. They'd carved out a home in a place most folks wouldn't give a second glance and they seemed hell bent on staying put. Call it faith, call it stubbornness, call it what you will, but there was something undeniably impressive about it all.
