Gibraltar, bless my soul, a veritable wart on the nether regions of Spain, yet held with such tenacity by John Bull that one suspects it must be paved with particularly fine guinea gold. A curious spectacle it is, this rock; rising abruptly from the sea like a petrified whale attempting a somersault. One can't help but feel a touch of pity for the Spaniard who, after centuries of wistful gazes, still finds himself on the outside looking in, much like a poor relation at a lavish wedding.

They say Hercules himself once separated Africa from Europe right at this very spot, creating the Straits. A mighty feat, indeed, though I suspect a generous application of dynamite might have achieved a similar result with considerably less divine intervention. The place is a veritable rabbit warren of tunnels, carved and burrowed over centuries by soldiers with seemingly nothing better to do than to outdo the local rodents. One half expects to stumble upon a secret passage leading straight to the cellars of Buckingham Palace, stocked with nothing but the finest brandy and a squadron of Queen Victoria's most prized corgis.

And the monkeys, ah, the Barbary apes! A band of mischievous brigands in furry coats, utterly devoid of respect for human dignity or carefully laid plans. They'll relieve you of your hat, your spectacles, your luncheon, and quite possibly your very soul, all with an impish grin that suggests they consider the whole affair a grand jest. The superstitious claim that as long as the apes remain, Gibraltar will remain British. A rather tenuous hold on empire, wouldn't you say? Relying on the whims of a troop of kleptomaniacal primates? Still, I suppose it's as good a reason as any to keep feeding them peanuts and ensuring they remain comfortably ensconced in their rocky domain, a living, breathing (and exceedingly hairy) symbol of British pluck and Spanish chagrin. A curious place, Gibraltar. A place where history, geology, and a troop of ill-mannered monkeys converge to create a spectacle both baffling and, dare I say it, rather entertaining.
