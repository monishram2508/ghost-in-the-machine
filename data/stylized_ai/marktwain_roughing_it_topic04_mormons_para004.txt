Well, I reckon I spent a spell in Salt Lake City, that Zion of the Latter-day Saints, and found the Mormons a curious bunch, alright. First off, you'll hear tell of their prophet, Joseph Smith, finding golden plates nigh on to two thousand years old, buried by an angel, mind you. Plates writ in reformed Egyptian, which seems a mighty inconvenient choice for the Almighty if you ask me, but who am I to judge celestial bureaucracy? Smith translated ‘em into the Book of Mormon, a chronicle of ancient Israelites wandering about the Americas. Now, I've heard some blame the Book for its prose, claiming it reads like the King James Bible run through a flour mill. But I say, give the man credit. He conjured a whole new history for a continent, complete with battles, prophets, and enough "yea, verlys" to choke a horse.

Then there’s the polygamy business. Used to be a right proper scandal, what with a man having ten, twenty wives. Seemed a mite greedy, even for the Wild West. Nowadays, they've mostly cleaned up their act, leastways officially. Folks whisper about splinter groups in the hills still practicing the old ways, but I didn't venture far enough into the wilderness to verify such rumors. But I did notice, even among the modern Saints, a peculiar respect for women. Not the fluttering, delicate kind, mind you, but a sturdy, capable sort of respect, born perhaps from running a household large enough to populate a small town. And say what you will about their theology, those Mormons knew how to irrigate a desert. They transformed a barren wasteland into a blooming oasis, and that, friend, is a miracle any man can see, reformed Egyptian or no. Made me wonder if all this theological hocus-pocus wasn’t just a clever way to get folks organized and working together, like a grand, divinely-inspired co-op. A fella could get rich selling shovels out there, I tell you what.
