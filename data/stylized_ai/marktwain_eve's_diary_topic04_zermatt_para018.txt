Zermatt, you say? A place where the mountains stick up like the quills of a frightened porcupine, and the air is so rarefied it tickles your nose like a feather duster wielded by an enthusiastic angel. One is obliged to arrive by train, a contraption that chugs and puffs its way up the valley like a rheumatic dragon, for the locals, in their peculiar wisdom, have banned the infernal combustion engine from their precious haven. Imagine! A village spared the indignity of being choked by the fumes of progress – it’s enough to make a modern man weep with relief, or at least consider purchasing a velocipede. The very absence of automobiles lends Zermatt a certain quaintness, a feeling of having stumbled back into a Currier & Ives print, albeit one populated by tourists sporting designer skiwear and an uncanny ability to navigate cobblestone streets in expensive hiking boots. 

And the Matterhorn! Why, it dominates the landscape like a dowager aunt at a summer picnic, utterly impossible to ignore. It looms over everything, a craggy sentinel of rock and ice, daring you to try and climb it, knowing full well you probably haven’t the constitution (or the climbing gear) to manage more than a spirited attempt at snapping a photograph from a safe distance. One is informed that scores of hardy souls attempt its ascent each year, some succeeding, some finding themselves more intimately acquainted with the mountain's unforgiving embrace. It all seems rather a lot of bother, if you ask me, when one could be enjoying a perfectly respectable fondue in one of the village's countless restaurants, contemplating the majesty of it all with a belly full of cheese and a glass of something that sparkles with alarming enthusiasm. Yes, Zermatt is a place where the sublime and the ridiculous meet, a testament to the human impulse to seek both adventure and a good, comfortable chair.
