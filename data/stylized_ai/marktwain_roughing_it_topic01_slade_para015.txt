Now, Slade, that fellow was a caution, a regular fire-eater if ever there was one this side of the Mississippi. I met him first out in Julesburg, back when that place was more whiskey and gunfire than houses and hymns. Slade was the division agent for the Overland Stage Company, and lord, did he run that line with an iron fist – and occasionally, a gun. Some folks said he was a downright murderer, and maybe they weren’t lying. I heard tales that would curdle your blood, about men he'd strung up for stealing a measly chicken, or riddling a fellow with holes just for looking at him cross-eyed. But then again, I also heard stories about him helping widows and orphans, giving them a fair shake when everyone else was busy taking advantage. Human nature's a funny thing, ain't it? Mixes up the saint and the sinner in the same pot.

One time, I saw him dealing with a stagecoach robbery. Bandits had held up one of his rigs, and Slade, bless his heart, was hotter than a two-dollar pistol. He tracked those varmints down, single-handedly, mind you, and brought 'em back to Julesburg tied to the back of his horse. Now, I ain't gonna say what happened next, but let's just say they weren't bothering nobody ever again. But the funny thing was, the next day, Slade was back to being all charm and smiles, like he hadn't just dealt out frontier justice the night before. He was a character, Slade was, all right. A walking contradiction, a blend of ruthlessness and unexpected kindness. You couldn't help but be fascinated by him, even if you were scared stiff at the same time. He was a wild card, a force of nature, a living, breathing testament to the untamed spirit of the West. And I reckon, in those days, that was just about the highest compliment you could pay a man.
