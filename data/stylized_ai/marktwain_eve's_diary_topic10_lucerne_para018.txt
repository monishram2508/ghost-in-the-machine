Lucerne, now there's a place with pretensions, I tell you. A regular picture postcard come to life, all shimmering lake and snow-capped Alps poking up in the background like theatrical scenery. You half expect a stage manager to yell "Curtain!" and whisk it all away. The tourists, bless their cotton socks, eat it up, they do. They clatter around in those horse-drawn carriages, looking for all the world like royalty who forgot to pack their common sense. And the shops! Lord have mercy, the shops! Cuckoo clocks by the score, Swiss Army knives fit to arm a small battalion, and enough chocolate to give a diabetic a reason to renounce their oath. Why, a fella could bankrupt himself twice over just trying to bring home "authentic" souvenirs. I saw one poor chap, red as a beet and sweating like a horse, attempting to haggle over the price of a miniature alphorn. The shopkeeper, a fella with a face like a cheese grater and eyes that could pierce steel, didn't budge an inch. Serves him right, I thought. Attempting to apply American gumption in Switzerland is like trying to argue with a glacier – you're just wasting your breath.

But truth be told, even I, a hardened cynic with a heart of gravel and a tongue of barbed wire, couldn't help but find a certain charm in the place. The air, so crisp and clean it practically bites you on the cheek, the water so clear you can see the bottom and count every single cobblestone, and the sheer, audacious beauty of the mountains... well, it's enough to make a man consider taking up yodeling. Almost. I mean, I'd never admit it aloud, mind you, but there's a certain something about Lucerne that sticks with you. Like a catchy tune you can't quite shake, or maybe a stubborn stain on your best trousers. A scenic stain, mind you. One you wouldn't particularly mind keeping around. Just don't tell anyone I said so. They'd never let me live it down. Especially after all the grand declarations I made about it being nothing more than a gaudy tourist trap. A gaudy tourist trap with a surprisingly fetching view, if you catch my drift. Now, where's that cuckoo clock merchant? I might just need another souvenir… for purely scientific observation, of course.
