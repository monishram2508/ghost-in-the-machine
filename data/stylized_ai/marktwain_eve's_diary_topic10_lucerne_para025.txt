Now, Lucerne, bless her heart, is a town that tries, she truly does. Sets itself up on that lake, all sparkling and simpering, trying to fool you into believing she's some grand European dame. Which, mind you, she ain't. No, sir. She's got that wooden bridge, the Chapel Bridge, with its painted pictures flaking off worse than old paint on a steamboat, and they tell you it's history. History! I reckon my Aunt Petunia's collection of doilies has more history, and certainly less of that mildew smell. Then there's that lion carved into the rock, the Dying Lion, they call it. A mournful critter, carved to commemorate some Swiss Guards who got themselves killed in the French Revolution. Now, I always say, if you're going to hire yourself out as a guard, at least make sure the folks paying you are on the winning side. Otherwise, you're just a lion carved into a rock, and a lesson to all the young'uns about bad career choices. 

The mountains surrounding the town, they're pretty enough, I'll grant you that. But mountains are mountains, ain't they? Like freckles on a milkmaid; after you've seen a few, you've seen 'em all. And the shops? Oh, the shops! Full of cuckoo clocks and Swiss Army knives. I swear, if I see one more cuckoo pop out of a clock every fifteen minutes, I’m liable to shoot it. The knives, they're handy, I suppose. But who needs twelve different sizes of screwdrivers and a tiny saw that could barely cut butter? I suspect half of 'em are used to open those infernal cheese and chocolate packages that they’re trying to sell you on every corner. No, Lucerne's a pleasant enough place to spend an afternoon, but don't go expecting it to be more than she is. She's a pretty postcard, not a whole damn novel. Just remember to watch out for those pesky pigeons near the lake; they're bolder than a preacher asking for donations, and just as likely to take the bread right out of your hand.
