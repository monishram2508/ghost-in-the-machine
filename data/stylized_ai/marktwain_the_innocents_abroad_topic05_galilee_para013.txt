Galilee, bless its heart, is a district that has seen better days, I reckon, or at least, days more vigorously celebrated in song and story. Why, they make it sound like a blooming paradise in them Sunday school tales, milk and honey practically dripping off the rocks. Now, I ain’t saying there ain’t no beauty to be found there, mind you. The Sea of Galilee itself, that's a fine puddle of water, sparkling blue under a decent sun, and big enough for a fella to drown his sorrows in if he’s of a mind to, though I’d advise against it, seeing as how water breeds more sorrow than it cures, usually. The hills round about are…well, they’re hills. Not particularly impressive hills, mind you, more like the foothills that got tired halfway to becoming a proper mountain. Covered in olive trees, mostly, which look picturesque enough from a distance, but up close they got the knobby, twisted look of old men arguing about taxes.

And the villages! Oh, the villages of Galilee. Nazareth, Capernaum, places where history supposedly happened, now looking as though history took a nap there and forgot to wake up. Dusty streets, stray dogs, and vendors selling trinkets made in Taiwan – a far cry, I assure you, from the holy atmosphere one might expect. I saw one fellow trying to convince a pilgrim that a plastic glow-in-the-dark crucifix was an authentic relic blessed by… well, someone important, I’m sure. Gave me a chuckle, it did. They say miracles happened here, back in the day. These days, the real miracle would be finding a decent cup of coffee. Though I did see a cat curled up in the window of a bakery, looking suspiciously well-fed, leading me to believe some miracles might still be happening, just the small, feline kind. All in all, Galilee is a place you ought to see, if only to understand that reality rarely measures up to the picture postcard. Just pack a sense of humor, a good pair of shoes, and maybe a pinch of salt to take everything with. You’ll need it.
