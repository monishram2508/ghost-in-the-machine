Damascus, bless its ancient heart, is a city that'll test your patience and reward it in equal measure, much like trying to train a particularly stubborn mule. You see, it’s old, terribly old, boasting more history than a professor has dusty books. Why, they claim it's the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, which I reckon is a polite way of saying it's been too lazy to move since folks first figured out how to build a proper wall. And walls there are, plenty of 'em, layered upon layered like a particularly elaborate onion, each layer whispering tales of conquests and caliphs, of sieges and silk roads. The streets, now, they're another matter entirely. They're narrow and winding, as if designed by a committee of cats with a penchant for playing hide-and-seek. You’ll swear you're lost every five minutes, but fear not, for losing yourself in Damascus is half the fun, assuming you enjoy breathing air thick enough to spread on toast.

And the bazaars! Ah, the bazaars of Damascus are a spectacle, a kaleidoscope of colors and scents that’ll assault your senses with the force of a runaway camel. Merchants hawk their wares with voices that could shatter glass, promising you the finest carpets, the shiniest brass, and the most authentic "ancient" artifacts – most of which, I suspect, were crafted last Tuesday in a back alley. But who am I to judge? One buys what one can afford, and if a slightly-too-new "Roman" coin makes a fella happy, then let him have his joy. The people, though, are the real treasure of Damascus. They're weathered and wise, with eyes that have seen more than most books could ever hold. They're quick with a smile, quick with a story, and quicker still with a cup of tea that’s strong enough to wake the dead. You’ll likely be invited into a stranger’s home for a meal before you can even pronounce "Shukran," and you’ll leave feeling as if you've known them all your life. It's that kind of place, Damascus; messy, maddening, magnificent. Just be sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring a good supply of handkerchiefs, both for the dust and the sheer, unadulterated charm that’s bound to leave you a bit weepy.
