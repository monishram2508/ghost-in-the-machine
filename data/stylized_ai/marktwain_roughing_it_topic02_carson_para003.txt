Now, Carson City, you see, was a town built on the back of a dream, or perhaps a delusion, depending on who you asked. They called it the capital of Nevada, though a pack of stray dogs arguing over a discarded ham bone seemed to conduct more official business, and with more decorum too. It was a dusty little pocket of humanity clinging to the side of the mountains like a tick on a longhorn, hoping some stray piece of silver might brush off and land in their lap. Lord, the streets! They weren't paved, mind you, but rather…suggested. More like faint dirt trails hinting at a future road, a future which, judging by the state of things, seemed perpetually delayed. The buildings, bless their cotton socks, were a hodgepodge of aspirations, hastily thrown together after someone yelled “strike!” from a nearby mine. There were grand, two-story affairs that looked like they’d been ripped straight from a Philadelphia street corner and plunked down in the middle of the desert, right next to shacks made from old corrugated iron and the fervent hopes of a man who swore he knew how to "witch" water.

The air hung thick with dust and the scent of sagebrush, occasionally punctuated by the aroma of whatever questionable stew was bubbling in the local boarding house. You'd see men lounging on porches, chewing tobacco and whittling sticks, their eyes glazed over with the sun and the slow, quiet despair of watching fortunes being made and lost all around them, without ever getting a piece. Every other establishment was a saloon or some other den of iniquity, promising escape from the relentless reality of the Great Basin. Gambling tables gleamed under the harsh glare of gas lamps, inviting the weary traveler to shed his remaining fortune on a roll of the dice. Carson City was a place where dreams went to either flourish wildly or die a quick, dusty death. And you could never quite tell which one it would be. A bit like playing poker with the devil, really.
