Now, concerning these Bedouins, these children of the desert, vagabonds with sunburned faces and a devil-may-care glint in their eye – well, they are a breed apart, I tell you. You see, I’ve encountered a few in my travels, lurking near the edges of the Empty Quarter like mirages promising water. And water, mind you, is as precious as a saint’s tear in those parts, which is likely why they’re so stingy with it. One fellow, draped in more cloth than a draper’s shop window, offered me a sip from his goat-skin bag that smelled suspiciously of, well, goat. I politely declined, claiming a sudden and intense affliction of the palate. He eyed me with suspicion, I swear he did, like I'd just insulted his mother’s camel.

They possess a certain… let’s call it "elasticity" with the truth when it comes to haggling for camels or dates. You might think you’re getting a bargain, only to discover later that the camel has a limp you didn't notice, or the dates are older than Methuselah. But you can’t truly fault them; survival in that baked landscape is a game of wits, and theirs are sharper than a Bedouin’s scimitar. They move with a grace, these Bedouins, like shadows cast by the moon, silent and knowing. They can read the desert like you or I read a newspaper – although I suspect they’d find a newspaper rather confusing, what with all the writing and none of the sand. Their tents, spun from goat hair, are their palaces, and the endless expanse of the desert their kingdom. A kingdom, mind you, perpetually short on water and long on sand. But they wouldn't trade it for a king's ransom, and I suppose, in a way, that makes them richer than any king I've ever met.
