Chamonix, you see, is a place of contradictions, much like a woman trying to decide what to wear to a ball. The mountains, bless their rocky souls, are so outrageously tall they appear to have been erected by a committee of particularly ambitious giants, each trying to outdo the last with a more ludicrous peak. Mont Blanc, that grand old dame herself, she towers over the entire valley, a queen draped in a perpetual ermine cloak of snow. One can scarcely breathe without bumping into a postcard-perfect view, and frankly, after a while, the sheer volume of beauty becomes quite tiresome. Like being forced to eat an entire box of bonbons - delectable, yes, but eventually one longs for a plain, unadorned biscuit.

Now, the town itself…ah, Chamonix! A jumble of chalets seemingly dropped from the heavens by a careless angel, interspersed with shops selling more varieties of skiing paraphernalia than one could shake a ski pole at. The air vibrates with the clamor of languages, a linguistic circus that would leave even the most seasoned polyglot scratching their heads in befuddlement. One hears snippets of German, Italian, and that peculiar tongue the English seem so fond of, all battling for dominance in a cacophony of tourism. And the tourists, bless their hearts, they come from all corners of the globe, each determined to conquer the mountain, or at least purchase a snow globe depicting it. They shuffle about in their fashionable (and often impractical) winter gear, radiating an air of determined leisure, as if climbing a mountain were merely a slightly more strenuous form of afternoon tea. The whole affair is utterly delightful, preposterous, and altogether unforgettable, rather like a perfectly-orchestrated farce performed on a stage constructed of rock and ice. One leaves Chamonix both exhausted and invigorated, filled with wonder and a slight craving for something utterly ordinary, like a good cup of tea without the backdrop of a majestic glacier.
