Now, this glacier, it’s a spectacle, I tell you, a right ponderous, slow-moving river of ice, as if the Almighty Himself had poured out a whole winter's worth of frozen lemonade and just let it set there for a millennium or two. Seems to me, if one were to sit and observe it for a decade or so – which, frankly, is precisely what some blokes with more time than sense seem inclined to do – one might just perceive it inching along, grinding and groaning like an old spinster forced to waltz with a boisterous nephew. It carries along with it, this glacial monstrosity, a collection of rocks and debris that would make a rubbish heap blush. Boulders the size of houses, pebbles the size of plums, and mud that looks as if it’s been brewed in the depths of the earth just for the purpose of making boots heavier. You’d think the glacier would have the decency to sort things out a bit, keep the big uns with the big uns, but no, it mixes them all together, a chaotic jumble of geological odds and ends. And the color of it all! A hazy, murky blue, not like the sky on a good day, nor the sapphire in a king’s ring, but more like the feeling you get when you realize you've misplaced your spectacles right before a particularly engaging magic show. One might expect such a grand, imposing thing to have a certain solemn dignity about it, but you’d be sorely mistaken. It creaks and cracks and moans like a toothache, and every now and then, a chunk will break off with a thunderous roar, sending a geyser of icy water skyward like a mischievous cherub having a bit of fun. Then the whole thing settles again, sighs, and continues its imperceptible journey towards the sea, likely dreaming of the day when it can finally melt into a puddle and be rid of all that pesky debris. Truly, it's a marvel of nature, assuming one considers a slow, noisy, and slightly disorganized marvel to be worthy of the title.
