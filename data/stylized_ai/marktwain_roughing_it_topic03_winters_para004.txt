Winter, now there’s a spectacle, a regular theatrical production put on by Mother Nature, only she forgets to send you a playbill, so you never quite know if you’re in for a tragedy or a comedy. Back East, they call it “snow,” and claim it’s romantic, like a courting couple waltzing under a lamplit street. Out West, we call it something less polite, something usually involving adjectives like “blasted,” and nouns best left unprinted. It drifts down, you see, not like those dainty eastern flakes, but like someone’s emptied a whole goose down comforter from the sky, feathers and all. And the wind, bless its mischievous heart, delights in piling it up in drifts that’ll swallow your whole cabin if you aren’t careful.

Then there’s the cold, a creeping, bone-deep chill that’ll sneak into your whiskers and nip at your nose when you least expect it. You can pile on the buffalo hides till you look like a walking haystack, but that old devil still finds a way in. Saw a fellow once, tried to outsmart it by sleeping in a hollowed-out haystack, only to wake up the next morning looking like a snowman himself, frozen solid. Nature’s got a sense of humor, that’s for certain, even if it’s a bit on the cruel side. Course, there’s beauty to it all, too, I suppose. The way the snow sparkles under the moon, the sharp, clean air that smells like a million pine needles, the utter stillness when the wind finally lays down its arms. But that beauty comes with a price, a hefty one at that. It's a time for sitting by the fire, telling tall tales, and waiting for the blessed thaw, all the while knowing that old man Winter’s just biding his time, sharpening his icy knives for another go-round. And you best be ready, or you’ll find yourself another frozen monument to his chilly tyranny.
