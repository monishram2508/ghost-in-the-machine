 Pard? Lordy, now there's a subject ripe for a bit of whittling. Pard, as they call it out in these here territories, short for “partner,” though more often than not it's a synonym for "sap" or "mark." You latch onto a pard, especially when gold fever's got its grubby hooks in ya, thinkin' two heads are better than one when it comes to sniffing out the glittery stuff. That's the theory, anyway. Reality, as usual, is a skunk in a Sunday social.

Most pards you encounter ain't worth the powder to blow 'em to kingdom come. Either they’re slower than molasses in January, squinting at the ground like they’re lookin’ for a lost button when a whole mountain of ore's practically winking at 'em, or they’re so all-fired smart they can’t see past their own noses. You get a feller convinced he's a geological genius, tellin' you about anticlines and synclines and strata that'll make your ears ache, but when it comes down to actually hittin' paydirt, he's about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. And don't even get me started on the ones who can "sense" gold. They close their eyes, swivel their heads, and declare with the certainty of a preacher that the mother lode is precisely three paces north-north-east, only to dig up a badger hole and a whole lotta disappointment. 

Of course, the real trouble starts when one of you actually finds somethin' worth havin'. Then, that brotherly affection you were buildin' suddenly turns sourer than a week-old lemon. Suspicions start creepin' in like sidewinders. Suddenly, every cough, every glance, every trip to the creek is a plot to swindle you outta your rightful share. You start measurin' your portion of the diggings with the precision of a pawnbroker, and dreamin' up ways to outsmart your pard before he outsmarts you. And that, I reckon, is the true gold rush: not the search for riches underground, but the scramble to keep 'em from disappearin' into your pard's greedy pockets. It's enough to make a man long for the solitary life of a prospectin' jackrabbit, even if it means eatin' beans and dust for the rest of his days.
