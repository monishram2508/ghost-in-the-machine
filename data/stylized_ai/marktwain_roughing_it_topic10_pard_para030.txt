Well, I reckon a pard, which some fellers call a leopard, is a cat. A mighty big cat, mind you, not your everyday purrer. It's got spots all over it, like a polka-dotted nightmare. You see one of those sneaking through the long grass, and you know you're not in Kansas anymore, Toto. I encountered one once, out by the crick, bigger than my old hound dog, Buster. Had those yellow eyes that seemed to bore right through you, like a preacher sizing up your Sunday contribution. I swear, the crick water just up and froze solid when that fella took a drink. 

Now, I ain't ashamed to admit I took to my heels faster than a greased pig at a county fair. Some folks might call that cowardice, but I call it self-preservation, plain and simple. You ain't gonna argue with a pard, not unless you're plumb loco. They got claws like grappling hooks and teeth that could make mincemeat out of a buffalo, let alone yours truly. I remember reading about a feller who tried to domesticate one, thought he could make a house pet out of it. Said it was "misunderstood" and just needed "love." Well, last I heard, that feller was misunderstood alright, misunderstood what a pard thinks about belly rubs. Ended up needing a whole lot of love from a doctor, sewing him back together like a patchwork quilt. 

They say a pard is cunning too, smarter than your average politician. They stalk their prey with a patience that'd make a saint jealous, and when they strike, it's faster than lightning. I heard tell of a pard down in Africa who used to lay in wait on a tree branch, then drop down on unsuspecting antelopes like a hairy, spotted missile. Served 'em right, probably. Probably voting for the wrong party, anyway. Me? I prefer to keep my distance from pards. I admire their beauty, their strength, their raw, untamed nature. Just admire it from a safe distance, preferably with a good stout tree between us and a loaded rifle handy, just in case admiration ain't quite enough.
