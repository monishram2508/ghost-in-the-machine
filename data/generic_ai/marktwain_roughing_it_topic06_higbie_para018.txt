Higbie, though perhaps not a household name, occupies a significant, if niche, space in American labor history and the evolution of the working class. More specifically, his scholarly contributions have illuminated the experiences of white, male workers during a crucial period of industrial and social transformation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work challenged conventional narratives that often overlooked the nuances of identity formation within this demographic, arguing that white working-class men were not simply passive recipients of economic forces, but actively constructed their understanding of themselves in relation to race, class, and gender. Higbie's research often delved into the social spaces where these identities were forged, examining the role of fraternal organizations, labor unions, and leisure activities in shaping a collective sense of self. By meticulously analyzing sources like union meeting minutes, newspapers, and personal correspondence, he painted a rich and complex portrait of a segment of the population often stereotyped as monolithic. He explored how these workers navigated the tensions between solidarity and exclusion, embracing a sense of shared economic interest while simultaneously upholding racial and gender hierarchies. This dualism, according to Higbie, was not merely a contradiction but a fundamental aspect of the white working-class experience during this era.

Furthermore, Higbie's scholarship often wrestled with the evolving definition of "manhood" in an industrializing society. He examined how the ideal of the independent craftsman, once the cornerstone of masculine identity, was challenged by the rise of factory work and wage labor. White working-class men sought to redefine their masculinity in the face of this economic upheaval, often turning to notions of physical strength, stoicism, and breadwinning ability to maintain a sense of control and self-worth. Higbie illustrated how these constructions of masculinity were not only shaped by economic factors but also deeply intertwined with racial anxieties. The perceived threat of African American workers, particularly during periods of labor unrest, served to reinforce a sense of white male privilege and solidify racial boundaries within the working class. By shedding light on these complex dynamics, Higbie’s work offers a critical perspective on the historical construction of race, class, and gender in the United States, prompting a deeper understanding of the origins of contemporary social inequalities and the enduring legacies of industrial capitalism.
