Now, about this mosque business. I reckon I’ve seen a fair share of them edifices, sprangled across the globe like forgotten baubles. You'll find one in the heart of Constantinople, standin' proud and defiant, claimin' real estate amongst the squalor and splendor like a seasoned gambler with a full house. Then there’s the kind you stumble upon in some dust-bitten village, all adobe and humility, whisperin' prayers to the heavens like a shy child.

The curious thing about 'em is, they all got this one thing in common: they're full of folks doin' that prayin' business. Head down, rear end up, mutterin' away like they're hagglin' for a particularly stubborn donkey. Some of 'em are downright theatrical about it, wailin' and moanin' fit to wake the dead, while others seem to be conductin' a silent negotiation with the Almighty, business-like and efficient. Ain't a soul can rightly say what they’re bargainin’ for, though, is it salvation, forgiveness or maybe just a good crop next harvest.

I’ve noticed, too, that these mosques are right particular about cleanliness. You gotta take off your boots before you go sashayin' around inside. Seems fair enough, I suppose. Wouldn't want to track mud and such all over the place while these fellas are tryin' to strike a deal with the divine. Always struck me as a curious thing though, this devotion to cleanliness coupled with a rampant acceptance of earthly injustices just outside the blessed walls. But who am I to say? I'm just a simple observer, a collector of human oddities, taking notes on the grand, ongoing comedy that is life. And these mosques, with their minarets prickling the sky and their earnest congregations, well, they're just another act in that never-ending show.
