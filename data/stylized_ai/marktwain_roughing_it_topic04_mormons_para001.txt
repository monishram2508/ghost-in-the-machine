Well, I’ll be hornswoggled if that Salt Lake City ain't somethin' to see, and the Mormons? Lord love ‘em, a peculiar bunch they are, alright. Drove in from the East, dusty as a tumbleweed and hungry as a coyote, and first thing I see is this temple, a contraption of white stone reachin’ for the heavens like it's tryin’ to shake hands with the Almighty. Now, I ain’t one to judge a man’s religion – live and let live, I always say, even if “livin’” involves believin’ a fella named Joseph Smith found golden plates in the ground and translated ‘em with some spectacles he conveniently had on hand. Seems a mighty specific pair of spectacles, if you ask me.

Anyhow, these Mormons, they're industrious, can't deny that. Cleaned up this desert something fierce, turned it into a garden practically, and all those wives runnin’ around, well, the man’s got to be organized to keep track of ‘em all. Course, some folks whisper about the whole polygamy business, sayin’ it ain't quite cricket. But I reckon if a fella can handle that much domestic tranquility (or maybe it's a whole lot of domestic *something* else), more power to him. They’re sociable enough, always willin' to lend a hand, even if they are lookin' at you a little sideways, tryin' to figure out if you’re a candidate for baptism or just another gent passin' through on his way to strike it rich. They got a certain earnestness about 'em, a kind of quiet certainty that they’re on the right track, which is more than I can say for most of the gold-crazed varmints I’ve run across in these parts. Still, them golden plates, I tell you… them golden plates stick in the craw a bit. But hey, who am I to argue with a man and his spectacles and a whole lotta wives and a desert full of vegetables? Just a humble traveler, passin’ through, observin’ the show, and tryin’ not to get too tangled up in the peculiar goings-on of the West.
