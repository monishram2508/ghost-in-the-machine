Brigham, now there’s a name that could curdle milk faster than a summer thunderstorm. Brigham Young, the Moses of the Mormons, as some folks generously (or perhaps nervously) dubbed him. A regular-sized, ruddy-faced man he was, not particularly striking in appearance unless you counted that unwavering, gimlet eye of his – a look that could bore a hole straight through a granite mountain. He was the sort of fella who seemed to know exactly where he was going, even if that destination involved hauling half a state's population across the desert on the promise of salvation and salt water. I reckon he knew how to spin a yarn, too. He had to, to convince all those souls that barren Utah was the Promised Land, better than California's shiny gold nuggets.

He built that Salt Lake City, you know, out of dust and dreams and a good deal of hard labor from folks who believed every word he uttered. A testament to faith, some might call it; a testament to a man's considerable persuasive talents, I’d wager. He certainly had a knack for keeping folks in line, too, what with all those wives under his roof. They say he had so many children that if he saw one he didn't recognize, he'd politely ask their name, just to be sure. Imagine the birthday parties! The Christmas shopping! Why, it'd be a logistical nightmare to rival building the transcontinental railroad. 

And the man was a shrewd businessman, no doubt about it. Controlled everything, from the flour mills to the saloons (though I suspect he kept a closer eye on the former than the latter, for appearances' sake). Some whispered that he hoarded wealth while urging his followers to live modestly, but you know how rumors go. Always a grain of truth wrapped in a mountain of exaggeration. Either way, Brigham, he left his mark on this world, whether you admired him, feared him, or simply scratched your head in bewildered fascination. A true pioneer, a religious leader, and a man who understood the art of controlling a crowd and maybe a few dozen wives simultaneously. Now, if that ain't a story worth spinning, I don't know what is.
