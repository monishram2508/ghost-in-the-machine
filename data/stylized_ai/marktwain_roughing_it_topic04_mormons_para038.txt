Well, I reckon I've seen Mormons thick as fleas on a mangy dog out in the Utah Territory. Salt Lake City, that's their stomping ground, and a curious place it is, too. Brigham Young, the late lamented leader, he had wives enough to populate a small town, and offspring aplenty, all industrious as beavers, I'll grant them that. They built up that desert into somethin' respectable, irrigatin' the land and makin' it bloom like a rose garden. Course, the Eastern folks, they get their knickers in a twist about the plural marriage business. Say it ain't proper, ain't Christian-like. But out here in the West, things are often done a tad different, and a man lookin' to expand his land holdings might find a large family a right practical asset.

They got this Book of Mormon, you see, said to be written on gold plates by a fella named Mormon, and Joseph Smith, the founder of the whole shebang, he translated it with the help of some peculiar spectacles, so the story goes. Says the Native Americans are descended from the Israelites. I ain’t gonna lie, that sounds like a tall tale even to a seasoned fibber like myself.

But these Mormons, they hold to it tight. They got missionaries scattering like tumbleweeds across the globe, tryin' to convert folks to their way of thinking. They're teetotalers, mostly, and industrious workers, and by golly, they're clean, inside and out, or so they say, and I'm certainly not in the business of judging a man's inner workings, especially if he ain't never offered me a drink. They strike me as a peculiar bunch, earnest as all get-out, and maybe a bit too trusting for their own good. But out here on the frontier, a man's got to stick to his kind. And the Mormons, well, they certainly stick to each other, good, bad, or indifferent.
