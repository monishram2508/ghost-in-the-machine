Now, a sepulchre, as anyone with a lick of sense knows, ain't just your common, garden-variety grave. No, sir. A grave's where you toss poor Aunt Millie after she finally succumbed to that stubborn case of the vapors, marked by a simple headstone that'll likely be toppled over by a cow before the decade's out. A sepulchre, though, that's a whole different kettle of fish, and usually a rather pricey one, I might add. It's the final resting place of folks who were mighty impressed with themselves in life, and figured a little hole in the ground just wouldn't do them justice in death. They need a proper monument, a testament to their importance, preferably made of marble so it gleams and blinds you on a sunny day.

You see them dotting the hillsides of Europe mostly, these sepulchres, looking like little Greek temples that wandered off and got lost. Inside, you'll usually find a sarcophagus, which is just a fancy word for a stone box, and quite uncomfortable I imagine. The deceased is often depicted reclining on the lid, looking serene and possibly a bit bored, probably wondering why they spent all that money on this stone chaise lounge when they could have bought a decent rocking chair for eternity.

And the inscriptions! Lord have mercy, the inscriptions. They're always dripping with so much self-aggrandizing hogwash that you could fertilize a whole field with it. "Here lies a man of unparalleled virtue," they'll proclaim, even if the fellow was known around town as a swindler and a skinflint. "A pillar of society, a beacon of light!" you'll read, conveniently forgetting that he foreclosed on widows and cheated orphans out of their meager inheritances. It's enough to make a body wonder if these folks actually knew the people they were burying, or if they just hired a poet with a penchant for hyperbole and a talent for ignoring the truth. The whole affair is a grand, slightly ridiculous, and thoroughly human spectacle, really. A desperate attempt to cheat death out of the last word, even if that word is a blatant lie chiseled in stone.
