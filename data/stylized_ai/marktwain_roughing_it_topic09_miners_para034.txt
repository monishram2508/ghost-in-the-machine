Now, these miners, bless their optimistic souls, were a breed apart. You'd find 'em thick as fleas on a mangy dog around any new diggings, scratching at the earth like chickens after worms. Each one convinced, in his own fool way, that this here hole he'd dug was just plumb bursting with gold, waiting only for his blessed shovel to unleash its glittering glory. Mostly, though, it unleashed little more than backache and disappointment. They’d come West with nary a penny to their name, picturing themselves swimmin' in gold dust before the year was out, but most ended up swimmin' in debt and ditchwater instead.

They were a motley crew, to be sure. There was the feller from back East, all starched collars and book learnin', tryin' to figure out how to pan without getting his manicure dirty – bless his heart, he didn't last a week. Then you had the grizzled old prospector, who claimed he could smell gold in the wind and followed it like a bloodhound, though he was mostly just followin' the smell of his own unwashed socks. And don't forget the fellers who knew a thing or two, maybe even struck it rich once or twice, only to blow it all on whiskey and women down at the saloon faster than you could say “jackrabbit.”

Their claims were a sight to behold, too. A patchwork quilt of holes and heaps of dirt, each one marked with a hand-hewn stake and the owner's name, misspelled more often than not. They'd argue over a few inches of ground like lawyers squabbling over an inheritance, their voices rising above the clatter of picks and shovels like a flock of agitated geese. But underneath all the bluster and the bravado, they were a community of sorts, bound together by the shared dream of striking it rich and the even more shared reality of hard work and harder luck. They'd share a swig of whiskey, a tall tale, and sometimes, even a piece of their meager grub, because out there in the wilderness, a little bit of camaraderie was worth more than all the gold in California.
