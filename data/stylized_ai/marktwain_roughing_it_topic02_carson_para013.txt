Carson City, that's a place I wouldn't trade for two bits, though some might disagree – especially after a Saturday night where the saloons are overflowing and arguments get louder than a coyote choir. Now, Carson ain't no San Francisco, mind you, with its fancy theaters and gilded whatnot. Here, the stage is the dusty street, and the entertainment comes in the form of a runaway mule or a politician trying to explain where all the tax money disappeared to (a trick so impressive, it rivals Houdini). The place ain’t exactly bursting with elegance, unless you consider the sight of a well-dressed gentleman spitting tobacco juice with impressive accuracy to be a mark of sophistication. The buildings are mostly wood, painted in shades of brown that somehow manage to be both drab and blindingly bright under the Nevada sun. One expects them to up and vanish into the ether during a proper gust of wind, though they haven't yet to my knowledge.

The people, well, they're a mixed bag, like a miner's poke filled with fool's gold and a few nuggets of the real stuff. You got your honest hard-working folks trying to scratch a living out of the land, and then you got your claim jumpers, gamblers, and lawyers (which, let's be honest, is practically the same profession out here). They’re all drawn by the promise of silver, or at least the hope of finding enough to buy a decent bottle of whiskey, and all contribute to the character of the place. There’s a certain charm in their rough edges, though; they'll argue with you till the sun sets and then buy you a drink afterwards. They're the sort who’d lend you a hand if your wagon wheel broke down, but charge you double for the privilege. It's a town built on grit, greed, and the occasional hailstorm, but after a while, a fella might just find himself calling it home, rough edges and all.
