Now, this Neckar River, bless its meandering soul, is a peculiar thing, ain't it? One might expect, given its German pedigree and the stern, efficient reputation of the folk who dwell along its banks, a river of grim purpose, flowing with the relentless precision of a clockwork toy. But no, the Neckar, it has a mind of its own, as willful as a mule in a flower garden. It wriggles and squiggles, cuts a jig through valleys greener than a novice's envy, and seems determined to take the longest possible route from its birth in the Black Forest to its final surrender to the Rhine.

You’ll find Heidelberg draped along its shoulders like a well-worn shawl, its castle a romantic ruin looming above, a blatant attempt to impress the impressionable tourist. And you just know that castle has seen its share of shenanigans over the centuries, enough whispered secrets and spilled wine to fill the river twice over. Further down, the towns sprout from the riverside like mushrooms after a rain, each claiming to be more charming and quaint than the last, a contest of architectural cuteness that threatens to overwhelm the senses. They practically trip over themselves trying to sell you postcards depicting half-timbered houses and overflowing window boxes, each more precariously perched than the last.

And the people! Oh, the Germans along the Neckar. A sturdy lot, these, with a fondness for sausages and a healthy suspicion of strangers. They cultivate their vineyards with a dedication bordering on religious fervor, convinced, no doubt, that the fate of civilization rests on the quality of their Riesling. They bicycle along the riverbanks with a solemn purpose, as if late for a vital appointment with a spreadsheet or a particularly dense philosophical treatise. They are, in short, the very embodiment of German-ness, only slightly softened by the mellow influence of the Neckar’s gentle, meandering flow. Still, I wouldn't try skimming stones on their stretches; that’d be the surest way of raising the suspicions of a nation trained to think and think and think of what makes a pebble skip.
