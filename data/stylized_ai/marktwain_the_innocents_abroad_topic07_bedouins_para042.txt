Now, the Bedouin, you see, is a creature altogether peculiar, a chap marinated in sand and sun since he was a babe squalling for dates instead of milk. He's a fella who calls the howling desert his home, mind you, which is something like calling a particularly prickly cactus your favorite armchair. He swats flies with the air of a sultan and guides camels with a whisper that could charm the gold fillings out of a miser’s teeth. They say he can read the stars like a newspaper, knows the secret language of the dunes, and can smell water bubbling up a mile away. Preposterous, of course, unless you happen to be lost in the Empty Quarter with a parched throat and a Bedouin offering you a skin of dubious looking water that tastes like heaven itself.

He’s got a face etched with the woes and wisdom of generations, all squinting into sandstorms and haggling over goats. And Lord, can they haggle! You’d think they were born with a miniature bazaar rattling around in their brains, constantly calculating the true worth of a camel’s left eyelash. His wardrobe consists mainly of flowing robes, the color of dust, which seem to gather sand like a magnet attracts iron filings. And on his head, that fearsome headdress, the keffiyeh, which manages to be both remarkably practical for keeping the sun at bay and equally effective at concealing a sly grin when he's just swindled a city-slicker out of a year’s wages for a donkey that’s clearly on its last legs. He is, in short, a walking, talking, sand-encrusted enigma, this Bedouin. A man of proud traditions, flexible morals (when necessary, of course, for the sake of survival), and a surprisingly wicked sense of humor, considering the grim landscape he inhabits. Just don’t ever try to beat him at a game of backgammon, unless you fancy donating your entire camel herd to the worthy cause of his entertainment.
