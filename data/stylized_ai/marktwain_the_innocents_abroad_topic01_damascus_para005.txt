Damascus, bless its ancient, dusty heart! Why, I reckon if old Methuselah himself were to stroll its bazaars, he'd still feel like a greenhorn, overwhelmed by the sheer antiquity of the place. It's a city so steeped in history, you practically trip over it, like some absent-minded professor stumbling over a poorly-placed Roman column while trying to recall the price of figs. They say Cain slew Abel somewhere in this neck of the woods, though I wouldn't bet my last dollar on it – those fellas back then weren't known for their meticulous record-keeping. The houses, mind you, are crammed together like sardines in a tin, all vying for a sliver of sunlight, and the streets? Well, the streets are a glorious, bewildering chaos of donkeys, merchants hawking their wares (most likely something passed down through the ages that no one knows what it's really used for) and the occasional bewildered tourist like myself, convinced he's stumbled onto the set of a biblical epic gone wonderfully awry. And the smells! A symphony of roasted lamb, sweet pastries, and something vaguely resembling a stable, all blended together in a potent perfume that clings to you like a lovesick leech. They boast about Damascus steel, of course, and you can find fellows willing to sell you a “genuine” blade that I suspect was forged last Tuesday by a blacksmith with a caffeine addiction. Still, there's a romance to the deception, a certain charming audacity that one can't help but admire. It's a city where time seems to move at a snail’s pace, where haggling over a rug can take the better part of an afternoon, and where you can be certain that whatever you think you know, Damascus has a secret or two up its sleeve, just waiting to be uncovered – or perhaps better left buried beneath layers of sand and centuries of fascinating folly.
