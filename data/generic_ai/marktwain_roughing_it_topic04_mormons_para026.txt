Mormons, formally known as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, are a Christian-based religious group with unique theological beliefs and practices rooted in the teachings of Joseph Smith, who founded the faith in the early 19th century. Central to their belief system is the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible, which they believe is a record of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. This book narrates the story of a group of people who migrated from Jerusalem to the Americas around 600 BC and traces their history until about 400 AD, including a visit by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. Mormons believe that the early Christian Church fell into apostasy after the death of the original apostles, losing key doctrines and authority, and that Joseph Smith restored the fullness of the gospel through divine revelation. They emphasize the importance of personal revelation and a living prophet leading the Church today.

Mormon worship typically involves weekly Sunday services centered around prayer, hymns, sermons, and the sacrament, which is a ritual remembrance of Jesus Christ's sacrifice. They place a strong emphasis on family, community, and service to others. A distinctive characteristic of Mormon culture is the practice of tithing, where members donate ten percent of their income to the Church. This is used to fund various Church activities, including building and maintaining temples, providing welfare assistance, and supporting missionary work. Missionary service is a significant aspect of young adult Mormon life, with many young men and women volunteering to serve full-time missions, typically lasting 18-24 months, in locations around the world. They dedicate their time to sharing their faith and engaging in community service. Mormons have faced historical persecution, including forced migrations, due to their unique beliefs and practices. Despite these challenges, the Church has grown significantly and now has a global presence with millions of members worldwide. They actively participate in interfaith dialogues and are known for their strong stance on moral values and community involvement.
