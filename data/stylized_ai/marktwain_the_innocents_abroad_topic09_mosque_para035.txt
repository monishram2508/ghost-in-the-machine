Now, about this mosque business, I reckon I’ve seen a fair few in my travels, from the grand affairs in Constantinople, all glittering like a sultan's jewelry box, to humble mud-brick affairs out in the boondocks where the only thing grand was the devotion of the fellas inside. And you know, after seeing so many, you start to notice a few things that stick out like a sore thumb in a tea party. First off, these minarets, these skinny towers that poke up to the heavens. They always reminded me of a fella tryin' to shout louder than the next one, each vying for the ear of the Almighty, I suppose. Reminds you a bit of politicians on the campaign trail, except hopefully, these callers to prayer are a little less likely to steal your silverware.

And then there's the carpets. Now, these ain't your grandma’s doilies, mind you. They stretch out like a sultan's picnic blanket, intricately woven with patterns that could hypnotize a hummingbird. You'd think they were designed to make it comfy for prostrating, but I suspect it’s also to give the eye something to look at while you’re pondering the mysteries of the universe. Because let's be honest, even the most devout soul has moments where his thoughts wander to that unpaid bill or whether or not the missus is gonna be mad about that poker game last Tuesday.

And the people! Ah, the people. You find 'em all, from the somber old gents with beards long enough to braid, to the fidgeting young lads who can barely keep still during the sermon. They all line up, shoulder to shoulder, bowing and rising as one, which is a sight to behold, even if you ain’t entirely sure what they’re saying in Arabic. But the important thing, seems to me, is that they're all in it together, searching for something, hoping for something, just like the rest of us poor mortals stumbling through this life. And you know, in a world full of bickering and squabbling, maybe that ain't such a bad thing to find, eh?
