Now, Pard, there's a word that hangs around these here parts like a persistent mosquito in July. Pard. Short for partner, see? But it ain't just about business, mind you. A man could be your pard in a gold claim, a card game, or a brawl outside the saloon. Matter of fact, I've known more fellas who considered me their pard after a good scrap than before. Makes you wonder about their judgment, it does. Usually, the claim of "pard" comes with a significant need. Like, "Pard, you got a spare five dollars 'til I strike it rich?" Or, "Pard, that fella with the six-shooter is lookin' mighty unhappy, maybe you could distract him?"

The funnier part, though, is how easily the title gets flung around. A man could rob you blind, sell you a mule with consumption, and still call you "pard" with a straight face. And then expect you to buy him a drink! It's a peculiarity of the West, I reckon, this peculiar ease with which trust is granted, and then so quickly, thoroughly betrayed. I once saw a fella declare himself a pard to a grizzly bear, just 'fore the bear declared *him* dinner. Showed real initiative, though, you gotta give him that. 

There’s a kind of irony, you see, in clinging to the idea of partnership, the camaraderie of it, even when the reality is usually some form of exploitation. It's like believing that the setting sun will always bring a pot of gold, despite all evidence to the contrary. We're all just fools chasing the horizon, hoping to find someone who'll share the dream, and perhaps, even the burden, of the chase. Though I wouldn’t bet my last nickel on finding one who doesn’t also plan on takin' the biggest share of the pot when we finally get there, should we ever actually strike it. Then again, maybe I'm just a cynic. Or maybe I’ve just been called "pard" one too many times.
