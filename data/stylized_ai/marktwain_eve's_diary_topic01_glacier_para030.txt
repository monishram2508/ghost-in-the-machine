Now, this glacier, bless its icy heart, it's quite the spectacle, even if it is a bit slow-moving for my liking. Imagine, if you will, a frozen river, wider than the Mississippi at flood stage and thicker than a congressman's head, inching its way down a mountain as if it's contemplating a very difficult arithmetic problem. And mind you, it has all the time in the world to ponder it, seeing as how it’s been at it for, well, centuries, give or take a few eons. It's got these deep, blue crevasses that look like the devil himself took a swipe at it with a celestial ice pick, and you wouldn't want to fall into one, no sirree, unless you fancy becoming a rather chilly exhibit for some future scientist to gawk at.

And the rocks! Oh, the rocks that glacier carries along! It's like a pack rat with a penchant for boulders. They're all scraped and scarred, each one a silent witness to the glacier's slow, ponderous journey. I half expected to see a few etchings on them – perhaps a complaint from some ancient mammoth about the chilly climate, or maybe a love poem dedicated to a particularly hardy tundra flower. The glacier, it simply plows along, oblivious to the history it's hauling, like some old professor utterly engrossed in his own thoughts while dragging a sack of overdue library books behind him. And the meltwater, that’s a trick of its own. Clear as gin and so cold it could freeze the whiskers off a polar bear, it carves its way through the landscape with all the force of a temperance preacher condemning whiskey. All in all, you could sit and watch it for hours, that glacier, although I wouldn't recommend it unless you've got a good thermos of hot coffee and a penchant for contemplating the vastness of time, the fragility of life, and the peculiar habits of large bodies of ice.
