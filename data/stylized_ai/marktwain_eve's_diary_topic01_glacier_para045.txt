Well, this glacier, bless its frigid heart, it’s a sight to behold, though not in the way those city-folk go on about sunsets and whatnot. You see, it ain't no sudden, fiery explosion of color, more like a slow, stubborn accumulation of… well, of cold. A lot of cold. Enough cold to give even the Devil himself the shivers, I reckon. It started, they say, with a few snowflakes, each one thinking it was going to just melt away and become a puddle to reflect the sky. But then another one joins it, and another, and pretty soon you have enough snowflakes to form a committee, and committees, as we all know, are good at sticking around, even if they don’t actually accomplish much.

And that's how you get a glacier, a great, slow-moving committee of frozen water. It lumbers down the mountain, looking like a giant, blue-tinged tongue sticking out to lick the landscape clean. It scrapes along, carving out valleys and carrying boulders as big as houses, all the while making a groaning noise that sounds suspiciously like it's complaining about the workload. You’d think something that big wouldn’t need to grumble, but there you have it. Even glaciers got their cross to bear. 

Now, I've heard tell that these glaciers are shrinking, disappearing quicker than a politician's promise. Seems a shame, doesn’t it? All that effort, all that cold, just to vanish into a puddle and float out to sea. Makes you wonder if maybe we should start charging admission. “See the Glacier While You Still Can! Last Chance to Freeze Your Toes Off!” We could put up a little gift shop too, sell miniature glaciers made out of rock candy. Folks would buy ‘em, I’m sure. They buy anything these days. But I'll just sit here and observe nature's strange, icy contraption until it's gone. Then I'll complain that nothing is like it used to be. What else is an old timer supposed to do?
