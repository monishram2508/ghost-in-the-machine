A sepulchre, you say? Well now, that's a word that'll conjure up images of damp stone, cobwebs thick as Mississippi fog, and maybe even a misplaced skeleton or two playing hide-and-seek with respectability. Some folks go in for sepulchres something fierce, building 'em bigger than my Aunt Mildred's boarding house and fancier than a riverboat gambler's waistcoat. Seems a powerful odd thing, when you consider that the sole tenant ain't likely to appreciate the frescoed ceilings or the imported marble. Makes a body wonder if they're not really building it for themselves, a sort of preemptive brag about how important they were, hoping to impress the worms. 

I recollect old man Peabody, richest man in Pike County (though tighter than a drum), he built himself a sepulchre that looked like a miniature Roman temple. Claimed it was for the "preservation of his mortal remains," but I suspect he just didn't want to be caught dead in the same graveyard as the common folk. Had gargoyles carved with his own sour face, just to scare off any afterlife party crashers, I reckon. And when he finally kicked the bucket, they lowered him down with ropes so thick they could tow a steamboat. He never did say how he planned on keeping the rain out with no roof on the blasted thing, but I imagine his heirs have solved that riddle by now, with a tarp and a prayer, no doubt. It all struck me as a colossal waste of good money, when a nice, simple pine box and a bit of dirt would have done the trick just as well. But then again, what do I know? I'm just a simple observer of human folly, jotting down notes for the angels, or perhaps for the devil, depending on how charitable I'm feeling that day. And I swear, some folks seem to be building their sepulchres for him.
