Now, about this portier business. Adam, bless his simple heart, insisted on callin’ it a “door hangin’,” which just goes to show you the depths of his linguistic poverty. A door hangin’ indeed! As if that scrap of velvet and fringe was merely clingin’ on for dear life, like a tick on a buffalo. No, a portier, you see, is so much more than just somethin’ to keep the draft from snappin’ at your heels. It’s a statement, a declaration of…well, I ain’t entirely sure what it declares, but it’s somethin' important, I reckon. I picked out a particularly audacious one, a rich, deep crimson affair, practically bleatin’ its sophistication from the branch where I found it. Now, Adam, he just looked at it with that confounded bewildered expression of his, like I'd tried to explain the principles of fly-fishin’ to a newborn lamb. "What’s the purpose, Eve?" he’d ask, as if everything in this new world needed a practical, utilitarian reason for existin’.

"Purpose?" I'd retort, tossin' my hair, “Why, to add a certain…je ne sais quoi, Adam! To prevent us from lookin’ like we’re livin’ in a cave even more than we already are!” He wouldn’t understand, of course. To him, it was just an obstruction, somethin’ gettin' in the way of a clear shot from the sleeping area to the, shall we say, “dining nook.” He probably thought I was just tryin’ to show off, puttin’ on airs like a peacock wearin’ a dinner jacket. But I wasn’t! Well, maybe a little. Truth be told, I just wanted to make our humble abode a wee bit more… civilized. And besides, it hid the fact that I hadn’t quite figured out how to properly weave leaves into a presentable wall. Sometimes, I swear, Adam's utter lack of appreciation for the finer things in life makes me want to trade him in for a slightly less hairy orangutan with a better eye for interior decor.
