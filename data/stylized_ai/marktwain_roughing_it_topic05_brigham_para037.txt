Brigham, ah, Brigham Young! Now there’s a fellow who could spin a yarn and build an empire both before breakfast, and likely blame the flies for any mistakes afterwards. A prophet, they called him. More like a captain with a leaky raft and a map drawn on a buffalo hide, pointing west with the unwavering conviction of a man who’d just swallowed a compass. I reckon the Donner party might have offered a bit of advice on mountain travel, had they been around. But who needs advice when you’ve got a vision and a wagon train full of believers, each one more willing than the last to trade sense for salvation? Salt Lake City, that's what he conjured out of the dust and sagebrush; a city built on faith, hard work, and, if you listen to the gossips, a fair bit of polygamy. Polygamy, they whispered. A peculiar institution, to be sure, but a powerful tool for population growth, wouldn't you agree? Made Mr. Mormon into a kind of glorified rabbit, I suppose.

The land he chose, though, bless his ambitious heart, was barren enough to make a buzzard reconsider his career. Water scarce as hen's teeth, soil so salty you could pickle a politician in it, and mountains so tall they cast shadows clear back to Missouri. Still, Brigham wasn't one to let a little adversity spoil his plans. He’d plant a garden in hell if he thought it would grow the right kind of converts, and likely lecture the devil on proper irrigation techniques while he was at it. He ruled that territory with an iron fist wrapped in a velvet glove, and woe betide any gent that crossed him. But he also kept the peace, after his own fashion, and built a civilization where civilization had no business being. A strange bird, Brigham Young, a peculiar institution all by himself. Half saint, half scoundrel, and all American, I reckon. A man who proved that with enough willpower and a dedicated following, you can turn a desert into... well, a slightly less desolate desert, anyway.
