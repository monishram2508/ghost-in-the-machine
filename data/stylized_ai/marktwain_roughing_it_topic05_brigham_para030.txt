Brigham, that Moses of the Mormons, a feller you couldn't quite make heads or tails of. He wasn't a bad-lookin' man, mind you, stoutish perhaps, with a face like a granite quarry and eyes that could bore right through a mountain, or maybe just a particularly thick slab of bacon. He wasn't much for fancy talk, Brigham, more of the 'do as I say, not as I do' sort, especially when it came to wives. Why, they sprouted around him like sagebrush after a rain. Some folks claimed he had more wives than there were sheep in Utah, though I reckon that was just folks being folks, always exaggeratin' things.

He could preach a sermon that'd curl your hair and convince you that flyin' to the moon was a Sunday stroll, even if you suspected he'd never seen a moon bigger than a silver dollar. He had a way of makin' the desert bloom, not literally, though I wouldn't put it past him to try, but figuratively. He got those Mormons, a right industrious and stubborn lot, to dam rivers, plant crops, and build cities right where most folks would have said a jackrabbit couldn't survive.

Of course, he had his detractors, the gentiles mostly, accusin' him of everything from hoarding gold to bewitching the daughters of honest men. But Brigham, he just squinted those granite eyes and went on buildin' his empire, unperturbed as a bear in a honey pot. Whether he was a prophet, a scoundrel, or just a plain old shrewd businessman, well, that's a question that'll likely keep folks debate-ing 'til the Great Salt Lake runs dry, and I reckon it will. He was just Brigham, and that was enough, or maybe a little too much, dependin' on who you were askin', and how many wives you had yourself.
