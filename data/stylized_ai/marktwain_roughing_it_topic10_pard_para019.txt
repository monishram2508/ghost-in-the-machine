Well now, pard, let's palaver a spell about this here creature, this "pard," as some folks call 'em. More civilized circles might whisper "leopard," but out here on the frontier, we ain't got time for fancy pronunciations. We got gold to find, whiskey to drink, and mountains to outsmart, and the proper name of a spotted cat ain't high on the list. Anyway, this pard, he's a right fine looking fella, all decked out in a coat that'd make a gambler envious - perfect spots, you see, arranged with the sort of artistry that puts a preacher's stained glass to shame. And don't let that purdy coat fool ya, though. He ain't no parlor pet. He's got claws sharper than a claim jumper's wit and teeth that could shear through a side of beef easier than a hot knife through butter. I reckon he uses 'em, too. 

Seen one time, down by the Snake River, a pard come sauntering along like he owned the whole blamed territory. A deer, poor, unsuspecting thing, was sippin' water, mindin' its own business. In the blink of an eye, that pard was a blur of yellow and black, a silent thunderbolt. Heard a little bleat, then nothin'. Clean as a whistle, it was, and faster than you could say "Jack Robinson." Fact is, that pard knew how to make a livin', no doubt about it. He wasn't no blustering blowhard, neither, like some fellas you meet in a saloon. He didn't need to brag. He just did what he needed to do with a quiet efficiency that bordered on arrogance. It's a trait I admire, even if I'd prefer not to be on the receivin' end of it. And I reckon, seeing him there, all muscle and stealth and perfectly placed spots, that civilization ain't got a patch on the raw, untamed beauty of these here wild lands. And that pard, he's a livin', breathin' testament to it. A handsome devil, he is, even if he'd likely turn me into breakfast without a second thought.
