Now, these miners, bless their optimistic souls, were a breed apart, you see. They were generally men who'd failed at everything else in life, which made them, in a twisted way, exceptionally qualified for mining. After all, who but a man accustomed to disappointment could face a hardscrabble claim that hadn't coughed up a speck of gold in six months and still declare, with a twinkle in his eye and a swig of rotgut whiskey, that "she's just about to hit paydirt, boys!" They arrived in droves, these hopefuls, from every corner of the earth, armed with pickaxes, shovels, and a level of naivete that would make a newborn babe look worldly wise. You'd see 'em sporting names like "Lucky" something-or-other, or "Honest" Jim, names so patently absurd given their actual circumstances they were almost comical.

They lived in shacks that made chicken coops look luxurious, ate grub that would gag a buzzard, and spent their evenings arguing over the merits of various get-rich-quick schemes. Most had about as much understanding of geology as a jackrabbit, but that didn't stop them from pontificating on the subterranean wonders that lay beneath their boots. I recall one fella, claimed he could smell gold a mile off, though I suspect his sense of smell was more attuned to the aroma of a freshly brewed cup of coffee at the assay office than any precious metal. They were a superstitious bunch, too, prone to believing in everything from leprechauns guarding hidden veins to bad luck brought on by whistling underground. And let me tell you, the sound of a miner whistling off-key in a dark, damp tunnel was enough to drive a sane man to seek employment as a claim jumper, just for the relative peace and quiet. They were fools, maybe, but they were *our* fools, and they were the engine that powered the boom. Without their stubborn refusal to admit defeat, their boundless optimism, and their collective gullibility, the West would have been a much duller place indeed.
