Well now, a sepulchre. That's a fancy word for a hole in the ground, ain't it? Though often it's more than just a hole, more like a furnished apartment for the deceased, only considerably less lively, naturally. I reckon the quality of the sepulchre speaks volumes about the fella residing within, or rather, resided. A grand mausoleum, all marble and pronouncements carved in stone, tells you this chap had a bit of influence, or at least a family with a stubborn streak and a healthy bank account. But a simple mound with a weathered marker? That's likely a hardworking soul, known more for his calloused hands than his silver tongue, resting as peaceful as he can manage, considering he's under six feet of dirt.

I’ve seen sepulchres that'd make a pharaoh blush, full of trinkets and baubles meant to ease the journey to the afterlife. Reminds me of a fella back in Hannibal, old man Peabody, who insisted on being buried with his prize-winning pumpkin and a complete set of dentures, "Just in case," he said. Always was a practical sort, even in death. And then there are the plain ones, the forgotten ones, where the inscriptions have faded and the weeds have taken over. Those are the saddest, I think. Not because the inhabitant is any less dead, mind you, but because it signifies they've been forgotten by the living, which is a fate worse than, well, you know.

Folks go to great lengths to secure a good resting place. They build 'em high, they build 'em deep, they fill 'em with things they think they'll need on the other side. All that effort, just to end up lying still as a stump. Makes you wonder if they’re doing it for themselves, or for the living folks who’ll come to visit, weep a bit, and then go back to their own troubles. Likely a bit of both, I suppose. Human nature is a curious thing, even when it's planning for its own extinction. But one thing’s for certain, no matter how grand or humble, every sepulchre tells a story, if you’re willing to listen close. And some stories, well, they’re just best left buried.
