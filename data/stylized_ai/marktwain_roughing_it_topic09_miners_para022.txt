Them miners, bless their dust-covered souls, were a breed apart, I tell you what. Picture a feller, face grimed like he'd been kissing a stovepipe, beard thick enough to house a family of sparrows, and eyes that squinted at the world like it owed him a fortune – usually, it did. They’d come flocking to these boomtowns faster than flies to a molasses spill, each convinced they were one pickaxe swing away from striking the Comstock Lode itself. Most, of course, ended up striking nothing but hard rock and harder luck. You'd see 'em lounging in saloons, smelling strongly of gunpowder and stale whiskey, arguing over whose claim was richest, whose burro was dumber (a hotly contested category, mind you), and whose luck was the worst. Said luck, by the way, was almost universally terrible. A miner could sneeze and a rich vein would collapse, he could whistle a merry tune and find his water supply dried up, he could dream of gold nuggets the size of hen's eggs, only to wake up and find a rattlesnake sharing his blanket.

They were gamblers, every last one of 'em, risking life and limb for the glittering promise of fortune. They'd sink their last dollar into a grubstake, or a 'grubsteak' as some less-than-literate fellers called it, as if the steak itself was providing the capital. And their fashion sense? Lord have mercy. You could spot a miner a mile away – flannel shirts patched with more flannel, pants held up by sheer willpower and a suspicious length of rope, and boots that had clearly seen better decades. But underneath the dirt and the desperation, there was a certain stubbornness, a resilience that bordered on the admirable. They might grumble and gripe, they might swear a blue streak that would peel paint off a barn, but they'd keep digging. Because, you see, even if they didn't strike it rich, they could always tell a tall tale about the time they almost did. And in these parts, a good story was almost as valuable as gold, anyway. Almost.
