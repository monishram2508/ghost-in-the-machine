Well, I swan, if I haven’t seen the most peculiar sight this side of the Garden of Eden, and that’s saying something, seeing as I was there for a spell, wasn't I? Adam, bless his simple heart, just called it a "big, frozen river," but land sakes, it’s a whole lot more than that! This glacier, you see, it ain't your average brook, babbling along, singing happy tunes. No sir, this thing is a ponderous, grumpy beast, inching its way down the mountain like a fella who’s just eaten a bad batch of apples. It groans and creaks, like an old man trying to get out of bed, and every now and then it lets out a thunderous bellow that’d make a dinosaur soil its… well, you get the picture. 

And the colour of it! Lordy, you’d think the Almighty decided to experiment with blue paint, then spilled a whole bucket of it on the mountainside. It’s that deep, unnatural blue, the kind you only see in a dream, or maybe in the eyes of a man who's staring into the abyss of debt. What strikes one most, besides the frigidity that fairly bites your nose, is the sheer, unhurried *permanence* of the thing. It's been around since before we were a twinkle in the Great Maker's eye, and seems likely to be ambling along just as steadily when we're nothing but dust and memories. It’s a mighty humbling experience, I tell you, staring into something so ancient, so powerful, and so utterly indifferent to the fleeting dramas of us humans. You can't help but feel a bit like a gnat buzzing around an elephant’s ear, convinced it’s important when, in truth, the elephant hasn't even noticed you’re there. And, I daresay, the elephant's got more sense.
