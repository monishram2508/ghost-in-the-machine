We tramped up that mountain, Adam and I, puffing and panting like a pair of asthmatic blacksmiths, just to have a gander at this so-called glacier. A glacier, mind you! I’d heard tell of them being right impressive, a river of ice so ancient it made Methuselah look like a spring chicken. Well, I’ll tell you what, the reality was a bit like ordering a prize-winning pig at the county fair and getting a scrawny little runt with one ear. It was… bluish, I suppose, if you squinted and had a generous disposition. Mostly it looked like a heap of frozen slush, the sort you might find behind a saloon in January, only bigger and considerably less inviting.

Adam, bless his simple heart, was quite taken with it. He kept pointing out the “moraines,” which, as far as I could tell, were just piles of rocks that had gotten lost and couldn’t find their way home. He claimed they were evidence of the glacier’s “relentless advance.” Relentless! Why, I've seen snails move with more purpose. I reckon if that glacier ever tried to chase after anything, it'd be overtaken by a particularly lazy tortoise before it got halfway.

And the noise! They said it was the sound of the glacier groaning and cracking under its own weight, a dramatic and mournful lament for a bygone era. All I heard was a lot of drippy, gurgling noises, the sort you associate with a leaky kitchen tap or a very large and unhappy hippopotamus. It struck me then that everything has to melt, everything declines and loses that wonderful charm of youth. Even mountains will turn to sand, that is a sad thing but this glacier was a prime example of how things once magnificent, turn into something that resembles a half-melted block of ice. But it was still an adventure, and with Adam, even a lukewarm ice cube could be made amusing. We took some more pictures and walked off, not sure what we had seen, but glad we saw it together.
