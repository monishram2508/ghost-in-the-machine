Now, consider the Bedouin, a fellow possessed, seemingly, of an unwavering dedication to wandering about in deserts where even a sensible lizard would pack its bags and emigrate to a slightly less incandescent patch of gravel. He is, you see, a creature forged in the crucible of hardship, and I use "forged" in the loosest sense of the word, since their smithies mostly involve repurposing camel dung for… well, I haven’t quite figured that part out yet. They are, as I observed during my own, brief and thoroughly regretted foray into the Arabian expanse, remarkably skilled at existing on what appears to be precisely nothing. A bit of dates, a thimble of water, and the occasional philosophical argument about the finer points of camel etiquette seem to suffice.

Their tents, these portable havens, are contraptions of woven goat hair, looking for all the world like perpetually disgruntled, earth-toned spiders. One expects them to scuttle off at any moment, offended by a careless glance or an ill-timed sneeze. And yet, within these seemingly fragile structures, one finds a hospitality that would shame the finest hotels in Constantinople. Offer them tea, made stronger than sin and sweeter than a politician's promise, and they will, after a due period of courteous protestation, drink enough to float a decent-sized galleon. And talk, they will talk! Tales of brave raids, improbable genealogies stretching back to the dawn of time, and, naturally, endless debates about the relative merits of various camels; each beast seemingly possessed of its own unique and nuanced personality, capable of subtle betrayals and heart-wrenching displays of loyalty. It's enough to make a man believe that perhaps these sun-baked nomads know something the rest of us have forgotten, that there's a certain peculiar wisdom to be found in embracing the emptiness, and becoming intimately acquainted with the temperamental whims of a particularly stubborn, four-legged beast. Though, frankly, I'd still rather have a bathtub.
