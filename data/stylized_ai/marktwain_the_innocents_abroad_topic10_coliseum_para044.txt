Ah, the Coliseum, that grand old ruin in Rome, they call it. A place where, centuries gone, they’d gather a mob, ten times the size of a Mississippi steamboat crowd on a Saturday night, all hankering for a bit of sport, and what sort of sport, pray tell? Why, men hacking at each other with swords, or maybe a lion deciding to have a gladiator for luncheon. Perfectly civilized, you see. One imagines the Emperor, fat as a tick on a hound dog, sitting up in his box, giving a thumbs up or down depending on how well the poor blighter entertained him before becoming lion chow. 

Now, I’ve seen a bear fight or two in my day, down in Calaveras County, but this Roman affair, this was on a scale to make a Californian gold rush boomtown blush. You could fit the entire population of Hannibal, Missouri inside that arena, and still have room left over for a donkey race. And the noise! Like a thousand church choirs all singing slightly different tunes, none of them quite right, while a brass band practices nearby and a flock of geese honk their disapproval.

They say it was all for the glory of Rome. Maybe so, but I reckon a little less glory and a little more charity wouldn't have hurt. All those poor souls, butchered and devoured for the amusement of the masses. Makes a man wonder about the progress of civilization, doesn't it? Here we are, supposedly enlightened, and we still crowd around to watch a prize fight, or worse, a political debate. Perhaps we haven't come as far as we think. Still, the Coliseum stands there, a stark reminder of a time when entertainment meant blood and guts, and a good seat cost you your conscience, or maybe your very life. A grand spectacle, to be sure, but one that leaves a bit of a sour taste in the mouth, like a day-old clam that thought it could still fool you.
