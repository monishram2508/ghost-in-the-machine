Naples, ah, a city that could charm the very scales off a dragon, or perhaps, just as likely, pickpocket it blind before it could even exhale a puff of smoke. I've seen more life crammed into a Neapolitan alleyway than some entire countries could boast, though I wouldn't necessarily call it *polite* life, mind you. It's a swirling, chaotic opera of humanity, where the tenor is always shouting, the soprano’s perpetually outraged, and the audience throws rotten tomatoes at the slightest misstep - usually involving a donkey cart blocking the thoroughfare. One navigates the streets not so much by walking, but by dodging scooters piloted by teenagers who seem to believe traffic laws are merely quaint suggestions, and vendors hawking wares with a zeal that could convert a heathen to capitalism in a single breath. And the garbage! Good heavens, the garbage! It's a mountain range of discarded produce, fish bones, and the occasional suspicious-looking boot, all presided over by stray cats who seem to have struck some sort of unholy bargain with the sanitation department. The famed Vesuvius looms in the distance, a grand, dormant volcano which I suspect only adds to the Neapolitans’ devil-may-care attitude. After all, when one lives under the perpetual threat of being buried alive under molten rock, a little street brawl over parking seems hardly worth the bother. Yet, despite the squalor and the clamor and the general air of organized anarchy, there's a certain vitality that's undeniably appealing. It’s a city that grabs you by the scruff of the neck, shakes you thoroughly, and then offers you a plate of the most divine pizza you’ve ever tasted. And you, fool that you are, find yourself strangely grateful for the experience, even if you can’t quite explain why. It's a puzzle, this Naples, a glorious, frustrating, utterly irresistible puzzle.
