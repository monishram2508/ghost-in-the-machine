Heidelberg! Ach, Heidelberg! A town of such romantic pretensions, it practically weeps poetry onto the cobblestones. One half expects to see nymphs bathing in the Neckar, only to be sorely disappointed by the sight of stout German matrons doing their laundry. The castle, bless its ruined heart, lords over the town like a tipsy uncle recounting the glorious, and probably exaggerated, battles of his youth. One can almost hear him wheezing about sieges and emperors, the stones groaning under the weight of historical baggage. The students, naturally, are a vital component of the spectacle. They sport these peculiar little caps, which, I am informed, denote their particular fraternity. They strut about with an air of great importance, as if possessing the collected wisdom of Aristotle and having also invented a superior recipe for sauerkraut. 

The beer gardens, of course, are where the real drama unfolds. There, surrounded by oompah music and the aroma of sausages of dubious origin, one can observe the German character in its full, glorious, and frequently tipsy bloom. They are a people of great sentimentality, these Germans, prone to breaking into song at the slightest provocation, particularly if the provocation is a sufficient quantity of beer. And one should never underestimate their talent for making mountains of wurst disappear at an alarming rate. The tourists, bless their eager, camera-wielding hearts, are a species all their own. They flock to Heidelberg like moths to a particularly picturesque flame, hoping, I suspect, to capture a slice of German romance to take home and frame alongside their collection of miniature Eiffel Towers. One almost feels sorry for them, these earnest souls, searching for authenticity in a town that has long since learned to play to the gallery. But, then again, perhaps the performance *is* the authenticity, and we are all just players on Heidelberg's grand, if somewhat theatrical, stage. A rather pleasant stage, I must admit, especially when viewed through the rosy filter of a good German Riesling.
