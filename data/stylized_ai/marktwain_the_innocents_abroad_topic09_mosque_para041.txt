Now, about this edifice they call a mosque – a rather curious structure, I must say. I stumbled upon one whilst rambling through Damascus, a city older than Methuselah's beard, and found myself quite intrigued. The exterior, often adorned with these spindly minarets reaching for the heavens like a beggar's hand, seems designed more to prickle the skyline than to inspire awe. One half expects a giant needlepoint to be hanging from one of them. But inside, ah, inside is where the real bewilderment begins. No pews, mind you, none of that comfortable lounging so beloved by Christians in their churches. Instead, carpets sprawled across the floor, inviting the faithful to kneel and bump their foreheads on the ground with impressive regularity. One imagines the janitor must be perpetually exhausted from the wear and tear on said carpets, not to mention the sheer volume of dust motes stirred into a frenzy.

And the calligraphy! Walls plastered with it, twisting and swirling like drunken snakes. I couldn’t decipher a blessed word, of course, but it certainly looked important. The whole scene is orchestrated to inspire awe and reverence, and one has to admit, they manage it rather well. Though, I confess, I kept expecting someone to trip over a rug or sneeze during one of those particularly solemn moments. But no, they carry on with a stoic grace that would shame a wooden Indian. All hushed tones and mumbled prayers, a potent concoction of piety and perhaps a touch of boredom. The whole place leaves you feeling rather insignificant, a mere speck of dust amidst this grand display of devotion. And while I may not entirely understand the specifics of their creed, one has to admire the sheer dedication, the unwavering belief in something unseen, a force that compels them to gather and prostrate themselves toward Mecca with a fervour that is, well, frankly, astonishing.
