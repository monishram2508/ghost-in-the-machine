Genoa, ah, Genoa! A city crammed tighter than a miser's purse, flung carelessly against the Ligurian Sea like a handful of mismatched trinkets. One half expects the whole shebang to slide right off the hillside and into the briny deep at any moment. The streets, bless their crooked little hearts, are but cracks and fissures, barely wide enough for a determined donkey – or, perhaps, a particularly nimble rat. Should you find yourself wandering them, be prepared to be squeezed, jostled, and nearly swallowed whole by the teeming masses, all chattering away in a tongue that sounds suspiciously like cats arguing over a fishbone. And the smells! Good heavens, the smells! A potent brew of brine, spices from the Orient, fish that saw their best days a fortnight past, and something indefinably ancient clinging to the very stones themselves. It's enough to knock a lesser man clean off his feet.

But hold on, hold on, lest you think I'm painting a grim picture here. For amidst the chaos and the clamor, there's a certain charm, a certain… *je ne sais quoi*, as the French would say, that grabs hold of you and refuses to let go. Magnificent palazzi, grand as dukes and twice as haughty, stand shoulder-to-shoulder with humble trattorias where the pasta is made with love and a healthy dose of garlic. And the Genoese themselves, a breed apart. They are shrewd, they are clever, they are tighter with a lira than a drowning man with a life preserver, but they have a certain spark in their eye, a love for their city, that warms even the most cynical of hearts. One might grumble about the crooked streets and the pungent aroma, but one cannot deny the vitality, the sheer, unadulterated *Genoa-ness* of the place. It's a city that assaults the senses, tests the patience, and ultimately, leaves you with a story or two worth telling. Though, mind you, best to check your pockets before you leave. One can never be too careful in a city as lively as this.
