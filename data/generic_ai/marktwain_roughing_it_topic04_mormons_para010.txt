The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian denomination founded by Joseph Smith in the United States in 1830. A key distinguishing feature of Mormon belief is the Book of Mormon, presented as a companion scripture to the Bible, detailing God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. This text, along with the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, forms the scriptural canon alongside the Bible. Mormon theology incorporates familiar Christian concepts like the Trinity, although with some unique interpretations. They believe in a Godhead of three distinct beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, unified in purpose but separate in substance. Central to their faith is the atonement of Jesus Christ, which makes possible the salvation and eternal progression of humanity. Mormons emphasize the importance of personal revelation and a living prophet, considering the current church president to be God's mouthpiece on Earth. Temple worship plays a significant role, involving sacred ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, endowments, and sealings, which are performed vicariously for deceased individuals and are understood to bind families together eternally. Mormons practice a lay ministry, with members volunteering their time and talents to serve in various leadership positions and teaching roles within the church. A strong emphasis is placed on missionary work, with young adults often serving voluntary missions for 18 months to two years, spreading the gospel both domestically and internationally. Community is also vital, with members actively participating in church activities, social events, and welfare programs designed to support those in need within the congregation and the wider community. Historically, Mormons faced persecution and displacement due to their unique beliefs and practices, leading them to settle in the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah. Today, the Church has a global presence, with millions of members worldwide and a growing influence in various aspects of society.
