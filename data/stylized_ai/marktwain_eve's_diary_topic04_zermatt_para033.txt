Zermatt, bless its heart, is a village clinging to the foot of the Matterhorn like a lovesick swain to his darling. And a more imposing darling you’ll hardly find, a jagged, stony brute of a mountain that seems perpetually vexed at the audacity of the puny humans scurrying about its skirts. Why, it stands there so stern and indifferent, one might think it considers us little more than bothersome midges buzzing about a magnificent nose. But bother we do! For here we are, a motley collection of sunburnt Britons, rosy-cheeked Germans, and sundry other continentals, all come to gaze upon this geological behemoth, some to risk life and limb attempting to climb it, and others, like myself, to observe the climbers with a safe distance and a well-poured glass of something fortifying. The air, you see, is frightfully thin up here, requiring constant liquid replenishment.

The village itself is a delightful, if somewhat predictable, collection of chalet-style buildings, each seemingly vying for the title of “Most Picturesque,” though none can truly compete with the Matterhorn looming in the background, the ultimate scene-stealer. There’s a peculiar insistence, too, on electric vehicles – which is all well and good for the environment, I suppose, though watching a miniature buggy zip past laden with skis and luggage does rather shatter the illusion of rustic Alpine charm. One half expects to see a troupe of gnomes piloting them, whistling merry tunes. And the prices! Good heavens, the prices! One pays as dearly for a simple cheese fondue as one might for a small kingdom elsewhere. But then, perhaps that is the price one must pay for proximity to such majestic indifference. After all, beauty, as they say, always comes at a cost, whether it be the sore feet of a mountain climber or the emptied pockets of a gawking tourist such as myself. One can only hope the view, and the cheese, are worth it.
