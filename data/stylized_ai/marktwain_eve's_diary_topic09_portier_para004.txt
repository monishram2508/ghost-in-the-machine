Now, about this Portier, this contraption the humans call a door curtain. Land sakes, if ever there was a frippery designed to baffle the logic of a sensible snake, it's this thing. First off, let's be clear: a door is a door. You open it, you shut it, you know where you stand. But this…this portier hangs there, a shapeless mass of fabric, a sort of suggestion of a door, a hint that maybe, just maybe, privacy resides on the other side. It’s neither here nor there, like a politician’s promise or a preacher’s fire-and-brimstone sermon – full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing unless a draft of air happens to wander by and animate the thing into a ghostly dance.

And the colors! Why, they choose the most confounded hues imaginable, as if a painter with a blindfold and a bucket of leftover dyes went to town. One I saw lately looked for all the world like a battlefield after a particularly messy rainbow fight – purples clashed with greens, oranges warred with yellows, and the whole shebang was trimmed with tassels that looked suspiciously like the tails of dead squirrels. You'd think they were trying to hypnotize you into forgetting why you were even attempting to cross the threshold in the first place.

And the purpose? Goodness gracious, nobody seems quite sure. Some say it's to keep out the chill, but a decent fireplace and a properly constructed wall would do a far better job. Others claim it's for privacy, but I reckon a determined gnat could wriggle its way through the thickest of them. More likely, it's a desperate attempt to inject some "elegance" into a room, which, bless their hearts, is often a lost cause to begin with. It strikes me as a monument to mankind’s peculiar habit of complicating perfectly simple things. Give me a good, solid, honest-to-goodness door any day, one you can bang shut and be done with. This portier, though? It’s a whisper of a wall, a sigh of separation, a sartorial sigh that’s more confusing than comforting, more vexing than valuable. It's like trying to build a fort out of fog, I tell you. Utterly hopeless, but ever so entertaining to observe.
