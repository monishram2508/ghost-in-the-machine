Harris, that man. A specimen of earnestness so profound it verges on the comical. You'd think he was personally responsible for the proper functioning of the solar system, the way he carries on about the minutiae. Why, I recall one sweltering afternoon on the Mississippi, whilst trying to convince him that fishing required more patience than shouting at the fish (a theory he remained unconvinced of, naturally), he became utterly preoccupied with the exact angle the sunbeams struck the river. He pulled out his pocket watch, squinted, and commenced a lecture on celestial mechanics that would have bored a professor to tears. "Eve," he announced, adjusting his spectacles, which were perpetually sliding down his nose, "observe how the refraction of light, combined with the inherent reflectivity of the water's surface, creates… well, creates a considerable glare, hindering our ability to effectively spot bass. Science, my dear girl, is the answer to all things, even angling!"

He's got a mind that wanders down rabbit holes deeper than a badger's burrow. Once, he tried to explain to me the intricacies of the Dewey Decimal System while we were supposedly admiring a particularly picturesque sunset. I swear, the man could find a connection between a daisy and the geopolitical ramifications of the Peloponnesian War. He’s brimming with facts, you see, facts arranged with the meticulous care of a lepidopterist pinning butterflies in a display case. The trouble is, these facts rarely have any bearing on the actual situation at hand. He possesses a certain… what’s the word?… a sort of obliviousness to the human condition, particularly as it concerns simple pleasures like, oh, say, enjoying a quiet evening without a discourse on the socio-economic impact of the Industrial Revolution on candlestick production. Still, I wouldn't trade him. He's a challenge, yes, but a diverting one. Besides, who else would painstakingly calculate the precise number of stars visible on a clear night, only to conclude that there are, undoubtedly, more than one can reasonably count? Such is Harris.
