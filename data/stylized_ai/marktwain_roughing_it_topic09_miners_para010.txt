A miner, you see, ain't your garden-variety fellow. He's a hybrid creature, part badger, part pack-mule, and wholly consumed by the glitter of the almighty dollar, or, more accurately, the promise of it. He arrives in these boomtowns looking like he wrestled a locomotive and lost, all dust and beard and eyes squinted against the glare of the desert sun. He’s got a pickaxe he treats better than his own mother, and a burro named something like "Perseverance" or "Hopeful," which is a damn sight more optimistic than anything you'll hear him utter after a day of swingin’ that pick in a vein that coughed up nothin’ but disappointment. He'll tell you he's just one lucky strike away from bein’ a silver baron, even as he gnaws on a slab of sowbelly and contemplates the merits of selling that "Perseverance" for a bottle of rotgut.

They're a superstitious bunch, these miners, believing in ghosts that haunt the tunnels and knockin' on wood that hasn’t seen the light of day in a century. One old-timer swore blind that a leprechaun guarded his claim, demanding a daily offering of tobacco. Now, I ain’t one to dispute a man’s hallucinations when he’s been breathing rock dust for twenty years, but I reckon that leprechaun had a mighty fine tolerance for plug tobacco. They argue like cats and dogs, these miners do, over the width of a vein or the proper way to prop up a tunnel, but let some claim jumper try to horn in on their territory, and they'll unite faster than you can say "Bonanza." They're a hard lot, no doubt, but there’s a rough kind of honesty to them. They’ll cheat you at poker with a grin, then lend you a hand when your own claim goes bust. Just don't ask 'em about their hygiene, unless you’re lookin’ for a fight or a lecture on the antiseptic properties of good ol’ Nevada dirt.
