The sepulchre, ah, that's a word that conjures up images grand enough to make a Pharaoh blush. Not that Pharaohs are blushing these days, mind you, seeing as how they're mostly desiccated and lounging in sarcophagi themselves. Anyway, a sepulchre. You picture something immense, chiseled from granite quarried by slaves driven mad by the desert sun and the incessant crack of the overseer’s whip. Inside, you imagine, there's a king laid out flatter than a pancake after a steamroller convention, surrounded by more gold than a Mississippi gambler after a lucky night. All very impressive, no doubt, but I reckon the fellow wouldn't mind swapping it for a comfortable armchair and a decent cup of coffee now. After all, what good is opulence when you're six feet under and can't even scratch your nose?

I’ve seen a few sepulchres in my time, ranging from the pretentious mausoleums of robber barons who thought they could buy their way into heaven (good luck with that, fellas) to the humble, moss-covered stones marking the final resting place of honest farmers who worked the land until it worked them right back into it. The difference, you see, isn’t always in the size or the splendor. Sometimes, it's in the story the stone tells. A grand sepulchre might whisper of power and earthly glory, but a simple headstone, carved with a name and a date, can speak volumes about a life lived with quiet dignity and a heart full of love. And, let’s be honest, that's a legacy worth more than all the gold in Fort Knox. Though, I admit, a little gold wouldn't hurt, even in the afterlife. One never knows when one might need to bribe a gatekeeper or two. But that's just me digressing again. The point is, a sepulchre is just a house for the dead. Some are fancier than others, but ultimately, they all serve the same purpose: keeping the departed company with the worms.
