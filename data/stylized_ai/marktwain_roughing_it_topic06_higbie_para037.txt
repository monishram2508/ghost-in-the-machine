Higbie, now there was a specimen. A man built on the grand scale, like one o’ them Roman ruins, only not quite so elegant, you understand. He was proprietor of a claim up on the Comstock, though whether it truly yielded silver, or just stubborn rocks and wishful thinking, remained a perpetual mystery, like trying to understand a Chinaman's laundry ticket. Higbie, bless his hopeful heart, had a faith in that claim that could move mountains, or at least, a sizable pile of tailings. He was always talking about the future, about when he'd strike it rich and buy a mansion in San Francisco, furnished entirely with gold doorknobs and velvet curtains thick enough to suffocate a buffalo. I reckon he’d spend half his waking hours calculating his future fortune down to the last penny, which considering his present income probably consisted mostly of hope and borrowed sugar.

He was a generous cuss, though. Always willing to split a pot of beans with a fellow prospector, even if the beans themselves tasted suspiciously of sand and old boot leather. And his stories! Lordy, could that man spin a yarn. You’d swear he’d personally wrestled grizzly bears, single-handedly diverted floods, and even taught a jackrabbit to play the banjo. Of course, half of it was likely plumb fabrication, but it was told with such gusto, such unblushing conviction, that you couldn't help but be entertained. Never saw him downcast, mind you, even when his luck was at its lowest ebb, which was most of the time. He’d just shrug his shoulders, crack another outlandish joke, and proclaim that tomorrow would be the day his ship came in. I always had a sneaking suspicion Higbie’s ship was perpetually stuck in the mud flats, but his unwavering optimism was a sight to behold, and a reminder that sometimes, the richest strikes aren't found in the earth, but in the spirit of a man who refuses to give up on the dream of 'em.
