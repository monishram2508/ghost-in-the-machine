Pard! Now there's a word that conjures up a feller not quite as close as a brother, 'cause brothers are usually around askin' for things and borrowin' your best mule. But a pard, a real bona fide pard, he's a different breed altogether. He's the feller you can gamble away your last dollar with in Virginia City, then wake up the next mornin' chained to a pump handle, both of you wearin' the same bewildered expression and a thirst that could drain the Truckee River. He’s the feller who’ll cheerfully share a tin of beans with you after a long day prospectin' for gold that’s only ever found by other folks. And by shared, I mean he'll let you scrape the burnt bits off the bottom while he takes the slightly less charred portion.

I recall a pard I had named "Windy" Williams, on account of he talked a blue streak faster than a runaway stagecoach. Windy could charm a rattlesnake out of its skin, or maybe just convince you it’d done it itself while he absconded with the skin. We were diggin’ for silver up near Comstock, and Windy, bless his talkative soul, was convinced we were sittin’ on a bonanza. He claimed he could smell the silver, just like a hound smells a badger. Me, I mostly smelled dust and desperation. Anyway, we dug and dug, and all we found was more dirt and enough quartz to pave the streets of Carson City twice over. But Windy, ever optimistic, he kept sayin', "Just a little deeper, pard! Any day now, we'll be swimmin' in silver!" Of course, "any day now" stretched into weeks, then months. Finally, after a particularly brutal day under the Nevada sun, I flat out told him, "Windy, I reckon we're barkin' up the wrong tree. This mine's drier than a Mormon sermon."

Windy just grinned, that same infuriating grin that could sell ice to an Eskimo, and said, "Now, now, pard. A little perseverance never hurt nobody. Besides, who else am I gonna share these burnt beans with?" And that, I reckon, is the essence of a pard. Not always reliable, not always sober, and certainly not always successful, but always there to share the burnt beans and the hard luck stories with you, all while persuadin' you that maybe, just maybe, tomorrow will be the day you strike it rich. Even if you both know darn well it won't.
