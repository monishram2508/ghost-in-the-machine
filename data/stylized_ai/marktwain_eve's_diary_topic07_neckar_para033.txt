The Neckar, you see, is a river pretending to be grander than it actually is. It ambles along with a leisurely air, as if burdened by the weight of centuries and castles perched precariously on its banks. One half expects it to sigh dramatically, perhaps murmur something about the fickle nature of time and the fleeting beauty of maidenhood. Heidelberg, bless its romantic soul, clings to it like a lovesick swain, painting a picture-postcard scene for all the world to gawk at. One does suspect the river, in its deeper, murkier moments, finds the attention somewhat tiresome, rather like a dowager forced to attend endless balls, smiling politely while wishing for a quiet cup of tea and the solace of her knitting. 

The rafts, oh, the rafts! They lumbered past, carrying timber and presumably, a hearty contingent of river men who, judging by the volume of their boisterous songs, were quite convinced the river flowed solely for their amusement. I dare say the fish disagreed vehemently, likely harboring dreams of a world without such cacophony. One even spotted a man with a ridiculous feathered hat and a pipe, looking for all the world like a pirate captain misplaced in a German fairytale. It wouldn't surprise me a bit if he suddenly brandished a cutlass and demanded tribute from the swans. The swans, mind you, are a haughty lot, gliding along with an air of aristocratic disdain, no doubt convinced they are descended from royalty drowned long ago. They accept the tourists' bread with a grudging air, as though it were their due, and one can almost hear them muttering about the vulgarity of the modern age. Indeed, the Neckar, like most waterways of some antiquity, has seen it all, and probably remembers the good old days when the riffraff stayed firmly on dry land.
