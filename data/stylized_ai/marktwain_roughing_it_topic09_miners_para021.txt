Now, these miners, bless their optimistic hearts, were a breed apart, I tell you. Picture a fella, sunburnt to a crisp even in the shade, clothes looking like they'd lost a wrestling match with a grizzly and lost bad, face dusted with more grime than a chimney sweep's holiday suit, and you're halfway there. They came from every corner of the map, these chaps – Irishmen with blarney thick enough to plaster a house, Germans who approached digging like a scientific experiment gone wrong, Yankees with more patents in their pockets than clean socks, and enough Cornishmen to make you think you'd stumbled into a pasty convention. Each one convinced, deep down in his gold-fevered soul, that tomorrow he'd strike the Mother Lode and be richer than Croesus himself.

Of course, most of them were about as likely to find a diamond mine in their own backyard as they were to find that gold. They'd stake a claim on a patch of dirt that looked suspiciously like every other patch of dirt for miles around, dig a hole deep enough to swallow a mule, and then, after a week or two of backbreaking labor, declare it "played out" and move on to the next promising-looking pile of rocks. The only things they ever seemed to strike rich in were hard luck stories and tall tales. You could sit around a campfire with them for an evening and hear enough yarns to fill a library, each one more preposterous than the last, involving everything from gold nuggets the size of melons to encounters with grizzly bears that quoted Shakespeare. And yet, there was something admirable about their unwavering belief, their refusal to be discouraged by the sheer absurdity of it all. They were optimists, gamblers, and fools, all rolled into one gloriously dusty package. And truth be told, I wouldn't have traded an evening swapping stories with them for all the gold in California.
