Now, the Coliseum in Rome, bless its aged heart, is a spectacle and a half, ain't it? A crumbling mountain of stone and history, where lions had their lunch, and Christians, well, let's just say their vacation plans got permanently altered. One imagines the scene back then, all gladiators and emperors, a roaring mob baying for blood – a bit like a modern political rally, only with more tigers and fewer lawyers, though one suspects the percentages were roughly equal in the villainy department. They say this arena seated fifty thousand folks, a figure I suspect was arrived at after a few generous rounds of Roman wine and perhaps a tad of wishful counting. After all, try cramming fifty thousand people into anything without a fire marshal getting involved, and you'll find yourself with a situation considerably less amusing than a staged fight to the death.

And the echoes! Oh, the echoes that linger within those scarred walls. One can almost hear the clang of swords, the pitiful bleating of whatever poor beast was dragged kicking and screaming into the spotlight, the thunderous applause for a well-placed spear thrust. Of course, one also probably hears the modern tourist snapping selfies and complaining about the price of gelato, which, if I may be so bold, is a tragedy in its own right. But still, the bones of history are there, whispering tales of emperors gone mad, of bravery and barbarity, of a civilization that thought bathing together was a sign of progress, right before it all went pear-shaped. It’s a sobering thought, really, standing there amidst the ruins, realizing that even the grandest empires, the ones with the biggest amphitheaters and the fanciest togas, eventually end up as nothing more than a pile of rocks for tourists to gawk at. Makes you wonder if our own civilization will be remembered for its contributions to literature or our mastery of the selfie stick. My money's on the latter, alas.
