Zermatt, you say? Ah, a pretty enough village, nestled beneath that Matterhorn fellow, which, I confess, does look rather like a colossal, jagged tooth about to give the heavens a nip. One arrives, naturally, expecting a charming little haven of tranquility, perhaps a cow bell orchestra and a yodeler or two. And in truth, there *are* cows. And bells. But tranquility? Bless your heart. The streets teem with folk from every corner of the globe, all jostling for space to admire the mountain, and each other's suspiciously shiny ski outfits. They come armed with cameras the size of small children, snapping away as if the Matterhorn might vanish if left unphotographed for five minutes. One can hardly blame them, I suppose; it’s a sight, certainly. Though I daresay a good engraving would serve just as well and save considerable wear and tear on one's feet, not to mention the sanity. 

The main street, they call it the Bahnhofstrasse, is a veritable gauntlet of shops selling watches that cost more than a small house, chocolate that induces a state of delirious happiness (and subsequent regret), and enough fur-trimmed garments to clothe the entire population of Alaska. One wonders, indeed, how many marmots had to meet their untimely end to satisfy the Zermatt fur trade. The food, mind you, is quite palatable, though rather heavy on the cheese. I suspect the local cheese-makers have a secret pact with the mountain, ensuring a steady supply of clientele seeking comfort after a day spent braving the icy slopes. As for the Matterhorn, well, it just stands there, majestic and indifferent, observing the human ants scurrying about its base, quite likely wondering what all the fuss is about. A grand old spectacle it is, no doubt, but I confess, after a day of dodging selfie sticks and resisting the siren song of exorbitantly priced cuckoo clocks, I found myself rather longing for a good cup of tea and a quiet conversation with a sensible mule.
