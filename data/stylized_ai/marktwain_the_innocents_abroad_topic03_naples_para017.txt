Naples, ah, Naples! A city so brimming with life – and the rather fragrant aroma of yesterday’s refuse – that one scarcely knows where to begin. It's a place where the centuries seem to have thrown a grand masquerade ball, each jostling for position and demanding to be seen. You'll find grand palazzos crumbling at the edges, like old dowagers clinging to faded finery, whispering tales of past glories to the persistent sea breeze. And then, a mere cobblestone toss away, a gaggle of urchins schemes and haggles over pilfered oranges, their laughter echoing through the narrow, winding streets as if they own the place outright, which, in a manner of speaking, they probably do. The Neapolitans themselves are a curious lot, a volatile mixture of piety and roguery, operatic in their affections and quick to burst into song, especially if a lira or two might be involved. One moment, they are passionately arguing about the merits of rival pizza makers (a debate, mind you, as serious as any theological dispute), and the next, they're offering you a generous slice of their grandmother’s prized sfogliatella, even if they suspect you might be a pickpocket in disguise. The traffic, I must confess, is a sight to behold. Carriages, carts, and contrivances that vaguely resemble automobiles career through the streets with reckless abandon, seemingly guided by nothing more than divine providence and the fervent honking of horns. It is a chaotic ballet, a symphony of near misses, and a testament to the remarkable elasticity of the human form, for one is quite certain to be grazed by at least a half-dozen vehicles before reaching the other side. And yet, amidst all the commotion and the clamor, there's a certain undeniable charm, a raw, untamed vitality that clings to the very air, a quality that makes one forgive Naples its imperfections, its dust, and its delightful, albeit occasionally overwhelming, eccentricities. You see, Naples isn't just a city, it's a spectacle, a performance, a glorious, slightly mad, and utterly unforgettable opera being played out on the world’s stage, and I, for one, wouldn't miss it for all the figs in Sicily.
