Higbie, now there's a name that could curdle milk, but the man behind it wasn't so bad, least not in the daylight hours. A claim jumper, some said, others reckoned him a misplaced saint with a pickaxe. I never could tell which was closer to the truth, but he had a beard that could hide a family of squirrels and a way of talking that’d make you think he knew secrets the angels themselves were itching to get their wings on. Claimed he knew the Comstock better than his own mother, which was saying something, seeing as his mother, bless her departed soul, was said to have the topographical map of the entire state etched on her backside, courtesy of a runaway wagon.

He was a feller who could smell silver ore from a mile away, or so he claimed. Fact is, I suspect he just had a talent for being where the silver happened to be, a talent many a prospector would sell their grandpappy's boots for. He always had some new "sure thing" percolatin' in his brain, plans grander than the Governor's mansion, though often about as grounded in reality as a hummingbird in a hailstorm. He’d be all fired up for a day, draw you maps on the dirt floor of the saloon with a burnt stick, promisin' riches beyond your wildest dreams. And then, come the next mornin', he’d be off chasing some other fool's rainbow, leaving you with a backache and a map that looked suspiciously like chicken scratch.

But he was honest enough, in his own peculiar way. He’d tell you straight out that he was out for himself, and if you happened to benefit along the way, well, that was just gravy. And Lord knows, in a land as full of cutthroats and swindlers as Nevada, that kind of straightforward deviltry was almost refreshing. He was a scoundrel, no doubt, but a scoundrel with a twinkle in his eye and a tall tale on his tongue, and in this neck of the woods, that made him as good a companion as you were likely to find this side of the Missouri.
