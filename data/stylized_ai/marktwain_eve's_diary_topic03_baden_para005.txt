Baden-Baden, they call it. Baden-Baden, twice as good, I suppose, as plain old Baden, like repeating a name to make a dullard understand. And understand they do, the dullards, for Baden-Baden is where they gather, these bejeweled, perfumed, and upholstered specimens of leisure. It's a sort of gilded cage where they preen and flutter about, convinced their feathers are finer than any other bird's. One can scarcely take a stroll without being jostled by a duchess whose diamonds could sink a battleship (if battleships were still sunk, that is, and not just obsolete ironclad reminders of poor investment). The waters, they claim, are a miracle. Miracle, I say! A miracle if they could wash away the ennui clinging to these languid creatures like a persistent fog. They soak and simmer, these wealthy wretches, hoping to find a cure for boredom in a tub, as if the remedy wasn't a bit of honest work and a good conscience. The conversation, mind you, is even more tepid than the baths. One hears endless prattle about fortunes, fashions, and the frightful expense of having nothing whatsoever to occupy one’s brain. The Kursaal, a temple of chance and folly, stands gleaming, beckoning them to throw away fortunes on the turn of a card, as if losing it all would be more thrilling than actually earning something in the first place. And the food! Oh, the food! Elaborate creations designed not for nourishment, but for sheer ostentation. Each plate a miniature masterpiece, too beautiful to eat, but of course, they eat it all, these delicate souls, then complain about indigestion and retire to their opulent beds for another dose of manufactured dreams. Yes, Baden-Baden is quite the spectacle, a human zoo where the creatures are remarkably well-fed, exceptionally bored, and utterly devoid of anything resembling genuine contentment.
