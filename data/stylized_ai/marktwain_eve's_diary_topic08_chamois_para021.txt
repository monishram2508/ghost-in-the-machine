The Chamois, bless their woolly little hearts! A creature so singularly inclined to acrobatic feats of mountain goatishness, that one might suspect they'd been hired by the Almighty to keep the scenery interesting. Imagine, if you will, a smallish deer, perhaps the size of a well-fed terrier, but possessed of a springiness in its legs that would put a grasshopper to shame. Now, instead of the polite, demure browsing of your average deer, these fellas are all about leaping and scrambling up cliffs like they’re late for supper with the Devil. And as for their attire, well, it's a utilitarian sort of affair. A coat of brown that shifts with the seasons, blending into the rocks and snow with an admirable lack of ostentation – unlike some creatures I could name, *cough* peacocks *cough*. Their horns are modest, little hooks of black, just enough to give them a touch of rakish charm, and perhaps dissuade any overly zealous eagles. I've watched them for hours, you know, through a borrowed spyglass of dubious quality. They seem to have a profound lack of fear, or perhaps an overabundance of foolishness, I can’t quite decide which. They'll stand poised on a ledge so narrow it would make a tightrope walker weep with envy, gazing out at the world with an air of detached superiority, as if to say, "Oh, this old thing? Just a regular Tuesday for me." And then, with a flick of their absurdly short tail, they'll bound off into the abyss, landing, miraculously, on another ledge even more precarious than the last. It makes a body wonder if they possess a secret understanding with gravity, a sort of gentleman's agreement to ignore the usual rules of physics. One might speculate they are privy to some grand divine joke on the rest of creation, and are simply attempting to make God laugh. Or perhaps they simply never learned to be careful. Either way, they're a constant reminder that even in the harshest landscapes, there's always room for a bit of playful impertinence.
