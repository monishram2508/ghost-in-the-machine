Higbie, now there was a specimen, a regular curiosity of the Sierra Nevada. You’d find him knocking about Virginia City, looking for all the world like a prospector who’d struck a vein of solid disappointment. Hair like a tumbleweed caught in a barbed wire fence, eyes that held the glint of fool’s gold, and a voice gravelly enough to pave a road with. He was a man perpetually burdened by grand schemes and a lighter wallet than a preacher's conscience after a poker game. Said he was going to invent a self-milking cow, but last I saw him, he was still trying to figure out how to keep the darn thing from kicking.

Higbie, he was a talker, that’s for sure. Could spin a yarn longer than the Comstock Lode, full of adventures that were likely hatched from a bottle of rotgut whiskey and a particularly vivid dream. He'd tell you about his gold mine "just over yonder, behind the next ridge," where nuggets grew on trees and the dirt was practically pure gold. Of course, “over yonder” was always suspiciously far and no one ever did see that particular patch of gilded flora.

I reckon Higbie had a heart of gold, though, underneath all that bluster and those tall tales. He'd share his last piece of hardtack with a stranger and offer a hand to anyone down on their luck, even if he was usually one step away from being in the same predicament himself. He was a likeable rascal, that Higbie, a reminder that the West was full of dreamers, schemers, and enough characters to fill a library of dime novels. And while his riches might have been confined to the imagination, he possessed the true wealth of the frontier: an unshakeable optimism and the ability to laugh in the face of downright, mule-headed misfortune. The man was a walking, talking gold mine of tall tales, and in these parts, that was a valuable commodity indeed.
