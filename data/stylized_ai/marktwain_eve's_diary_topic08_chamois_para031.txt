And then there was the matter of the chamois, bless their woolly little souls, or rather, their distinctly non-woolly, but surprisingly athletic souls. Now, these creatures, they're not like your common garden-variety goat, mind you. They wouldn't dream of nibbling at a Mrs. McGillicuddy's prize-winning petunias. Oh no, they're far too busy performing feats of acrobatic derring-do upon the most precipitous slopes imaginable. One wonders if they have an understanding with gravity, a gentleman's agreement, perhaps, wherein gravity politely looks the other way while the chamois executes a particularly audacious leap across a chasm that would give a seasoned mountain goat palpitations.

I confess, I observed one such specimen, clinging to a near-vertical cliff face, with naught but a few scraggly patches of grass for purchase, and couldn't help but feel a certain kinship. There I was, perched precariously on a mule that seemed determined to test the limits of both physics and my patience, while this chamois was making a mockery of the very notion of "difficult terrain." It gave a body pause, I tell you. Made me question the wisdom of relying on a beast that seemed to have a personal vendetta against forward motion, when I could perhaps, with a little practice and a generous application of sticky glue, emulate the chamois' graceful, if slightly mad, rock-climbing prowess. Of course, then I remembered my distinctly non-chamois-like build, and the distinct lack of grass-eating habits and decided to stay put. Still, one can't help but admire the sheer audacity of a creature that treats a mountain range like its personal playground. They're like little, brown, four-legged daredevils, thumbing their noses at the laws of nature and probably chuckling amongst themselves at the expense of us clumsy, earthbound humans. One is almost tempted to send them a strongly worded letter of complaint, but then again, who am I to begrudge them their fun, especially when I’m the one stuck on this darned mule?
