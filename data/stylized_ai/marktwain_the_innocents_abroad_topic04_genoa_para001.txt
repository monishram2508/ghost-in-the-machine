Genoa, you see, is one of those places that clings to the hillside like a barnacle to a rotting ship, only instead of rotting, this particular ship has been gathering barnacles – and peeling paint – for a good two thousand years, or so they’d have you believe. I suspect the truth is far more interesting than any dusty history book would suggest, if only because I saw a cat wearing a miniature admiral's hat sauntering through the Via Garibaldi. Now, I’ve seen sights in my time, mind you, but a feline in epaulettes is enough to make one question the very fabric of reality, and possibly the strength of the local grappa.

The streets themselves are a marvel, not of architectural design, mind you, but of confounding navigation. They twist and turn like a politician trying to avoid a straight answer, often leading you back to the very spot you started from, which is perhaps a subtle commentary on the futility of human endeavor. Sunlight, you’ll find, is a rare and precious commodity in those narrow alleys; I imagine the local merchants must sell it in small vials to tourists like myself, judging by the prices I’ve been charged for a simple cup of coffee. The harbor, ah, the harbor! It’s a riot of color and cacophony, a swirling stew of fishing boats, grand yachts, and enough seagulls to stage a Shakespearean tragedy. I watched one particularly audacious gull snatch a panini right out of a fellow’s hand, proving once and for all that some birds have a keener sense of culinary appreciation than some humans. The Genovese, they’re a curious breed, taciturn and shrewd, their faces etched with the kind of wisdom (or perhaps weariness) that comes from centuries of haggling and navigating these labyrinthine streets. They eye you up with a look that suggests they know exactly how much money you have, and precisely how they intend to relieve you of it. Still, there's a certain charm to their frugality, a practical sort of honesty that you won't find gilded with false smiles and flowery compliments like those Frenchmen down the coast. I suppose one must admire a people who value a good lira over a fancy flourish, even if it leaves a fellow feeling slightly lighter in the pocket.
