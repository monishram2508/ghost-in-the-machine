Harris, now there was a fellow. Not a man you’d pin any hopes on of single-handedly building the pyramids, mind you, but a fella you could rely on to accidentally set fire to his trousers while trying to boil water for tea. I recall once, we were floating down the Thames, a most leisurely affair it was, all sunshine and idle chatter, until Harris took it into his head to brew up a cup. He'd acquired some newfangled contraption, a spirit stove he called it, guaranteed to heat water faster than a dog chasing a cat. Well, "faster" it was, if one counted the speed at which the flames leaped from the poorly-fitted valve and commenced to nibble at his tweed breeches. He yelped, naturally, a sound not unlike a distressed piglet, and proceeded to flail about the boat, scattering tea leaves and biscuits with the abandon of a drunken farmer sowing wheat. The water, of course, never boiled.

He blamed the stove, naturally. Never himself. “Damned contraption!” he exclaimed, beating at the embers clinging to his leg with a damp dishcloth. "Infernal, modern infernalism! Back in my day, we built a proper fire, like men! Not this… this… flamin’ devil’s belch!” It took the combined efforts of myself and young George to extinguish the blaze, and even then, the aroma of singed wool and slightly roasted Harris lingered for the remainder of the afternoon. Later, as the sun dipped low and painted the river gold, Harris, clad in a borrowed blanket and looking profoundly disgruntled, declared that he'd learned a valuable lesson: never trust a machine that looks like it was designed by a committee of goblins. He then promptly tripped over a mooring rope and tumbled headfirst into a patch of nettles. Harris, I tell you, was a walking, talking illustration of Murphy's Law, a testament to the enduring power of misfortune to find even the most well-intentioned soul.
