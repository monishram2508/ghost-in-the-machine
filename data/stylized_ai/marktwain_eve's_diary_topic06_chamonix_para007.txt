Chamonix, ah, Chamonix! A place where men voluntarily strap planks to their feet and hurl themselves down mountains, a pastime that strikes me as considerably less sensible than attempting to teach a cat to yodel. I confess, I witnessed this spectacle with a mixture of horror and morbid fascination, like observing a squirrel attempting to cross a railway track, convinced that surely, nature will intervene before utter calamity ensues. The town itself, huddled beneath Mont Blanc like a nervous peasant before a particularly imposing monarch, is overrun with shops peddling brightly colored garments and contraptions of questionable utility. One might think the inhabitants perpetually prepare for an Arctic expedition, judging by the sheer volume of thermal underwear on display. I even saw a pair of goggles, apparently designed to filter out the sheer audacity of the prices. The air, however, is undeniably invigorating, a crisp, clean sort of air that one rarely encounters in cities where coal smoke and societal hypocrisy contend for dominance. And the mountains! Bless me, those mountains! They loom, they glare, they practically shout their immensity at you, daring you to challenge their reign. Naturally, I declined. My own constitution, I find, is better suited to a comfortable armchair and a well-bound book than wrestling with avalanches and recalcitrant glaciers. The locals, a hardy bunch, seem unfazed by the whole affair, scaling these icy giants with the casual air of one popping out for a pint of milk. I suspect they are either remarkably brave or remarkably short-sighted. Or perhaps, they have simply become accustomed to the peculiar brand of madness that permeates the thin mountain air. In any case, I found it a delightful place to observe human folly at its finest, albeit from a safe and comfortably heated distance. After all, what’s the point of admiring the view if you can’t do so with a cup of tea and the distinct feeling of smug superiority?
