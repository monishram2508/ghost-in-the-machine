Now, miners, there's a breed. Not the parlor-room sort, mind you, nor them fancy fellows with the silk handkerchiefs and surveying tools, but the real McCoy. The ones that wrestle the earth like it owes 'em money and ain't afraid to get a little dirty in the transaction. You could spot 'em a mile off: covered head-to-toe in dust so fine it'd seep into your marrow, carrying picks and shovels like extensions of their own limbs, faces etched with the constant squint from staring into the dim, smoky depths. They were a rum bunch, I tell you, superstitious as old maids and twice as stubborn. Each one had a claim, or dreamt of one, richer than Croesus's sock drawer. Some swore by divining rods made of willow, others by the twitch in their left knee, and still others, the most desperate, by the pronouncements of Mrs. O'Flaherty, who claimed to talk to the earthworms. 

There was a fella named "Lucky" Larson who was, in fact, the unluckiest cuss I ever met. He’d find gold alright, just enough to get excited, then a cave-in, a flash flood, or a swarm of particularly aggressive badger would come along and swallow it whole. He kept at it though, ever optimistic, claiming his luck was just resting, gathering its strength for the big strike. And then there was old man Hemlock, who was convinced the Comstock Lode ran right under his outhouse, and spent the better part of a year excavating the poor thing. Never found gold, but I reckon he did discover some interesting anthropological artifacts, if you catch my drift. Miners, they were a peculiar lot, driven by the glint of yellow metal and sustained by coffee strong enough to peel paint, but beneath the grime and grit, they were the very backbone of this country, or at least the pickaxe doing the chiropracty work on it.
