Genoa, bless her heart, is a city built, one imagines, by a committee of drunken mountain goats, each with a personal vendetta against right angles and level surfaces. You see, the place is perpetually either climbing straight up or plummeting straight down, the streets a labyrinthine affair that would give Theseus a fit of the vapors. One minute you're gazing upon the sea, a shimmering expanse of Mediterranean blue, the next you're wedged between buildings so tall and narrow you half expect to brush elbows with the occupants of the seventh floor whilst strolling on the pavement. A fellow could get dizzy just trying to find a decent pasticceria, I assure you.

The architecture, mind you, is quite impressive, if a tad gloomy. Grand palazzi, built by merchants richer than Croesus and doubtless just as shrewd, loom over you, whispering tales of daring sea voyages and fortunes made and lost in the blink of an eye. Of course, a good scrubbing wouldn't hurt; centuries of salt air and the general grubbiness of a port city have given them a rather somber complexion, like aging dowagers who've seen a bit too much of the world's wickedness. And the washing! Why, it's strung across every conceivable space, flapping in the breeze like so many flags of surrender to the forces of domesticity. One wonders if the Genoese ever sleep, or if they simply exist in a perpetual state of laundering.

The harbor, ah, that's a different story altogether. Bustling, chaotic, and teeming with life, it's a proper spectacle. Sailors from every corner of the globe jostle with hawkers and hucksters, all vying for your attention and your lira. The air is thick with the scent of salt, fish, and something vaguely…unidentifiable. One can acquire anything there, from a smuggled parrot to a questionable antique, provided one is willing to haggle with the tenacity of a starving terrier. And the seagulls! Lord, the seagulls! They're bolder than bandits, swooping down to pilfer your lunch with an audacity that's both infuriating and strangely admirable. Genoa, you see, is a city of contradictions, a place where beauty and grime, wealth and poverty, jostle each other like passengers on a crowded tram. It's a bit of a mess, to be sure, but a fascinating one nonetheless.
