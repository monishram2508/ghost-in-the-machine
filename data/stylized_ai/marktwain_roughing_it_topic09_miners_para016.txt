Now, these miners, you see, they were a breed apart, a peculiar bunch that you wouldn’t find nowhere else on this blasted earth. Each one thought he held the golden key to Fortunatus’ purse, and they'd back it up with more bluster than a Fourth of July parade. There was old man Hemlock, convinced his divining rod – a forked willow branch that more resembled a crippled wishbone – could sniff out gold faster than a bloodhound sniffs out a ham sandwich. He'd wander around mumbling to it like it was his prize-winning rooster, all the while stubbing his toes and complaining about the “auric emanations” messing with his arthritis. Then you had "Calamity" Jane's brother, a feller we just called him 'Three-Fingered Pete' – seemed he’d misplaced a couple digits in a dynamite mishap. He figured if a little blast unearthed a pebble, a big blast would unearth a mountain of gold. Course, all it mostly unearthed was more dirt and a healthy dose of tinnitus for everyone within a mile. 

And Lord Almighty, did they argue! Debates over the best claim, the richest vein, the most scientific way to pan – it was a regular intellectual free-for-all. You'd hear claims like, "The gold runs north, I tell ya! Follows the magnetic pull of the polar star!", followed by someone yelling that gold had no more sense of direction than a drunk hummingbird. Then they’d get to drinking and it’d turn into talk about politics and that was just bad. But, despite all the nonsense, there was a kind of...well, *something* respectable about them. They were hard-working and tougher than jerky, and more stubbornly hopeful than an atheist praying for rain. They had a dream, even if it was built on delusions, and weren’t afraid to get their hands dirty chasing it. Which, in this world, might be the most valuable nugget of all.
