Now, Morgan, there was a specimen. A fella built like a sawed-off oak stump, and twice as ornery. Claimed he’d wrestled grizzlies for breakfast, which I reckon might be true, seein' as how he had the scars to prove *somethin’*. He drifted into Virginia City lookin' like a tumbleweed with a grudge, all dust and squint and a permanent air of suspicion pointed at anything wearin' pants. Said he was a prospector, but I figured him more for a professional avoid-work-er, if such a trade existed. Always had a yarn or two a-brewin’, the kind that smelled suspiciously of whiskey and exaggeration. One time he swore he’d found a vein of pure silver, so rich it practically vibrated, but then a band of Paiute Indians stole it all while he was nappin’ in the shade. Course, nobody ever actually *saw* this silver, nor the Paiutes, which led some folks to think Morgan’s imagination was richer than any mine ever dug. He spent most of his days leaning against the Crystal Palace Saloon, drinkin’ rye whiskey and offerin’ free advice on everything from stock market speculation to the proper way to train a mule. Nobody ever took his advice, mind you, but he offered it with such unwavering confidence, you almost started believin’ him. He had a laugh like a rusty hinge, and a cough that could shake the paint off a wall, and a heart, I suspect, that was made of somethin’ akin to hardened Nevada granite. Still, he was a colorful sort, and Virginia City needed colorful sorts like a sourdough needed yeast. He vanished one day just as sudden as he appeared, leavin’ behind nothin’ but a faint whiff of cheap tobacco and a lingering collection of tall tales, the kind that’d grow taller with each passin’ year, until nobody could rightly remember if Morgan was a man, or just a particularly stubborn legend. And I ain’t sure which one he'd rather be.
