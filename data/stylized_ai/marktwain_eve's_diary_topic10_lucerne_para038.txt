Lucerne, ah, Lucerne! A tidy little town it is, squeezed betwixt that impossibly blue lake and those preposterously jagged Alps, like a prim spinster tucked into a fancy lace shawl and bonnet. One half expects it to sneeze at any moment, though not, I hasten to add, from any rudeness on the part of the visitor. No, Lucerne keeps itself to itself, thank you very much. The tourists, bless their cotton socks, flock through in droves, gobbling up picture postcards of the Lion Monument, that melancholic beast carved into the rock, looking for all the world like he's just remembered he left the stove on. And who can blame him? Even stone lions have their moments of domestic anxiety, I daresay. The locals, bless their practical souls, tolerate the spectacle with the weary patience of a man who's just finished milking a particularly stubborn cow. They know the tourists will be gone by teatime, replaced by a fresh wave of them the next morning, all clamoring for chocolate and cuckoo clocks. The lake itself, well, it's the color of forget-me-nots dipped in sunshine, and so placid you could practically skip a stone across it all the way to Italy, if you had the arm for it, and a stone flat enough. And the bridges! Covered in paintings, mostly depicting the Dance of Death, which, considering the price of cheese and chocolate, seems a tad redundant. One hardly needs a ghastly reminder of mortality when the cost of living is already doing a perfectly adequate job. I suppose it's all meant to be very improving, but I confess I spent most of my time trying to figure out how the painter managed to make Death look so remarkably bored. It's a skill, truly. All in all, Lucerne is a charming spot, if a bit… well, proper. One feels a distinct urge to straighten one's collar and speak in hushed tones, lest one offend the delicate sensibilities of the place. It lacks a certain… rowdiness, perhaps. But then, I suspect the Swiss prefer their rowdiness to occur in private, preferably involving yodeling and copious amounts of fondue.
