Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, emerged in the United States in the 19th century, founded by Joseph Smith. Central to its doctrine is the belief in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, which Smith claimed to have translated from golden plates revealed to him by an angel named Moroni. This book narrates the story of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection, offering a unique and distinct perspective on Christian history. Mormons view the Book of Mormon as a companion scripture to the Bible, providing further witness of Jesus Christ and clarifying certain doctrines. Smith's teachings also introduced the concept of continuous revelation, meaning God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets, with the church president considered the current prophet. Early Mormon history was marked by significant persecution and forced migration, culminating in the trek westward to establish a community in Utah under the leadership of Brigham Young. Salt Lake City became the church's headquarters and remains so today.

Mormon theology emphasizes the importance of family, eternal progression, and temple worship. The concept of the pre-mortal existence, where souls lived with God before birth, is a key element. Temple rituals, considered sacred and confidential, are performed for the living and the dead, including sealings, which are believed to bind families together eternally. Missionary work is a defining characteristic of Mormonism, with young men and women often serving voluntarily for two years to proselytize and spread the church's message worldwide. The church also places a strong emphasis on community involvement, charitable work, and adherence to a strict moral code, often referred to as the Word of Wisdom, which encourages abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. Over time, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has evolved and adapted, while maintaining its core beliefs and values. Today, it is a global religion with millions of members spanning numerous countries and cultures, playing a significant role in various aspects of society, from humanitarian aid to cultural preservation.
