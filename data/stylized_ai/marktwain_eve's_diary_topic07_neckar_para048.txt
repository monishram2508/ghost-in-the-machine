The Neckar, bless its watery heart, is not what you'd call a river with ambitions of grandeur, like that Mississippi fellow, always showing off with its breadth and its muddy pronouncements. No, the Neckar is a more…domestic affair, a good German housewife amongst rivers, content to meander through the countryside with a purpose, though not an overly frantic one, mind you. It’s ever so picturesque, I must admit, especially when viewed from a vine-draped terrace, preferably with a glass of something local that makes your nose crinkle in a pleasing sort of way. You see castles perched upon the hillsides, old fellows they are, brooding over the river as if daring it to flood their cellars, which, to be fair, it probably does every now and then.

The villages that nestle along its banks are just as charmingly stubborn, built as if time forgot them altogether, or perhaps gave them a kindly wink and told them to carry on as they were. You’ll find burghers sitting outside their half-timbered houses, puffing on pipes that smell suspiciously of licorice and watching the river go by with an air of contented inevitability. I’ve tried to discern their thoughts, but mostly, I suspect, they’re contemplating the price of sausages and the proper way to prune a grape vine. The boats that ply the Neckar are mostly of the pleasure variety, filled with tourists snapping pictures as if they'd never seen a river before, and students singing drinking songs with a boisterousness that puts the local storks to flight. One cannot blame the storks, naturally. Even the Neckar, in its gentle, unassuming way, seems to tolerate the revelry with a long-suffering sigh, a sort of “Oh, these humans, aren’t they amusing?” attitude. It’s a river for poets, I’d say, or for anyone who appreciates a bit of quiet contemplation punctuated by the occasional clinking of beer steins. Just don't expect any thrilling adventures or daring exploits; the Neckar is more about tranquility than tempest.
