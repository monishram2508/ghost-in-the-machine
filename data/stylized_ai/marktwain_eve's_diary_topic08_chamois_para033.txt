Well, I do declare, the chamois is an animal that certainly stirs one's curiosity, and not always in the most flattering way, I confess. They're related to the goat, you see, but don't let that give you ideas of docile milkmaids. These creatures are the mountain bandits of the Alps, and Pyrenees, prancing about on cliffs where a sensible goat wouldn't dare to tread. I encountered one once, or perhaps it encountered me, whilst attempting a pleasant stroll through a particularly scenic, and precipitous, Swiss valley. There I was, humming a jaunty tune and admiring the view, when a dark shadow zipped across my path with an impish grin only a chamois could possess.

It paused only to flick its absurd little tail at me, a gesture that I interpreted as a deliberate insult, before disappearing up a rock face that looked like it had been designed by a drunken architect. Such agility! One can't help but marvel at the engineering of their limbs, built for precarious living. You might think they lead a solemn life, being surrounded by peaks that touch the heavens, and one might expect a sort of humble quiet from them, but no. They're rowdy rascals, always arguing over a patch of lichen, or showing off their leaps to impress the ladies. The ladies, mind you, are just as cheeky. They'll give you a look that suggests you're entirely in the way and then promptly trip you as they frolic away. And those horns! Not the grand, imposing affairs of an ox, but rather like a pair of question marks worn jauntily on their heads, as if constantly pondering some deep, philosophical riddle, such as "How can I steal that tourist's sandwich?". One can't help but begrudgingly admire their tenacity, and their sheer audacity, even as one shakes one's fist at their swiftly disappearing hindquarters. They're the scoundrels of the mountains, these chamois, and I suspect, in their own way, they wouldn't have it any other way.
