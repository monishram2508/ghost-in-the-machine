Zermatt, you say? A village perched beneath the Matterhorn like a flea on a dog’s back, only prettier, and considerably less scratchy, I presume. Why, it’s a place so determined to cling to its pre-industrial virtue that they’ve banished the infernal combustion engine altogether! Imagine, a Swiss town where the loudest noise isn’t the clatter of some Daimler’s devilish contraption, but the gentle clopping of horse-drawn carriages and the occasional yodel gone astray. It’s enough to make a man nostalgic for a time he never knew, even if that time probably involved more toothaches and less indoor plumbing.

The tourists, of course, are thicker than flies on a treacle tart, all bundled up in their furs and looking like so many well-fed caterpillars. They come to gawk at the Matterhorn, a geological marvel that’s been posing for snapshots for centuries. I watched one chap, face red as a boiled lobster, nearly fall headfirst into a snowdrift while trying to capture its majestic, if somewhat pointy, splendor. Serves him right, I thought. Such an egregious display of reverence toward inanimate rock seemed… excessive.

And the skiing! Why, they fling themselves down those mountainsides with the abandon of lemmings heading for the sea. They call it "sport," but it looks suspiciously like an elaborate form of self-inflicted injury. I wouldn't dare to partake. I am too aware of my own mortality, you see. I much preferred to sit on a sunny veranda with a glass of something amber and potent, observing the spectacle. It is much safer and far more entertaining, I assure you. The Alps are lovely, truly, but they’re best appreciated from a safe distance, preferably with a fine cigar and the comforting knowledge that gravity is working on someone else for a change. Zermatt, then, is a curious concoction of rustic charm and rampant tourism, a stage set for the wealthy to play at being rugged, and a most diverting place to witness it all.
