Naples, ah, Naples! A city so charmingly dilapidated, it makes one suspect its inhabitants are in a conspiracy to keep it from accidentally improving. I dare say, Pompeii, lying dead and buried under Vesuvius, is in better repair. Cobblestone streets, worn smoother than a politician's promises, wind this way and that, a labyrinth designed, I suspect, by a drunken goat. One half expects to see Romulus and Remus nipping at your heels, only to discover it's merely a gaggle of street urchins, their eyes gleaming with the shrewdness of veteran cardsharps, eager to relieve you of your spare change before you can say "Vesuvius eruptus!"

And the Neapolitans themselves! A breed apart, they are, noisy as a convention of geese and passionate as a tenor hitting a high C. They gesticulate with the fervor of semaphore operators, their voices rising and falling like the waves of the Bay of Naples. They’ll argue the merits of one pizza parlor over another with the conviction of theologians debating the existence of angels, each gesture seemingly threatening to knock over a precarious tower of luggage balancing on a passing donkey. As for the famed artistry of the city, one finds it not so much in galleries of paintings as in the casual grace with which a vendor hawks lemons from a cart, or the theatrical lamentations of a widow airing her grief, and her laundry, from a balcony. Mind you, one never knows if the grief is genuine or simply a clever marketing ploy to gain a sympathetic ear. Still, the opera of life is performed here with a gusto rarely seen outside a melodrama, and even if one doesn't understand the language, one certainly understands the emotions. I suspect even Saint Peter, standing guard at the pearly gates, might be inclined to let a Neapolitan or two slip through, simply for the sheer entertainment value they would bring to the heavenly host.
