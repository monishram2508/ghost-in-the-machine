Carson City, you see, is a place that could inspire a man to verse, or more likely, drive him to drinkin'. A town laid out square as a billiard table, though not nearly as lively, mind you. They say it's the capital of Nevada, but truth be told, a tumbleweed with a government grant could likely run the whole shebang. The buildings mostly resembled glorified outhouses, only with fancier shingles and a distinct lack of the pungent aroma that often accompanied the humbler establishment. I recollect one feller tellin' me the courthouse was built of sandstone, quarried right outside town. He said it was supposed to signify strength and endurance. I reckon it signifies how lazy they were to haul stone any further.

The saloons, now, those were somethin' else. Oases of dust and discontent, each one promisin' salvation in a glass. The bartenders, grizzled veterans of some long-forgotten claim jumpin' expedition, poured whiskey strong enough to pickle a rattlesnake. And the characters that frequented 'em! Miners smellin' of gunpowder and desperation, card sharps with eyes that could read the back of a deck a mile away, and dance hall girls whose painted smiles belied the weariness of the ages. They all huddled together, seekin' a moment's respite from the harsh realities of the desert and the even harsher realities of their own choices. You could find a feller gamblin' away his life savings on the turn of a card, then cryin' into his whiskey about how unjust the world was. As if the cards themselves had forced him to play. It was a sight to behold, I tell you. A tragicomedy played out nightly, with whiskey as the backdrop and heartbreak as the punchline. And me? Well, I was just an observer, notebook in hand, tryin' to make sense of it all, hopin' to find a story amidst the dust and the dreams gone bust. Perhaps, even, a touch of gold.
