Well, Adam do declare if ever there was a creature built for showing off to the ladies, it’s this chamois fellow. A goat-antelope, mind you, a phrase that sounds like the result of some drunken experiment in the Garden, a hybrid born of sheer boredom, perhaps. They prance around up there in the Alps, those jagged, dizzying heights, like they own the whole place, which, come to think of it, they probably do. Nobody else in their right mind would want it. They've got these little hooked horns, rather rakishly angled, and a coat that changes color depending on the season, like a woman trying to decide what to wear to the dance. Clever, that. Gives them a leg up in the deception department. Camouflage, they call it. I call it vanity, pure and simple.

And oh, the agility! They bound up those cliffs like they're defying gravity itself, leaping across chasms that’d make a seasoned angel think twice. One moment they're a speck on a rocky outcrop, the next they're a blur of brown fur, seemingly suspended in mid-air. It's enough to make a girl feel quite inadequate, I tell you. Though, frankly, I suspect half of it is just showing off for the benefit of the other chamois. You know how boys are. Always posturing and preening, trying to outdo one another. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn they have little chamois clubs where they trade boasts and compare their jump heights, fuelled by the finest mountain herbs, no doubt. I wouldn't even bet against it. And the smell, my word, they tell me it is quite something to the men, the pheromones flowing wild in the mating season. I will take their word on that, as you will not find me scaling any cliffs to smell what the wind has blew in. Likely I’ll stay down here among the daisies, smelling of apples.
