Winter, bless its frosted whiskers, is a season best viewed from a distance, preferably from inside a saloon with a roaring fire and a bottle of something that sings a sweet song of forgetting. Out here in Nevada, winter ain’t the dainty, poetic thing you read about in those Eastern magazines. No sir, it’s a brute, a curmudgeon with a heart colder than a banker’s smile and a temperament as predictable as a rattlesnake in a sunbeam. One day, the sky’s the color of robin’s egg and the sun’s winking at you like a friendly drunk, and the next, she’s dumping snow like a busted flour sack, burying everything from sagebrush to stray dogs under a white blanket of misery.

You’d think after all this time, folks would learn to respect the old blizzard, but no, they still try to outsmart her. I seen prospectors, stubborn as mules, setting out for the hills in January, dreaming of gold and wearing nothing but a thin coat and a prayer. Come February, you’d be lucky to find their bones, let alone their gold. They become just another cautionary tale whispered around the pot-bellied stove, a reminder that nature ain’t got no patience for foolishness. And the animals! The coyotes sound like they're auditioning for a ghost opera, their howls carrying on the wind like the mournful cry of a lovesick widow. And the squirrels? Well, they just disappear, probably hibernating somewhere underground, laughing at the rest of us suckers who have to shovel snow and fight frostbite.

The only good thing about winter, if you can call it that, is that it makes you appreciate the summer all the more. When the snow finally melts and the wildflowers start popping up like a miner’s hopes, you almost forget the frozen misery you endured. Almost. But then you remember the icicles hanging from your nose, the wind that cuts through you like a dull saw, and the endless shoveling, and you realize that maybe, just maybe, there's a good reason why some folks decide to spend their winters in San Francisco. Now, there's an idea worth pondering over a whiskey or two.
