The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, emerged in the United States during the 19th century, founded by Joseph Smith. A key tenet of their faith is the belief in continuing revelation, meaning that God continues to communicate with humanity beyond the Bible. This belief led to the creation of the Book of Mormon, which Mormons consider a companion scripture to the Bible, containing a narrative of ancient inhabitants of the Americas and their interactions with Jesus Christ. Early members faced significant persecution due to their beliefs, particularly their practice of polygamy, which was officially discontinued in 1890. This persecution led to a westward migration, culminating in the establishment of Salt Lake City, Utah, as their headquarters.

The Mormon faith encompasses a unique theology, including the belief in a premortal existence, a multi-tiered afterlife, and the potential for exaltation, which involves becoming like God. Family is central to Mormon belief and practice, emphasized through activities like Family Home Evening and a focus on temple ordinances believed to bind families together eternally. Missionary work is another defining characteristic of the Church, with young men and women often serving voluntary missions abroad for 18-24 months, sharing their beliefs and engaging in humanitarian efforts. Mormons adhere to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which encourages abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, and harmful drugs, emphasizing physical and spiritual well-being. The Church operates a vast network of welfare programs, providing assistance to members in need and contributing to disaster relief efforts globally. While the Church has evolved over time, its core beliefs remain centered on Jesus Christ, personal revelation, and a commitment to building the Kingdom of God on Earth.
