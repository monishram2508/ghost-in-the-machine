Zermatt, they call it. A village nestled 'twixt mountains so high, they poke impudent fingers at the very heavens, as if to tickle the Almighty himself. And bless you, if you ain't got the breath of a runaway locomotive, you'll be tickled right back, gasping for air thin enough to see through, like watered-down whiskey. Carriages, ye notice none; bless the Swiss, they've forbidden the infernal combustion engine within its pristine bounds. 'Tis a curious thing, this forced simplicity. Makes one ponder, does it not, if the Swiss weren't secretly hoarding all the petrol for themselves, planning to conquer the world by stealth, fueled by melted cheese and a cunning absence of internal combustion?

Now, the Matterhorn, that jagged, toothy titan, looms over all, a picture postcard come to life, albeit one that's been through a rather rough tumble. Artists, I tell you, they're thick as flies 'round a sugar pot, each one trying to capture its haughty, unyielding spirit on canvas. I swear, if I see another watercolour rendering of that infernal mountain, I shall climb it myself, just to moon the lot of them from the summit. The tourists, of course, flock hither like sheep to a salt lick, all wide-eyed and agog, yammering in tongues I can't decipher, and dressed in clothes that scream "I've got money to burn, and no idea how to spend it tastefully". They toddle about the cobblestone streets, snapping photographs with their contraptions that capture fleeting moments, though none seem to capture the sheer ridiculousness of it all. Eating overpriced fondue is also a very popular activity. If you have a great love for melted cheese and can't find any other way to throw away your money, then be my guest. As for me, I'll stick to observing this curious pageant from a safe distance, perhaps with a glass of something stronger than mountain air, and marvel at the human comedy unfolding before my very eyes. It’s a right sight, this Zermatt, a curious blend of natural majesty and manufactured charm, a place where even the rocks seem to be charging a premium.
