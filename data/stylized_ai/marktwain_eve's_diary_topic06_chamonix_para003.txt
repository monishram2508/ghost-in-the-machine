Chamonix, bless its heart, is a village so thoroughly wedded to the sky it nearly forgets it has feet on the ground. It's a place where men grow beards the size of small shrubberies and speak in a language that sounds suspiciously like a yodel wrestling a bear. They claim to be discussing the price of rope and crampons, but I remain skeptical. One suspects they’re merely communicating the depth of their affection for the abominable snowman, that fellow being conveniently unseen yet always blamed for any misfortune involving a lost climber or a spilled fondue pot.

The village itself, like a charmingly rumpled aunt, sprawls agreeably in the valley, all timber and flower boxes overflowing with petunias so brazenly colored they’d make a peacock blush. Everywhere you look, there's a cathedral made of granite and capped with snow – Mont Blanc, she’s called, though "Big White Bully" might be a more accurate moniker, considering the number of poor souls who've attempted to tickle her summit and been summarily tossed back down. Now, I have no quarrel with mountains, mind you. They are admirable in their steadfast silence, unlike some of their worshippers, who seem convinced that shouting "Ooh-la-la!" at regular intervals will impress the glaciers.

But the truly remarkable thing about Chamonix is the audacity of its inhabitants. They’ll cheerfully strap themselves into contraptions designed to plummet down hillsides on slivers of wood, or dangle precariously from ice axes, all the while insisting they’re having “fun.” It's a strange sort of fun, I confess, one that requires a hefty dose of courage and a complete disregard for the principles of gravity. Still, one must admire their spirit. Perhaps there’s something to be said for courting danger, for flirting with the abyss, so long as one has a good stiff drink waiting at the bottom. And Chamonix, being French, provides ample opportunities for that particular form of redemption, I can assure you.
