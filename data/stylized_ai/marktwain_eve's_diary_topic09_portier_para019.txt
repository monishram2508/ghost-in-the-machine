Now, about this portier business. Seems a right foolish thing to call a curtain, doesn't it? Like folks is trying to sound fancier than a gilded outhouse. A portier! Why not just say “door-blanket” and be done with it? But no, we gotta borrow a word from the French, likely because they got a lock on suffering through uncomfortable fashion, and slap it on something that's been keeping drafts out since Cain and Abel’s mamma thought to hang a bearskin across the cave entrance. Though, I suspect even Eve wouldn’t have called it a portier; she was too busy naming things practical.

Anyway, I saw one t’other day in a parlor, all fluffed up with tassels and what-nots, lookin’ for all the world like a constipated peacock. The mistress of the house, a woman who could swallow a lemon whole and not make a face, declared it kept the chills at bay. Chills! It looked more likely to give you the fantods. Made of some heavy velvet, it was, that sucked up all the light like a greedy miser hoarding gold. I reckon you'd need a team of oxen to haul it back and forth every time someone wanted to enter the room. And the dust it must collect! Why, I bet you could excavate a whole new civilization out of its folds every spring cleaning.

I reckon it served its purpose, though. That parlor was so dark and gloomy, folks likely couldn’t see how poorly the floral arrangements were done. Or maybe it was meant to hide the mistress’s newest dress, a contraption so full of bustles and bows that she resembled nothing so much as a runaway sofa. Truth be told, I didn’t spend too much time admiring that portier. I was too busy scheming about how to rig up a pulley system to draw the thing back, revealing the unfortunate dress underneath, and then blame the whole affair on the house cat. Now *that*, that would have been a sight worth naming, be it portier or no.
