Brigham, that singular cuss, was a sight to behold, a veritable mountain of a man, clad in homespun and possessed of a gaze that could wither a sagebrush at fifty paces. He ran his empire, this Deseret, with the iron fist of a benevolent despot, a paradox so grand it’d make your head spin faster than a roulette wheel in a saloon on a Saturday night. They said he had more wives than hairs on a grizzly bear, a figure I wouldn't wager against, considering the teeming population of petticoats that flitted about Temple Square. Whether he loved ‘em all is a question best left unanswered, lest you find yourself digging potatoes in the outer colonies for the next decade. He was a practical man, Brigham, with a head for irrigation and a stomach for hard work, qualities sorely needed in that barren expanse. Some called him a prophet, others a charlatan, but no one, not even his most ardent detractor, could deny he possessed a certain genius for organization. He wrangled a whole damn city out of the desert, planted crops where tumbleweeds used to dance, and convinced thousands to follow him to a place that looked like the Lord had forgotten it existed. He wasn't much for flowery speeches or philosophical debates, preferring instead to speak in parables laced with the salty wisdom of a frontiersman. He had a way of making the improbable seem not only possible, but downright inevitable. The man could sell ice to an Eskimo, and then convince him he needed a second block. You might not agree with his methods, or his… proclivities, but you couldn't help but marvel at the sheer audacity of the enterprise. He was a character, a spectacle, a living, breathing tall tale come to life, and the West wouldn't be the West without him. Say what you will about Brigham, he was one hell of a show.
