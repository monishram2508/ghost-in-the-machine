Well, I do declare, if there ain’t something peculiar about these glaciers! Eve, bless her cotton socks, she sees it as just another pretty bauble, like a particularly glistening icicle left out in the sun just a little too long. A “frozen river of sparkly tears,” she calls it. Lands, if that ain’t just the most flowery way to describe a hulking mass of ice that's been dragging its sorry self across the land for, well, longer than Methuselah lived, I don’t know what is. Says she feels sorry for it, all slow and burdened. I told her, Eve, honey, feel sorry for the ground getting scraped and gouged by that glacial galumphing! That’s where your sympathy’s wasted, not on a thing that crushes mountains and drinks lakes for breakfast.

And the way it moves! A snail has got more ambition, I swear. It just sort of... oozes. Like molasses in January, only colder and a whole heap heavier. You could plant a petunia on its edge and come back next year, and it might have only budged enough to tickle the petunia's roots. But don't you be fooled, oh no. That slow crawl is what carved out half the valleys we know! Now that's the kind of stubbornness I admire. Silent, steady, and utterly indifferent to your opinions about its speed.

Men say that these glaciers are melting. That would be a crying shame, and a big one at that. Why, if all that ice disappeared, we'd have oceans up to our ears. Eve says that’s what happens when man gets to tinkering and messing with what shouldn’t be messed with. I don't know about all that. But I do know that something that old and imposing deserves a bit of respect. Besides, where else am I going to get my ice for my mint juleps if the glacier decides to up and vanish? That's a thought that chills me right down to the bone, colder than any glacier ever could.
