Well, I reckon the Neckar is a river, or what passes for one in these parts of Germany. Claims to be longer than my patience sometimes, arising up in the Black Forest like a persistent rumor and meandering its way all the way to Mannheim where it finally throws itself into the Rhine with a sigh, probably glad to be done with it. Now, don't get me wrong, it's a pretty enough thing in spots. You can find towns clinging to its banks like gossip to a parson's wife, complete with half-timbered houses looking like they might tumble right in if you breathed on them too hard. Heidelberg is there, perched on a hill overseeing the whole shebang like an old dowager disapproving of everyone's attire. And those castle ruins? Why, they're picturesque enough to make a stone weep, if stones were given to such melancholic displays.

But let's not pretend the Neckar is the Mississippi, or even the Danube, for that matter. Its glory days, if it ever had any, are long past. It's been tamed and dammed and generally put in its place by those industrious Germans, who seem to have a mania for ordering nature about. Barges laden with who-knows-what chug along its surface, leaving behind a trail of oily rainbows, and pleasure boats full of tourists wave their cameras like weapons. You see, it is a working river, not some romantic flowing poem. And while I admire industry, there's something a bit sad about seeing a river reduced to a mere highway.

And the water itself? Well, it's not exactly crystal clear, let's just say. It is the color of something brewing deep within the Earth, perhaps a strong tea or a mild sewage. However, I haven't heard of anyone spontaneously combusting from touching it, so I suppose that's something. All in all, the Neckar is a useful river, if not a particularly inspiring one. It’s like that dependable relative you have to invite to the family reunion, even though they tell the same boring stories every time. You respect them, you tolerate them, but you don't exactly yearn for their company. That's the Neckar, plain and simple, and perhaps that's its charm in the end.
