Naples, ah, Naples! A city that assaults the senses like a street vendor's bellow or a rogue wave crashing over the bow of a modest fishing skiff. I've seen cleaner cities, I confess, though I’m hard pressed to recollect exactly where, as most metropolises seem to labor under the burden of humanity's refuse. Naples, however, embraces its grime with a gusto that borders on the theatrical. One might suspect the very dust motes dancing in the sunlit alleys have staged a performance of perpetual disarray. The laundry, strung across narrow streets like victorious banners after some unseen battle, adds a splash of color to the otherwise muted palette of peeling paint and crumbling plaster. Indeed, one feels like they’ve stumbled into a scene from a grand opera, albeit one where the orchestra is perpetually out of tune and the principal tenor is more likely to be hawking wares than serenading a fair maiden.

The Neapolitan himself, bless his fiery soul, is a creature of contradictions. He is charmingly, almost aggressively, helpful, particularly if there's a lira or two to be gained in the process. He will gesticulate wildly, explaining in rapid-fire Italian directions that are perfectly logical in his mind, but utterly incomprehensible to the wandering tourist. And should you manage to navigate your way through the labyrinthine streets, dodging Vespas and avoiding the suspicious puddles that collect in every crevice, you’ll be rewarded with the scent of pizza that rivals the fragrance of a thousand roses, if one could imagine such a preposterous bouquet. Why, even the beggars here possess a certain panache, their outstretched hands somehow suggesting they’re doing you a favor by accepting your charity. It's a city of delightful chaos, Naples, a place where the past whispers from every crumbling facade and the future unfolds with the unpredictable fervor of a volcano about to blow its top. Take heed, dear reader, for to visit Naples is to surrender to its eccentric charm, and to emerge, perhaps, a little bit more Neapolitan oneself.
