Now, about this sepulchre business. I've seen a few in my day, mostly in Europe, where they seem to have a penchant for piling stones on dead folks. Not like here in the States, where we mostly stick 'em in the ground and be done with it. No, sir, over there they erect these elaborate, stony contraptions, fit to house a small family, let alone a single, expired individual. Makes you wonder if they expect the departed to throw a house party once they get settled in. 

I recall one in Rome, the tomb of some emperor or other, all marble and grand as a politician's promise. Inside, it was gloomier than a rainy Sunday afternoon in a preacher's house, and dustier than an old maid's attic. They had these sarcophagi, which are just fancy coffins made of stone, and the emperor's was covered in carvings, depicting him winning battles and generally being a swell fellow. Of course, who's going to carve the truth on a tomb? "Here lies Tiberius, a notorious grump who hated children and preferred the company of goats?" Wouldn't sell postcards, I reckon.

And then there was another in Paris, belonging to some celebrated general. This one was all about patriotism, with statues of weeping angels and valiant soldiers, forever guarding the remains of their esteemed leader. It was impressive, I'll give it that. But I couldn't help but think the fellow inside probably didn't give a hoot about all the fanfare. He was dead, after all. Doubt he cared much about weeping angels or valiant soldiers. More likely, he was just wishing he'd invested in a decent pair of shoes while he was still among the living. Seems to me, all this sepulchre business is mostly for the living, to make them feel better about the inevitable. It's a grand show, a costly performance, but when you're lying six feet under, I suspect a plain wooden box is just as good as a palace of stone.
