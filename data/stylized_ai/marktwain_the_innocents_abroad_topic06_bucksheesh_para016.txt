Now, about this bucksheesh, this oriental grease that oils the wheels of progress, or rather, the palms of officials, in these sun-baked lands. A traveler new to the Levant, fresh off the boat and clinging to his Western notions of fair play, might find himself confounded by the universal application of the thing. He approaches a customs agent, you see, expecting efficiency and bureaucratic rigor, armed with his declaration forms and his best attempts at a respectful demeanor. Instead, he finds a man whose eyes, behind their perpetually drooping lids, gleam with an altogether different kind of expectation. A subtle clearing of the throat, a barely perceptible extending of the hand, and suddenly, it becomes clear that progress, like a stubborn mule, requires a little…persuasion.

And persuasion, in this context, takes the form of a small coin, slipped discreetly across the counter like a guilty secret. He may think it scandalous, bribery plain and simple! But I say, consider the alternative. He could stand there all day, fanning himself in the oppressive heat, his meticulously packed steamer trunk gathering dust while officials find ever more inventive reasons to delay his passage. Bucksheesh, then, becomes not so much a corrupting force, but a lubricant, easing the friction of daily life. It's a toll, levied not by the government, mind you, but by individuals exercising their own peculiar interpretation of supply and demand. The more complicated the task, the larger the bucksheesh required, naturally. Want a donkey cart to appear with astonishing speed? Bucksheesh. Need a particularly delectable piece of baklava smuggled from the bakery? Bucksheesh. Seeking to avoid a conversation with a particularly persistent street vendor selling imitation antiquities? You guessed it, a discreet offering of bucksheesh. It seems that in these lands, every transaction, no matter how small, is seasoned with this peculiar flavor, this inescapable aroma of expectation. It's a system, chaotic and undeniably flawed, but as effective as a rusty, well-used scythe. And one soon learns to adapt, to carry a pocketful of coins, ever ready to grease the wheels of fortune, lest one be left stranded, like a ship becalmed in a sea of red tape.
