Zermatt, ah, Zermatt! A little village perched so high amidst the Alps it makes one question if God, in a fit of absent-mindedness, forgot to finish building the world and simply shrugged, declaring, "Close enough!" The air is so rarefied, a chap can barely wheeze out a compliment to the local Frauleins, let alone chase after them. And the mountains! They stand about like grumpy old patriarchs, all craggy and white-bearded with snow, daring you to conquer them. Of course, there’s the Matterhorn, sticking up like a particularly impertinent thumb, demanding attention from every postcard and painting. It’s a magnificent sight, undeniably, but one can't help but suspect it gets a bit puffed up with its own importance.

The streets are paved with charming little shops, selling enough cuckoo clocks and cowbells to deafen an entire nation. And the tourists! Bless their cotton socks, they flock here like moths to a rather expensive, Swiss-made flame. One sees every nationality imaginable, all bundled in layers of clothing thicker than a bishop's conscience, snapping pictures of everything that doesn't move – and a few things that do. The skiing, I am told, is heavenly. Though, having witnessed more than one unfortunate soul careening down the slopes with the grace of a drunken penguin, I'm inclined to believe hellish might be a more accurate descriptor. Yet, they return, bruised and battered but beaming, swearing they've never had a better time. Perhaps there is a certain lunacy involved in hurling oneself down an icy precipice. In the evenings, the village hums with a quiet industriousness. Everyone is either consuming vast quantities of cheese fondue, comparing skiing scars, or plotting their early morning assault on another unsuspecting mountain. Zermatt, you see, is not merely a place; it's an exercise in the art of blissful, high-altitude absurdity.
