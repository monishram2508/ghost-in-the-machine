I declare, this glacier! It’s a monstrous, creeping thing, ain’t it? A frozen river, slower than a Mississippi steamboat stuck in the mud, but powerful enough to grind mountains into gravel like a coffee mill. Eve tells me it’s made of snow, compressed tighter than a miser's fist around a dollar bill. Well, I reckon I can believe that, seeing as there’s snow enough up here to keep Santa Claus busy for a thousand Christmases. It’s a sight to behold, certainly. All blue and white and sparkly, like a giant’s diamond brooch. Though I wouldn’t recommend trying to pin it on; it’d likely drag you down into a crevasse deeper than my Aunt Polly’s well.

And the sounds it makes! A constant groaning and creaking, like an old man complaining about his rheumatism. Eve says it's the ice shifting and cracking, and I suppose it is, but I prefer to imagine it's the glacier grumbling about having to lug all that snow around. It's constantly shedding little bits and pieces, too. "Calving," Eve calls it, as if it were a cow giving birth to icebergs. Which, I suppose, in a roundabout way, it is. These chunks go tumbling down into the water, making a splash big enough to give a whale a fright. It's a bit unsettling, though. Makes you wonder if the whole darn thing isn’t planning on sliding into the sea and taking us all with it. Eve assures me it won’t, not for a good long while, at least. But you know how women are with their "assurances." Likely as not, it’ll be gone tomorrow, and we’ll be left standing here with nothing but a pile of rocks and a story to tell about the time we saw the biggest ice cube this side of the North Pole. It seems a terrible waste, though. All that ice, just drifting away into the ocean. Seems like someone could bottle it up and sell it to folks down south. They’d pay a pretty penny for a genuine glacier ice cube in the middle of July, I reckon.
