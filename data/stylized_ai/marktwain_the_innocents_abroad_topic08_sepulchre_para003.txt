Now, a sepulchre, you say? Why, that’s just a fancy name for a glorified dirt nap. Some folks go to great lengths to avoid the common ground, the pauper’s corner, the eternal resting place where you’re cheek-by-jowl with old man Hemlock who smelled perpetually of onions and never paid his debts. No, sir, they gotta have themselves a sepulchre, carved outta marble finer than a banker's waistcoat, and big enough to house a small family, or at least a particularly plump hog. They expect to impress even in death, which strikes me as a trifle optimistic, seeing as they’re not likely to be doing much inspecting.

I reckon it’s all for the living, though, ain’t it? A way to tell the neighbors, “Look here, we had more money than sense, and we’re going to flaunt it even after we've kicked the bucket." The carvings, mind you, are often something to behold. Angels with expressions sour enough to curdle milk, weeping willows that wouldn’t look out of place in a swamp, and the deceased themselves, often depicted looking far more serene and saintly than they ever managed in real life. Seems to me, a good solid headstone with the name and dates is sufficient. Save the marble for a decent billiard table, I say. At least that way, somebody's getting some use out of it.

And the upkeep! Why, you could hire a full-time gardener just to keep the moss and the bird droppings at bay. It's a never-ending battle, that. The sepulchre, you see, becomes another chore for the grieving family, another reminder of the departed’s earthly grandeur, and another bill to pay. It's a powerful temptation to just let the whole thing crumble, let nature reclaim it, and let old man Hemlock have the last laugh, after all. But then, what would the neighbors say? Heavens forfend that you'd be accused of neglecting the dead! Best to just keep polishing that marble, I suppose, and hoping the next life has a better class of birds. After all, a gentleman must maintain appearances, even when he’s six feet under.
