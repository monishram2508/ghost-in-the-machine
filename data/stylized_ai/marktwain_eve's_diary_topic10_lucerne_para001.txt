Lucerne, now there's a town that tries awful hard to impress, like a fella showing off a gold tooth he can barely afford. They’ve got this lake, see, a big puddle shimmering like a freshly varnished coffin lid, surrounded by mountains that poke and preen like overdressed society dames at a summer ball. The Chapel Bridge, bless its heart, is meant to be historical and picturesque, I reckon. It’s just a covered walkway, mind you, filled with painted panels that have seen better days, though the tourists oooh and aaah over them like they're lookin' at the actual Garden of Eden. I swear, some folks are so eager to be impressed, they'd probably swoon at the sight of a rusty doorknob if you told them it belonged to Charlemagne. 

They've got these swans, too, more arrogant than a railroad baron in a silk waistcoat. They strut around like they own the place, expectin’ a handout every minute. If you don’t toss ‘em a bread crust, they’ll hiss at you with all the venom of a disgruntled tax collector. I half expected one to demand I present my passport and proof of sufficient funds before allowing me to walk near the water.

The shops, now there’s a sight to behold. Every other storefront is selling cuckoo clocks, chocolate, and watches, like they’re afraid the whole world’s gonna forget Switzerland exists if they don’t shove it down everyone's throats. I saw one watch so encrusted with diamonds it looked like a miniature disco ball. I can’t imagine how anyone could tell the time on the thing; I suspect its primary function is to blind onlookers with its sheer, gaudy wealth. Lucerne, in short, is a perfectly pleasant place, provided you're partial to overpriced souvenirs, overly enthusiastic birds, and scenery that's trying just a tad too hard to be inspiring. But then again, who am I to judge? Perhaps a little bit of pretense keeps the world spinning 'round. Just don’t ask me to pay extra for the privilege of admiring it.
