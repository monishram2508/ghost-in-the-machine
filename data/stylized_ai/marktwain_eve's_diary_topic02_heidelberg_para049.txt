Heidelberg. A town draped upon the Neckar like a particularly flamboyant boa constrictor, all verdant hills and the gaudy bauble of a castle perched atop it. You would think, looking at it from a distance, that this was Paradise itself, a place where the rivers ran with Rhinewine and the very air smelled of roasted boar. But don’t let the pretty pictures fool you, Eve. The castle, mind you, is undeniably grand, a monstrous ruin that must have given pause even to the most bellicose of medieval princes, before their own castle came crashing down. But a ruin it remains, a monument to time's relentless grinding teeth, and a testament to the German habit of building things so grand they're simply begging to be bombarded.

Now, the inhabitants, a curious mixture of ancient professors who resemble nothing so much as scholarly garden gnomes, and hordes of young students, so full of youthful exuberance they practically vibrate. The students, ah, the students! They practice their fencing with such vigor that one wonders how many tourists have inadvertently found themselves skewered upon a rapier. And their songs! They sing with a gusto that could shake the very foundations of the crumbling castle, usually about love, beer, and the lamentable lack of both. Their faces are permanently flushed with beer, their eyes bright with mischief, and their pockets conspicuously empty, no doubt having been emptied at one of the many establishments selling the aforementioned beer. I watched one the other day, attempt to woo a particularly austere-looking Fraulein with a serenade that sounded suspiciously like a drunken cat fight. It was a spectacle, I tell you, a spectacle.

And the Neckar, ah, the Neckar! A beautiful river, indeed, unless one happens to be looking at it from below. Which I, naturally, did not. I merely observed that it possessed a certain swift current, ideal for ferrying barges laden with coal, and the odd, ill-advised student engaging in a late-night skinny dip. All in all, Heidelberg is a charming place, even if its charm is a bit on the boisterous, overly intellectual, slightly ruined side. A bit like a particularly eccentric aunt who’s inherited a fortune but hasn't quite figured out what to do with it, other than wear it all at once. You’ll like it, Eve. Just keep a sharp eye out for those rapiers.
