Lucerne, you understand, is one of them Swiss towns that thinks itself prettier than a speckled hen, and a deal more important. It sits there, right smack-dab on the lake, like a fat dowager draped in emeralds, preening at its reflection. And that lake, bless its heart, is clear as gin and just as intoxicating, all the while showcasing the mountains like a jeweler showing off diamonds. They call it Vierwaldstättersee, which sounds about as appetizing as a mouthful of gravel, but looks like heaven itself dipped in cerulean paint. Now, they've got this bridge, a covered affair all done up with paintings. The locals call it the Kapellbrücke, or Chapel Bridge, and the pictures inside detail the life and times of St. Leodegar and St. Maurice, saints who look about as thrilled to be stuck in a bridge as I would be. Trouble is, a goodly chunk of it burned down some years ago, leaving a rather large, charred gap. They rebuilt it, of course, but it’s like putting a fresh patch on an old pair of britches; you can always tell where the trouble was. You'll find them tourists by the score, ambling across it, snapping pictures, and generally making a racket, quite oblivious to the fact that they're traipsing through history—a history that, thanks to that fire, now smells faintly of burnt popcorn. Then there's the Lion Monument, a pathetic critter carved out of a cliff face. It's supposed to be mourning the Swiss Guards who died defending the Tuileries during the French Revolution, and it looks like it has a toothache. Mark my words, if lions could talk, this one would be begging for a hefty dose of laudanum and a quiet place to die. The whole city's just a bit too perfectly arranged, a bit too tidy. It’s like they've ironed out all the wrinkles of life, leaving behind a smooth, bland surface. Still, the beer's cold, the cheese is holey, and the scenery's tolerable, so one can't complain too loudly, lest they be accused of ingratitude—a fate worse than a week spent trapped in that mournful lion's dental practice.
