Mormonism, more formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a restorationist Christian faith that originated in the United States during the 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith, Jr., the church proclaims to be a restoration of the original church established by Jesus Christ, lost through centuries of apostasy. Central to Mormon belief is the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible and regarded as another testament of Jesus Christ. This text, according to the faith's narrative, details the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Christ after his resurrection. Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates revealed to him by an angel named Moroni.

The core tenets of Mormonism include a belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ as the Savior, and the Holy Ghost as a distinct member of the Godhead. Unlike traditional Trinitarian theology, Mormon doctrine postulates a plurality of Gods, with God the Father having once been a mortal being who progressed to godhood. Salvation, in Mormon theology, is attained through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion, and receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands by authorized priesthood holders. Latter-day Saints also emphasize the importance of temple worship, where they participate in sacred ordinances, including proxy baptisms for the dead, aimed at offering salvation to those who died without the opportunity to accept the Gospel. The church's global missionary program, where young men and women volunteer to proselytize around the world, plays a significant role in its growth and dissemination of its teachings. Mormon culture is characterized by a strong emphasis on family, community, and adherence to a strict moral code that includes abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, often referred to as the Word of Wisdom. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown from a small, controversial sect to a worldwide religion with millions of members, exerting considerable influence in various aspects of society, particularly in the Western United States.
