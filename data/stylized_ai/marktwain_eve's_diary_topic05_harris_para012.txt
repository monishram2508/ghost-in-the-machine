Harris, bless his cotton socks, was a conundrum wrapped in a slightly soiled duster. He was a fellow who believed deeply in the profound importance of knowing absolutely nothing about practically everything. Said he’d once held a position – though what manner of position remained shrouded in the mists of his own self-importance – where knowing things got in the way of pure, unadulterated thinking. You see, Harris possessed a mind that was beautifully, gloriously vacant. A vast and untamed prairie upon which not so much as a single tumbleweed of useful information dared to sprout.

He approached life with a blithe carelessness that bordered on the sublime. We once ventured out, the three of us (that’s me, Jerome, and George, for those keeping score at home), for a day of fishing. Harris, armed with a rod that looked suspiciously like it’d been liberated from a scarecrow, proceeded to tangle his line around every tree, shrub, and passing goose within a five-mile radius. He never caught a thing, naturally. Claimed the fish were simply too impressed with his "unique" casting technique to bite.

What Harris did possess, however, was an unfailing confidence that far outweighed his abilities. He could confidently assert that the earth was flat, the moon made of cheese, and that squirrels were secretly plotting world domination, all with the conviction of a seasoned astronomer giving a lecture at the Royal Society. And you couldn’t help but grin, not because you agreed with him, heavens no, but because the sheer audacity of his ignorance was simply captivating. He was a walking, talking, and frequently stumbling reminder that sometimes, the most entertaining thing in the world is a fellow who's utterly, gloriously wrong about everything. He may have been a trial, that Harris, but he was a thoroughly diverting one, like a poorly executed magic trick that still manages to elicit a chuckle. Yes, sir, Harris was a character, a peculiar specimen of humanity, best observed from a safe distance, preferably with a well-stocked picnic basket and a strong sense of irony.
