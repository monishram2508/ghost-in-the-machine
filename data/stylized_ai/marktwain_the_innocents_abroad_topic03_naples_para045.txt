Ah, Naples. A city, if you can call it that, which seems to have been cobbled together from spare parts and good intentions, neither of which were ever quite sufficient. I reckon even the dust in Pompei feels a touch fresher than what circulates in those Neapolitan lanes. One ventures forth expecting to see antiquity, and one does – antiquity in the form of laundry hanging precariously across alleyways so narrow a determined rat could barely squeeze through, and antiquity in the crumbling facades of buildings that look as though they might collapse into a pile of rubble should you so much as whisper a harsh word in their direction. The streets! Good heavens, the streets! A tangle of humanity and beasts of burden, all vying for the same patch of cobblestone, with a symphony of horns and shouts that would deafen a steamboat whistle. I saw a man driving a cart piled high with tomatoes, arguing vehemently with a priest who, in turn, was attempting to shoo away a goat that had designs on said tomatoes. One half expects Vesuvius to erupt again, if only to restore some semblance of order to the proceedings.

But here's the oddity: despite the chaos, despite the general air of "almost-but-not-quite," there's a vitality to Naples that's utterly captivating. They've a way of squeezing joy out of the very stones, these Neapolitans. You'll see families gathered in tiny piazzas, laughing and gesticulating with an intensity that would put a seasoned actor to shame. They eat with a gusto, sing with a passion, and argue with a flair that's truly breathtaking. And the food! One can hardly deny the simple magnificence of a Neapolitan pizza, even if it’s devoured while dodging a runaway donkey cart. So, is Naples a beautiful city? No, sir, not by any conventional definition. Is it an interesting city? Is it a memorable city? Is it a city that will burrow under your skin and stay there, long after you've sailed away? Well, I suppose the answer to that is a resounding yes. It's a glorious mess, Naples is, and all the more lovable for it.
