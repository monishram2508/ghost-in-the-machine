Winter, she comes on like a bill collector with a bad temper and a heart colder than a boarding house landlady. First, you get a dusting of snow, just enough to make you think, "Well, ain't that pretty?" then BAM! She unleashes the whole kit and caboodle. Winds howl like a pack of coyotes arguing over a particularly scrawny rabbit, and the snow piles up faster than a miner can stake a claim on a gold strike. The thermometer shrinks faster than a greenhorn's bankroll in a saloon. You start to see fellas walkin' around lookin' like they swallowed a pine tree whole, bundled up so thick you reckon they could fall off a cliff and just bounce. 

And the wildlife? Don't even get me started. Squirrels buryin' nuts like they're hidin' government secrets, birds flyin' south faster than a politician retractin' a promise, and the bears… well, the bears are smart. They’re snug as bugs in a rug. Me? I ain't so lucky. I’m stoking the fire till my arms ache and breathin' in more smoke than a locomotive. Everything creaks and groans, from the house to my joints, as if the whole world's holdin' its breath waitin' for the thaw. 

Folks get a bit peculiar, too. Grumpy as a badger with a toothache and about as friendly. The only time you see a smile is when someone slips on the ice, and then it's usually followed by a hearty chuckle and a muttered, "Serves ya right for tryin' to walk fancy!" Even the liquor seems to freeze a little slower, like it's givin' you one last chance to reconsider. Truth be told, winter’s a fine time for readin’ by the fire, if you got a good book and enough wood to last. But if you ask me, it's a whole lot like a long, drawn-out sermon – tedious and you’re relieved as all get out when it finally comes to an end.
