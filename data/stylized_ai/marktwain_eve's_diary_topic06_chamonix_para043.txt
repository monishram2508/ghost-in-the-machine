Chamonix, you say? Ah, a village nestled 'neath the skirts of Mont Blanc, that blustering old crone of a mountain. They call it the “Mecca of Alpinism,” which sounds grand, mind you, as if the pilgrims are ascending to worship ice axes and frostbite. More like a Mecca of bruised egos and wallets considerably lighter than when one arrived, I reckon. One finds oneself immediately assaulted by a cacophony of languages, a Tower of Babel after a particularly potent vin chaud. Germans meticulously plotting routes as if conquering Prussia, Brits cheerfully inquiring after afternoon tea whilst dangling precariously from a cliff face, and the French, well, they are simply being French, which is a feat in itself, wouldn't you agree? The air, crisp as a freshly laundered bank note, carries the scent of pine and adventure, though mostly the latter, I suspect, is concocted in the marketing departments.

And the gear! Lord Almighty, the gear! One could outfit an entire polar expedition with the contents of a single shop window. Climbing boots that cost more than my first horse, ropes thicker than my Aunt Mildred’s waistline, and goggles that seem to promise the wearer immunity from both snow blindness and good sense. They stride about, these alpinists, looking terribly serious and self-important, like beetles adorned with the latest in wearable technology. It’s quite amusing, really, to watch them attempt to navigate the crowded main street after a day on the slopes, still sporting all their mountaineering paraphernalia, looking for all the world like displaced robots who've wandered into a quaint alpine postcard. One cannot help but wonder if the mountain actually enjoys their frantic scrambling about, or if she merely tolerates them the way a cat tolerates a particularly persistent flea. I lean towards the latter, myself. Mont Blanc, I suspect, has seen far grander sights and is simply waiting for them all to go home, so she can get back to being majestic in peace and quiet.
