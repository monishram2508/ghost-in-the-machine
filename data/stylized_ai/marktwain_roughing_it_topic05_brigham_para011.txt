Brigham, ah, Brigham Young! A feller could write a book, a whole bloomin' library, on that man and still not scrape the bottom of the barrel. He was a spectacle, that’s certain. Not a handsome one, mind you, unless you've got a fondness for a countenance carved outta granite by a drunken sculptor after a particularly harsh winter. They say he had a will of iron, and by golly, I reckon he did. Iron and just a leetle pinch of somethin’ else—call it ambition, call it divine guidance, call it what you will, but it moved mountains, that much is true. Why, he hauled the whole kit and caboodle of Mormons across the plains, further than a man’s got any right to drag a soul, and planted 'em smack dab in the middle of nowhere, convinced he'd found the promised land. And doggone if they didn’t build a city out of dust and faith, proving that persistence is a mighty powerful tool, even when wielded by a fella with a face like a disappointed bulldog.

He was a pragmatic sort, Brigham was. Didn't shy away from getting his hands dirty, be it irrigating a field or orchestrating a bit of what some might call "controversy." Polygamy, now there's a topic to set tongues a-waggin'. Some folks whispered behind their hands, calling it a scandal and an abomination. Others claimed it was divinely ordained, the key to populating Zion with righteous souls. Me? I ain't one to judge a man's private affairs, so long as he keeps the peace and doesn't try to borrow my mule. Fact is, Brigham managed to keep all those wives and offspring fed and clothed, which is more than I can say for half the fellers I met back East. And while some may poke fun at his numerous family, you can’t deny that he created a community, a self-sustaining republic right there in the desert. Whether you agreed with his methods or not, you had to admit that Brigham Young was a force to be reckoned with, a human dynamo in a frock coat, and a prime example of the peculiar and often contradictory nature of the American West.
