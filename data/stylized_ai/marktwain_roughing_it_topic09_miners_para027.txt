Them miners, now there's a breed of cat that could skin a mule and not even raise a sweat doing it. Lord, I’ve seen 'em tougher than a boiled owl, and just as likely to hoot at the moon after a few slugs of rotgut. They come to these hills dreaming of El Dorado, pockets empty and spirits full of grit, all ready to yank that fortune right out of the earth’s greedy gullet. They’d spend their days hacking and clawing, sweating like a hog in July, chasing after that glint of gold that's always just around the next bend in the tunnel. And for what? Mostly dust, a few measly flakes, and a back that'll remind 'em of their folly every time it rains. 

But don't you dare call 'em fools. Oh no, they got a stubbornness that could outlast a Missouri mule race. They’d gamble away their last dime on a hand of poker, then turn around and cheerfully burrow another ten feet into the bowels of the earth, all on the hope of striking it rich. They’d argue about the best way to prop a tunnel (and likely do it the wrong way, anyways), fight over the last swig of water in a canteen, and then share a mournful song about lost love by the campfire as if nothing ever happened. 

And talk about their fashion sense. Lord, it was something to behold. Pants patched more times than a politician's promises, shirts stiff with grime, and boots that looked like they'd fought a war and lost. They sported beards that could house a family of field mice and smelled strongly of damp earth and blasting powder. But beneath all that dirt and questionable hygiene, there was a heart of gold, ironically enough. They'd help a fella out, share their meager grub, and crack a joke that'd make you laugh even when you were feeling lower than a snake's belly. Yes sir, the miner was a peculiar species, a blend of grit, greed, and good-natured cussedness that you just couldn't find anywhere else. A rough diamond, you might say, just waiting to be polished by a stroke of luck – or maybe just another explosion.
