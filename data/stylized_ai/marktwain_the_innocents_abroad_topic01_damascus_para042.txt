Damascus, they call it the "Pearl of the Orient," though bless my soul, if I can rightly tell which ocean that pearl might be bobbing in. It's older than Methuselah, this city, and likely just as stubborn. One stumbles upon relics of civilizations past at every turn, like finding a used horseshoe in a stable – commonplace, though interesting to contemplate on how many miles it has traveled. You see, they boast of its unbroken history, an eternal city, never fallen, never conquered. Which, let me tell you, is a tale spun a bit too thick for my liking. It's seen more conquerors than a saloon girl sees cowboys on a Saturday night, but I suppose each one just dusted off the furniture and declared themselves the new owner, so, technically, it still remains Damascus, merely with a different landlord. The streets, narrow enough to make a claustrophobic sweat, wind and twist like a politician trying to explain a campaign promise. You're perpetually lost, but never truly in danger, unless you count the occasional donkey cart loaded precariously high with melons. The merchants, bless their grasping souls, are a study in artful haggling. They’ll offer you the moon for a price only slightly lower than its weight in gold, but with enough persistence, and a touch of dramatic offense at the initial offer, you can usually shave it down to something resembling a reasonable gouge. And the coffee! Strong enough to wake the dead, or at least keep them from snoring too loudly. They say it’s the birthplace of roses, and while I spotted a few, they seemed rather embarrassed about the whole affair, wilting a bit under the weight of the city's history and the overwhelming aroma of spices. It’s a city of contrasts, Damascus, beautiful and bewildering, ancient and perpetually renewed, a place where the past rubs shoulders with the present and whispers secrets in a language I only half understand, yet fully appreciate the music of.
