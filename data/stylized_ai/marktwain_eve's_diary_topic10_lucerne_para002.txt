Now, Lucerne, that's a town that tries awful hard to be picturesque, and mostly succeeds, which is a kind of triumph, I reckon. It's got mountains lookin' down on it, Pilatus and Rigi, like grumpy old uncles watchin' you eat cake and judgin' your manners. Lake Lucerne itself is all shimmery and blue, so blue it seems like the sky has fell in and got stuck. The town's crammed tight with bridges, especially that Chapel Bridge, which is older than Methuselah’s toothbrush, if he had one. They're all covered in pictures, mostly scenes of local doin’s, battles and plagues and fellows getting drowned, entertainin' stuff, though I daresay the tourist ladies are more interested in buyin’ chocolates.

The swans, Lord, them swans! You’d think they owned the place, strutting about like they'd inherited the entire lake. They're so used to bein' fed bread crusts they ain't got no respect for a body’s personal space. One near bit my hand clean off just for hesitating a moment with a stale piece of roll. Ungrateful beasts. The architecture's fine, I suppose, all them painted houses lookin’ like gingerbread men. But after a while, it all sort of blurs together – gables and frescoes and flower boxes, like somebody spilled a rainbow paint bucket all over the place. They’ve got a lion carved into a cliff, a mournin’ one, for them Swiss Guards who got wiped out in the French Revolution. A sad sight, but then again, half the sights in Europe involve somebody getting wiped out. And the tourists, well they swarm like locusts in the summer, clickin’ away with them picture machines and tryin' to buy the entire town. Still, can’t blame ‘em. Lucerne’s got a certain something, a sort of polite, Swiss-clockwork charm, that keeps you hooked, even when you're ready to smack a swan and run for the hills.
