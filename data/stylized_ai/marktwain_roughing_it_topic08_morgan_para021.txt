Now, Morgan, there was a specimen, a regular tapestry of contradictions woven into a single, slightly moth-eaten gentleman. Called himself an "entrepreneur," a fancy French word that likely meant he was perpetually one step ahead of the bill collectors, or at least trying to appear that way. He sported a handlebar mustache, the kind that practically dared you to tug on it, and a twinkle in his eye that suggested he knew secrets best left buried under ten feet of Nevada desert. He arrived in town with a trunk full of "innovations," contraptions that were supposed to make us all richer, faster, and probably immortal. One was a self-milking cow, which, upon demonstration, only managed to kick Morgan squarely in the shins and spill perfectly good milk all over his shiny boots. Another was a mechanical prospector, guaranteed to find gold with pinpoint accuracy; it instead, found a particularly large gopher hole and promptly got stuck, legs flailing in the air like a distressed beetle.

Yet, bless his cotton socks, you couldn't help but admire the man's audacity. He'd dust himself off, adjust his mustache, and declare, with unwavering conviction, that the "market wasn't quite ready" for his genius. He had the charisma of a traveling snake oil salesman and the business acumen of a goldfish, but somehow, he always managed to charm his way into another grubstake. He was a walking, talking advertisement for the triumph of optimism over common sense. He wore a suit too fancy for the town, but his pants somehow, always seemed to be perpetually on the verge of falling down, and that, seemed, to be the only thing about him that was real. He left just as quickly as he arrived, leaving behind a trail of unpaid debts, broken inventions, and a lingering sense of bewildered amusement. One couldn't help but suspect he was off to try and convince some other unsuspecting souls that he had the secret to turning lead into gold, or perhaps, just turning a profit on a self-milking cow.
