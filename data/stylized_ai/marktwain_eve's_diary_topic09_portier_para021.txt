Now, about this portier business. Adam, bless his simple heart, wouldn't know a portier from a potted geranium, unless, of course, it was blocking his way to the fig tree. A portier, for those of you who spend your days chasing butterflies and naming squirrels, is a sort of curtain, a drape, meant to hang in a doorway. Not just any doorway, mind you. It's got to be a doorway that feels the need for a bit of…drama, shall we say? Like a stage entrance for important thoughts, or perhaps a way to discreetly hide the untidiness that inevitably follows a man's attempts at organizing his rock collection. I took it upon myself to fashion one out of some particularly lush vines I found clinging to the backside of the waterfall. Thought it would add a touch of elegance, a certain je ne sais quoi, to the cave entrance. Adam, predictably, used it to wipe his muddy feet after a particularly spirited mud pie fight with a woolly mammoth. Honestly, sometimes I wonder if that man's brain is filled with anything more than dust bunnies and half-formed ideas about tool invention. He claimed it offered superior mud-absorbing properties compared to the usual moss. I swear, the man could find a practical application for a rainbow if he put his mind to it. But, heavens, trying to explain to him the artistry, the sheer decorative potential of a properly hung portier… It’s like trying to teach a parrot to sing opera. He'll squawk a bit, maybe mimic a high note now and then, but ultimately, he’ll just end up wanting a cracker. The portier, alas, now resembles a rather pathetic green fringe, covered in fossilized mud. I suppose even Paradise has its decorating disasters.
