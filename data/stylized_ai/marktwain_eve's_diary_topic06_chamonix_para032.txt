Chamonix, you say? A most peculiar place, perched like a cuckoo clock on the flank of Mont Blanc itself. One expects, naturally, to find only stoic, mountain-dwelling sorts inhabiting such a locale. And, to a degree, one is not disappointed. Burly fellows with beards so prodigious they could house a family of field mice lumber about, muttering of ascents and crevasses with a familiarity that suggests they were born in a glacier rather than a cradle. But then, dear reader, the reality smacks you with the force of an unexpected avalanche. For alongside these rugged souls, one finds a gaggle of… shall we say, *decorative* tourists. Ladies in furs (one hopes they are *faux*, else the conscience would be terribly disturbed) teetering on heels quite unsuited to cobblestone, and gentlemen sporting designer skiwear with nary a snowflake ever having kissed their cheek. They come, it seems, not to conquer the mountain, but to conquer the *image* of conquering the mountain.

They sip *vin chaud* in cafes, gossiping about their Parisian exploits with a reckless disregard for the breathtaking scenery surrounding them. One almost expects them to inquire whether the mountain matches their ensemble, and express dismay should it fail to compliment their shade of cerulean. And the shops! Oh, the shops! Filled with paraphernalia designed to convince the visitor that they are, in fact, an intrepid explorer. One can purchase ice axes that have never tasted ice, crampons that have never known a mountain's grip, and ropes that have never held anything more adventurous than a handbag. The whole enterprise is, I confess, a rather delicious absurdity. It’s as if humanity, having dreamt of conquering nature, has instead settled for conquering its *appearance* whilst quaffing a rather overpriced beverage. One is left to ponder, dear diary, whether this is progress or merely a particularly gaudy brand of madness.
