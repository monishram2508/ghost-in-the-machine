Well, I declare, the Portier. Now, there’s a contraption that would have Adam scratching his head something fierce, and not just because of the fig leaves itching him in all the wrong places. Imagine, if you will, a grand drape, heavy as a guilty conscience after pilfering the last apple, designed to keep the drafts at bay and nosy neighbors out. Not that we had neighbors back then, mind you, save for the occasional inquisitive serpent with a penchant for persuasive rhetoric. But I reckon if we *had* had neighbors, a Portier would have been just the ticket. Keeps a body's secrets locked up tighter than a miser's gold, it does.

It hangs there, majestic and imposing, like a judge about to deliver a particularly damning verdict. And usually, its job is simple enough: block the wind. But it's more than that, oh, much more! It's a divider, a separator of worlds. On one side, perhaps, sits the parlor, all lace and floral arrangements, prim and proper like a Sunday school teacher. On the other? Well, that's anyone's guess, isn't it? Could be the library, filled with scandalous novels that make a body blush. Or perhaps the billiard room, where gentlemen engage in all manner of suspicious activities involving cigars and whispered wagers. You never quite know what lurks beyond the Portier, which, truth be told, is half the fun. It's a gateway to possibilities, a curtain drawn on the unknown. And, like all the finer things in this world, you can be certain it is used to hide all sorts of sins. Why, I wouldn't be surprised to find a philandering husband sneaking through one this very evening, hoping his wife is too busy fussing over her needlepoint to notice his absence. A Portier, you see, is not just a curtain; it's an accomplice. A silent partner in the great game of secrets and deceptions that makes life, for all its troubles, just a little bit more interesting.
