 Pard, you say? Oh, the pard! Now there's a specimen that could curdle milk at twenty paces. Seen plenty of 'em out West, skulking around like a coyote with a guilty conscience. They ain't the kind you'd trust to hold your hat, let alone a winning hand at poker. You'd find 'em usually draped in store-bought finery – probably got it on credit and skipped town before the bill came due. Talk a mile a minute, they do, all smooth as butter churned by a saint, but meaning less than a politician’s promise. Their hands, now, are as soft as a gambler's alibi, never seen a day of honest toil, I wager. 

They'd usually be found hanging around the fancy saloons, lookin' for a gullible tenderfoot fresh off the stagecoach. You know the type – eyes wide as dinner plates, pockets bulging with more gold than sense. Pard, he'd latch onto him like a tick on a hound dog, weaving tales of fortunes to be made in silver mines and lost Spanish treasures. He'd buy the fella a drink – most likely watered-down whiskey disguised as the real McCoy – and begin his charm offensive. It’d be all smiles and backslaps, and promises of a partnership that was only as good as the pard's word, which, truth be told, ain't worth the powder to blow it to kingdom come. He'd spin a yarn thick as a buffalo robe, painting pictures of the land as lush as the Garden of Eden, leaving out only the rattlesnakes, dust devils, and the swindlers like himself. Then, quicker than you can say "Jack Robinson," the tenderfoot would be parting with his money, believing he'd just bought himself a piece of paradise. Of course, paradise would turn out to be a patch of barren desert where the only gold was the sun beating down on a man’s rapidly dwindling hopes and a lighter wallet. The pard, he’d be long gone. Vanished like smoke in a high wind, leavin' behind nothin' but a cloud of suspicion and a valuable lesson in human gullibility. Ah, the pard! A necessary evil, I reckon, in this grand, comical opera of life. Keeps things interesting, don’t you think?
