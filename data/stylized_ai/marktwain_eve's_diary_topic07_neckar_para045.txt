Well, I reckon I've seen rivers enough in my time to fill a good-sized bathtub, maybe even a small swimming pool if we’re feeling ambitious. But this Neckar, now, it's a curious little thing, ain’t it? Not quite the Mississippi, mind you, doesn’t have that grand ol' swagger, that muddy majesty. More like a respectable gentleman, perhaps a bit past his prime, who's learned to navigate polite society with a wry smile and a well-worn waistcoat. They say it winds its way through the Swabian lands, past vineyards plump with grapes destined for wines that probably wouldn't turn my head, but the locals seem to fancy. Heidelberg sits perched upon its banks like a dignified old dowager, casting a knowing glance at the tourists who flock to see the ruins of her youth.

The castles, now those are something. They loom over the river with all the drama of a stage play, except the actors have long since packed up their costumes and gone home. You can almost hear the whispers of knights and ladies, although it's more likely the wind whistling through the crumbling stones, playing tricks on your romantic notions. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a few grumpy ghosts lurking about, muttering about taxes and the rising price of mead. The water itself seems to reflect all this history, a sort of murky mirror to the past. You could probably dredge up a sunken treasure chest or two if you had the patience, but I suspect it would mostly be old beer bottles and rusty armor. Still, there's a certain charm to it all, a quiet sort of dignity that grows on you after a while. It might not be the biggest or the flashiest river, but the Neckar, well, it's got character, that's for certain. And in this world of imitations and empty boasts, a bit of genuine character is a treasure indeed, even if it does come with a side of muddy water and the faint scent of slightly stale beer.
