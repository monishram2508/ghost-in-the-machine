Higbie, now there’s a name that conjures up the smell of damp earth and the faint echo of a slammed shovel, wouldn't you agree? A man of ambition, he was, though his ambition rarely stretched beyond the next claim and the hope of striking something bigger than a gopher hole. He possessed a nose for gold that was only slightly better than a blind bloodhound’s, yet his optimism, bless his heart, was positively boundless. He’d squint at a barren patch of dust, declare it “likely lookin’,” and proceed to dig with the fervor of a badger on payday. And he’d always have some convoluted theory, too, usually involving the migration patterns of gold-bearing insects or the subterranean currents that carried nuggets up from the center of the earth. Nevermind that no reputable scientist – or even a disreputable one, for that matter – would give him the time of day. 

His claims were always just a bit off-center, you see. He’d stake one right next to the most profitable mine in the district, convinced the vein just *had* to run in his direction. He'd sink a shaft so deep you could hear echoes of disgruntled demons complaining about the disturbance. Then, after weeks of back-breaking labor, he'd inevitably hit not gold, but some other sort of worthless treasure – a particularly stubborn patch of clay, maybe, or a nest of surprisingly well-preserved desert scorpions. He’d dust himself off, offer a philosophical shrug, and declare that he’d “nearly had it.” "Just a foot to the left, or maybe right," he'd mumble, already eyeing the next prospect with that same unwavering faith that could either build an empire or bankrupt a church, depending on your perspective. He was a walking, talking advertisement for the eternal American dream of striking it rich, even if the only thing he ever struck was bedrock. And, truth be told, I kind of admired the old coot for it.
