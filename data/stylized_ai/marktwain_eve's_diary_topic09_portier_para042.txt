Well now, about this portier contraption. It's a peculiar invention, I declare, draped across a doorway like a shy debutante afraid to show her ankles. Made of heavy cloth, usually some damask thingamajig or velvet frippery, it’s supposed to keep out drafts, I reckon. As if a breeze is some kind of unspeakable horror that must be veiled! Back home, we just stuffed rags in the cracks, but that's neither here nor there. These portiers, they’re all about show, aren't they? Making out that there’s a profound difference between one room and the next when, let’s be frank, both are likely just as dusty and full of complaining children.

I have seen them adorned with tassels like a sultan's beard, and embroidered with scenes so grand you'd think they were painting a mural on your privacy. One I saw was supposed to be a pastoral scene, but the sheep looked more like disgruntled potatoes and the shepherd resembled a man who'd lost his way to the tavern. Some folks say they also muffle the sound, but I’ve yet to witness that miracle. My ears are still ringing from the children's hollering, portier or no portier. Honestly, it's more likely to just collect dust and provide a hiding place for lost buttons and the occasional errant beetle. You’d think, with all the resources poured into this piece of glorified drapery, that they could invent a way to keep the children from tracking mud inside. But, no. We're stuck with a fancy curtain that promises to add atmosphere but mostly adds work. And the cat, well, don't even get me started on the cat. She treats it like her own personal scratching post. Which, now that I think of it, is perhaps the most honest assessment of a portier I've yet come across.
