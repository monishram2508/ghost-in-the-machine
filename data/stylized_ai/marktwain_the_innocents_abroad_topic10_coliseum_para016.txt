Now, this Coliseum, bless its crumbling old heart, is a spectacle, a regular barnyard brawl of history and architecture wrestling for your attention. You wander through its arched entrances, same as a thousand gladiators, only you're armed with a selfie stick instead of a short sword – progress, I suppose, of a sort. And the ghosts, mind you, the ghosts! They're thick as flies on a summer picnic, buzzing around your ears, whispering tales of emperors and lions and Christians who’d rather sing hymns than be lunch. They say you can still hear the roar of the crowd on a windy day, though I suspect that’s just the pigeons squawking, indignant that you're cluttering up their historical roost.

You see the seating arrangement, naturally, a tiered system of who got to watch the blood sport up close and who got to squint from the rafters. The Emperor, of course, had the best view, probably with a nice cushion and a flunky to fan him. The commoners? Well, they got a taste of the spectacle, a chance to holler and throw rotten vegetables, a democratic moment in a decidedly undemocratic pastime. And you stand there, looking at the sand where so much… excitement transpired, and you can’t help but wonder if the ancient Romans weren't just a touch too fond of a good scrap. Makes you consider the relatively tame affairs of a modern boxing match. Though, I confess, I did once see a pie-eating contest in Sacramento that came close.

But here’s the rub, the genuine conundrum: You stand in the Coliseum, amidst all this ancient grandeur, and you realize that humanity, bless its eternally flawed soul, hasn't changed all that much. We still crave entertainment, we still enjoy a good contest, and we're still perfectly willing to pay good money to watch someone else get a bit of a walloping. Only difference now is we call it sports and sell it on pay-per-view. The Coliseum just did it with a touch more flair, a few more lions, and a whole lot less advertising. One has to wonder, don't you agree, if we have truly progressed or just put lipstick on a very old, very bloodthirsty pig.
