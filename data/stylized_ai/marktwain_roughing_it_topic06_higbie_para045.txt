Now, Higbie, that was a specimen for you! A ragged, onery, unkempt piece of humanity, he was. Looked like he'd been dragged backward through a thorny chaparral by a team of mules, and enjoyed the experience immensely. Wore a hat that had likely been sat on by a committee of hens, and a coat so patched it resembled a geographical survey of Nevada in cloth. He claimed to be a miner, mind you, which meant he spent most of his time either staring into a prospect hole deep enough to swallow a badger, or philosophizing on the best method to fry a rattlesnake. He had a vocabulary that could make a mule skinner blush, yet possessed a heart softer than a flour tortilla fresh off the griddle.

Higbie, bless his cotton socks, wasn't exactly overburdened with what you'd call "book larnin'." He could barely scribble his own name, but he could tell you the precise moment the sun would hit gold in a particular ravine, or sniff out a promising vein of silver from fifty paces. He possessed a logic all his own, a twisted, backwoods kind of reasoning that somehow, against all odds, usually landed him on the right side of the equation. He was a fella who'd argue that a leaky roof was a blessing because it reminded you to appreciate the sunshine, and then promptly blame you for the mildew growing on your boots.

He had stories, Higbie did. Tales of ghost towns and grizzlies, of fortunes won and lost quicker than a sneeze in a dust storm. Most likely exaggerated, of course, but entertaining enough to forgive the embellishments. He’d spin these yarns by the campfire, his eyes gleaming like nuggets fresh from the earth, whilst he whittled away at some piece of wood that never quite resembled anything identifiable. He was, in short, a walking, talking, tobacco-chewing embodiment of the West: rough around the edges, full of tall tales, and possessed of a peculiar charm that could disarm even the most hardened prospector. And despite his rough exterior and questionable hygiene, you couldn't help but feel a fondness for the old codger, for he was, in his own peculiar way, a genuine article, a pure, unadulterated piece of the Wild West, as genuine as a three-dollar bill but far more entertaining.
