Now, Harris, that fellow. Bless his heart, though I doubt the blessing would take, he’s a creature of habit, a sort of walking, talking timepiece, though one set perpetually five minutes fast, just to keep everyone on their toes, or more likely, to keep himself feeling perpetually put upon. You see, Harris believes the world is conspiring to make him late, a grand plot hatched solely to inconvenience him. He'd swear the traffic lights are sentient beings, turning red with malicious glee as his conveyance, usually some sputtering contraption smelling faintly of burnt toast and regret, approaches. He’ll recount, with the solemnity usually reserved for accounts of near-death experiences, how a rogue pebble, or a mischievous gust of wind, or the simple, unavoidable act of breathing air, conspired to add crucial seconds to his journey.

And his pronouncements! Lord have mercy, the man dispenses wisdom like a broken faucet dispenses drips. Every utterance is delivered with the gravity of Moses handing down the tablets, except Harris's tablets usually involve unsolicited advice on the proper way to prune a rose bush or the optimal angle for hanging a picture frame. He is, in essence, a fountain of common sense, which, as we all know, is the least common thing in the world. One suspects he reads those almanacs brimming with homespun remedies and farmer’s wisdom, internalizing them with an alarming fervor. He’ll then deploy this accumulated knowledge at the most inopportune moments, leaving you wondering if you’d accidentally wandered into a Victorian-era lecture hall instead of simply inquiring about the weather. Still, you can't entirely fault the man. He’s got a heart the size of a kumquat, though one occasionally feels the urge to pelt him with it. He’s just… well, Harris is Harris, a unique specimen of the human comedy, destined to perpetually fret and advise, leaving a trail of well-intentioned, if slightly irritating, pronouncements in his wake. And I reckon the world is just a tiny bit more interesting because of it, even if I do occasionally contemplate pushing him into the nearest duck pond.
