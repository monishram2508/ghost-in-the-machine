Winter in these here parts? Lord, it's a spectacle, and not the kind you'd pay good money to see, unless you’re partial to a good teeth-chattering. It ain't some dainty, powdered-sugar dusting like them folks back East yammer on about. No sir, our winter comes on like a drunken mule, kicking up a ruckus and leaving a mess in its wake. First, you notice the sky turning that peculiar shade of lead, like a prospector’s dreams gone bust, and the wind starts to howl like a banshee what's misplaced her dentures. Then comes the snow, not in delicate flakes, mind you, but great, lumbering chunks that look like they were hacked off a glacier with a dull axe.

And speaking of axes, you best have a good one handy, ‘cause you’ll be chopping wood till your arms feel like they belong to somebody else. The mercury? Well, it takes a notion to plumb the depths, dipping lower than a politician’s morals. You can practically hear the whiskey freezing in the bottle, and if you ain't careful, your mustache'll turn into a veritable icicle forest. Now, some folks claim they enjoy the “crisp, clean air” and the “stunning beauty” of a winter landscape. I reckon they're the same kind of folks who enjoy getting a tooth pulled without benefit of ether. Truth is, the only beauty I see is when the blamed thing finally thaws out, and the sun starts warming things up again. Until then, it’s a long, hard slog, best endured with a healthy dose of strong coffee, a thick buffalo robe, and the fervent hope that spring ain’t playing hooky this year. And if you hear anybody talkin’ ‘bout how much they love winter, just nod politely, and then slip them a bottle of cough syrup. They clearly ain't right in the head.
