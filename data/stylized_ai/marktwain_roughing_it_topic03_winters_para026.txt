Winter, now there's a subject ripe for exaggeration, wouldn't you agree? Out here in the territories, winter ain’t no gentle snowfall and cozy fireplace scene like them Eastern writers try to sell ya. It’s more like a grumpy old grizzly bear that’s decided to take up residence in your front yard and make a nuisance of itself. First, the wind starts howlin', a mournful sound like a coyote who’s just lost his last jackrabbit. It whips through the canyons and over the plains, carryin' snow that’s finer than a lady's powder and just as capable of gettin' in your eyes and makin' ya cry. Then comes the cold, the kind that sneaks into your bones and settles there, refusing to budge no matter how much whiskey you pour on the matter. You start to see men grow beards that could house a family of squirrels, just for the extra warmth.

Now, some folks claim they enjoy winter. Likely the same sort who claim they enjoy a good toothache. They'll tell you about the 'crisp air' and the 'sparkling landscape,' but I reckon they're just tryin' to put a good face on a bad situation. The crisp air, more like air sharp enough to shave with, and the sparkling landscape? Just frozen misery reflecting the dim winter sun. And the snow, why it's piled up so high, it makes your cabin look like a prairie dog’s burrow. Getting anywhere becomes an adventure in itself, involving snowshoes that are perpetually determined to trip you or a sled drawn by mules who possess all the enthusiasm of a condemned man. And the wildlife? Well, they either hibernate, looking sensible, or become ravenous and bold, eyeing you up as a possible snack. Truth be told, winter is nature's way of reminding us that she's still in charge, and we're just trespassers, tryin' to survive her temper tantrums. And Lord knows, her temper is a sight to behold, even if it does involve being frozen solid in the process.
