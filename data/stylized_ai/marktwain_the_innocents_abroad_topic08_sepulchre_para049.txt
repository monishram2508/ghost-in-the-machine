Now, a sepulchre, you see, is just a fancy word for a tomb, a final resting place for those who’ve shuffled off this mortal coil, as the Bard so eloquently put it. Though, I reckon Shakespeare never had to haggle with a stonemason about the price of a good, sturdy sarcophagus. Seems to me, these sepulchres come in all sorts of flavors, from the humble, grass-covered mound that wouldn't fool a fox, to those grandiose, marble mausoleums that practically scream, "Look at me! I was rich and important, and now I'm just a collection of bones, but still richer than you!" Human nature, ain’t it a curious thing? We spend our whole lives trying to accumulate earthly treasures, only to have them plunked down next to us, useless as a screen door on a submarine, when we're finally pushing up daisies.

I’ve seen sepulchres that are works of art, mind you – sculpted angels weeping over the departed, intricate carvings detailing the deceased's accomplishments, or at least what their family *thought* their accomplishments were. You always got to take those epitaphs with a grain of salt. I recall a tombstone, out West, proclaimed the dearly departed "A True and Honest Man." Now, I knew the fella, and he was about as honest as a three-dollar bill. I suspected his widow wrote it, likely feeling a pang of guilt for all the times she caught him skimming from the till. Then you get the ones that are just plain odd, you know? Like that fella who had himself buried inside a pyramid, claiming he was going to be resurrected like some pharaoh. Last I heard, he was still lying there, quiet as a church mouse, and looking considerably less impressive than Tutankhamun. All this sepulchre business just proves one thing: We're all a little vain, even in death. We want to leave a mark, a reminder that we were here, even if all it really proves is that we had the money to pay for a good stonemason. And after all is said and done, it’s just a hole in the ground with a fancy hat, isn’t it?
