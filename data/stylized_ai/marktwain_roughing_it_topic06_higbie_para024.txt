Higbie, now there was a specimen. A man carved, I reckon, from the very bedrock of the Sierras and polished smooth by a thousand dusty suns. You wouldn't catch him sporting a ruffled shirt or polishing his boots for any fancy-pants easterner; Higbie was too busy prospecting, a task he approached with the fervor of a starving grizzly bear chasing a honey pot. He claimed to have found more gold than Carter had pills, but I suspect half of it was buried in his own tall tales. Not that I begrudged him the fibs; a man’s got a right to embroider his life story a bit in these parts, especially if it involves dodging claim jumpers and outsmarting coyotes. His cabin, a ramshackle affair held together more by sheer stubbornness than proper carpentry, leaned precariously against a mountainside, threatening to slide into the ravine every winter. Inside, it smelled perpetually of burnt coffee and whatever varmint he'd recently tried to roast over the fire, an olfactory experience that would either knock you flat or cure your consumption, depending on your constitution.

Higbie’s luck, mind you, was a peculiar thing. He’d strike a rich vein one week, then lose it all the next playing poker with a card sharp who could shuffle a deck with his feet. He’d swear vengeance and declare his intention to become a reformed man, all the while winking knowingly and palming an extra ace. But that was Higbie; full of bluster and boasting, a perpetual optimist even when knee-deep in tailings and bad debts. He could charm a rattlesnake into lending him a coil for a rope, and he had the kind of grit that would shame a mule into pulling a heavier load. He was a walking, talking, gold-dust-dreaming caricature of the West, and I wouldn’t have traded him for a whole town full of sanctimonious preachers and prim schoolmarms. He was a scoundrel, sure, but he was *our* scoundrel, and in this wild, untamed corner of the world, that counted for something.
