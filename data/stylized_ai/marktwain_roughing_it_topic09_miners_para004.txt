Now, a miner. There's a specimen for ya, a study in grit and grime that'd make Darwin himself blush. He's a curious critter, the miner, generally found in the company of other miners, down in the earth's craw, which is a right uncomfortable place if you ask me. You’d think a fellow would be eager to spend his days under God's own sunshine, breathing in the fresh air, but no, not the miner. He's got a hankerin' for the dark, for the smell of blasting powder and damp earth, a peculiar taste if you ask me. He'll tell you he's chasing fortune, a glint of gold, a pocketful of silver, but I reckon half of 'em are just runnin' from their wives and mother-in-laws.

He's a hardy soul, mind you, built like a grizzly and twice as stubborn. He'll swing a pickax all day long, cussin' at the rock and prayin' for pay dirt. He'll drink whiskey like it's water, gamble away his earnings faster than you can say "jackpot," and then go right back down into that hole, beggin' for another chance. He ain't afraid of nothin', except maybe a dry diggins' and a closed saloon. And talk? Lord, can they talk. Tales of lost ledges, ghost towns, and nuggets the size of your fist – most of 'em taller than the Sierras, I swear.

He's superstitious, too, that miner. Wouldn't whistle in a tunnel for all the gold in California, swears it brings bad luck. He’ll carry a lucky charm, a rabbit's foot or a chunk of quartz, and he'll listen to the old-timers’ yarns with a respect you wouldn’t expect. He's a mix of foolhardiness and practicality, of faith and fatalism. He's a character, that's for sure, and though I wouldn't want to trade places with him, I'll tip my hat to him every time. He’s a piece of this wild, rough country, as essential as the mountains themselves, even if he’s spending his days tryin’ to tear ‘em down. He’s the backbone of this land, and the dirtiest part of it, all rolled into one grimy, gold-hungry package.
