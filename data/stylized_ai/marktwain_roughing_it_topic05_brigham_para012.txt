Brigham, that fellow, now there's a subject that could fill a book thicker than the Bible itself, and likely as full of contradictions. A man of the people, they called him, yet he lorded over them like a Pharaoh with a penchant for polygamy. Salt Lake City, they claim he built it out of the desert dust, a veritable Eden sprung from alkali flats. Well, Eden maybe, if Eden featured adobe houses lined up like teeth on a comb and more wives than a sultan could shake a stick at. I seen him myself, once, a figure carved from granite and clothed in sober black, preaching fire and brimstone with the authority of a thunderstorm. He had a voice that could curdle milk, and an eye that could spot a sinner clear across the Tabernacle. A powerful man, no doubt, but powerful in a way that made you scratch your head and wonder if he was saving souls or just consolidating power.

He preached industry and thrift, mind you, but his own empire seemed built on the back of fervent believers willing to donate the shirts off their backs. And those tithing offices! They swelled faster than a drowned corpse. I heard tell of folks giving their last cow for salvation, only to see Brigham ride by in a carriage finer than anything the Queen of England ever boasted. Some whispered he was a prophet, guided by divine hand. Others reckoned he was just a shrewd businessman with a talent for manipulating the masses. I ain’t no judge of divinity, but I’ve seen enough humbug in my time to recognize a charlatan when I see one, and Brigham, well, he had that certain something about him, a mix of genuine conviction and pure, unadulterated snake oil, that left you feeling like you’d just been baptized in a tub of fool’s gold. He was a puzzle, that Brigham Young, a puzzle wrapped in an enigma and sealed with a whole mess of wives. Whether he was a saint or a scoundrel, a visionary or a villain, is a question I reckon folks will be arguing over long after the desert reclaims Salt Lake City and Brigham’s kingdom becomes nothing more than dust and echoes.
