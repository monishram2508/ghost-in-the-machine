Now, about this bucksheesh, a word that rolls off the tongue like a stray date pit in the bazaars of the Orient, a term I’ve come to know intimately, perhaps a bit too intimately, during my own wanderings through those lands where the sun blazes and the palms sway, and the hands, oh, the hands are always outstretched. It’s a flexible thing, bucksheesh is, a sort of lubricant to smooth the cogs of daily existence, a sweetener for a transaction that might otherwise grind to a halt like a camel overloaded with carpets and brassware. One might call it a bribe, perhaps, and there are those stiff-necked moralists who would clutch their pearls at the mere mention of the word, as if the heavens might fall and rain down brimstone for such a transgression. But I say, ain’t most of life a species of bribery, just prettied up with fancy names like “influence” and “campaign contributions?"

You’ll find bucksheesh demanded at every turn. The fellow who guards the ancient ruins expects a little something to “look the other way” while you chip off a souvenir for your mantelpiece. The customs officer, he anticipates a trifling consideration to expedite your baggage, lest it be subjected to an interminable rummage through every nook and cranny. Even the humblest beggar, squatting in the dust with a wheedling voice, sees fit to request his share of the worldly spoils, though his claim is based on naught but the audacity of his destitution. It's a right comical affair, when you stop and consider, this universal expectation of a little something for nothin'. I once observed a donkey, after reluctantly carrying a rather corpulent tourist up a steep incline, stand fast and refuse to budge until the tourist relinquished a piece of his Turkish Delight. Now, I ask you, is that not the purest form of bucksheesh imaginable? And as for deciding the proper amount of bucksheesh, why that's an art in itself, a delicate dance between parsimony and practicality. Too little, and you’re met with scowls and delays. Too much, and you're marked as a simpleton ripe for further exploitation. So, tread carefully, friend, and remember the golden rule of bucksheesh: Always negotiate, and never, ever, show your hand until the very last moment.
