The term "pard," often shortened from "pardon," holds significant legal and social weight, representing the executive branch's prerogative to forgive an individual convicted of a crime. This act of clemency essentially nullifies the legal consequences of a conviction, restoring, to a considerable extent, the rights and privileges lost as a result of the crime. The power to grant pardons is typically vested in the head of state, such as a president or governor, and is rooted in the historical concept of royal prerogative, where monarchs possessed inherent authority to administer justice and dispense mercy.

The reasons behind granting a pardon can be varied. In some cases, it may be based on evidence of innocence that emerges after a conviction, effectively correcting a miscarriage of justice. In others, it might reflect a judgment that the individual has been sufficiently punished and has demonstrated genuine rehabilitation, making their continued legal stigma unnecessary or detrimental. Furthermore, pardons can be issued for broader policy reasons, such as promoting reconciliation after periods of social unrest or addressing perceived inequalities in the criminal justice system. The political ramifications of a pardon are often substantial, requiring careful consideration of public opinion, the nature of the crime, and the potential impact on victims and their families.

The process for obtaining a pardon generally involves a formal application to a designated board or agency, often comprised of legal professionals and community representatives. This body reviews the applicant's criminal history, personal circumstances, and any supporting documentation, such as letters of recommendation or evidence of remorse and reform. Their findings are then presented to the executive authority, who ultimately decides whether to grant or deny the pardon. It is important to note that a pardon does not erase the record of the crime itself; it simply removes the legal penalties associated with it. Therefore, the conviction will still appear on background checks, although it will be noted that a pardon has been granted. The granting of a pard is a discretionary act and it is not required. The executive branch has the authority to provide the pardon and in most places there is not a way to legally force the executive branch to grant a pardon.
