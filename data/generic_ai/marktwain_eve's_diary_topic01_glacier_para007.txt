A glacier, often described as a river of ice, is a massive, persistent body of ice formed from the accumulation and compaction of snow. These icy giants sculpt landscapes over vast stretches of time, acting as both agents of erosion and deposition. Their formation begins in areas where snowfall consistently exceeds melting, leading to the gradual buildup of snow layers. With each passing season, new snow compresses the older layers beneath, increasing the density. Eventually, the pressure transforms the snow into granular ice, and further compaction creates dense, bluish glacial ice. The immense weight of this ice mass causes it to deform and flow slowly downhill or outward under the force of gravity.

Glaciers can range in size from small cirque glaciers, nestled in mountain bowls, to expansive ice sheets that cover entire continents, like those in Antarctica and Greenland. As they move, glaciers carve out valleys, leaving behind distinctive U-shaped formations. The grinding action of the ice, often laden with rocks and debris, erodes the underlying bedrock, creating striations, grooves, and polished surfaces. This process also generates vast quantities of sediment, ranging from fine silt to large boulders, which are transported within, on top, or beneath the glacier. When the glacier melts, it deposits this sediment, forming features such as moraines, eskers, and outwash plains. Moraines are ridges of unsorted sediment deposited at the glacier's margins or terminus, while eskers are sinuous ridges of sediment deposited by meltwater streams flowing within or beneath the ice. Outwash plains are broad, flat areas of sediment deposited by meltwater streams flowing away from the glacier's terminus.

The movement of a glacier is influenced by several factors, including the ice thickness, slope of the underlying terrain, temperature, and the presence of meltwater. Meltwater at the base of the glacier can lubricate the interface between the ice and the bedrock, allowing the glacier to slide more rapidly. This phenomenon, known as basal sliding, is particularly important in temperate glaciers. Glaciers play a crucial role in the Earth's climate system, storing vast quantities of freshwater and reflecting solar radiation back into space. However, with the increasing global temperatures, many glaciers are shrinking at an alarming rate, contributing to sea-level rise and altering water availability in many regions. The loss of glacial ice has far-reaching consequences, impacting ecosystems, water resources, and human populations that depend on these icy reservoirs.
