Harris, now there’s a specimen fit for a naturalist’s notebook, though I suspect even Darwin himself might scratch his head a bit at the evolutionary puzzle presented. He's one of those fellows seemingly born with an inherent talent for complicating the simplest of affairs, like trying to thread a needle with boxing gloves on. Why, I recall one time we were attempting a leisurely paddle down the Thames, a perfectly straightforward affair, you'd think, even a blockhead could manage it. But no, not with Harris aboard. He insisted on packing enough provisions for a polar expedition, including a ham the size of a baby elephant and enough tea to float a battleship. Then, while attempting to navigate a particularly scenic bend, he managed to snag our towrope on a passing barge, which proceeded to drag us upstream at a velocity that threatened to tear the very oars from their sockets. He swore blind it was the barge's fault, naturally, claiming they were deliberately trying to ruin his day. Ruin his day! As if the sun, moon, and stars hadn’t already conspired to that effect.

And his organizational skills, bless his heart, are something to behold. He’s the sort who’d meticulously catalogue a haystack, only to lose the needle in the process. I’ve seen him unpack a carpetbag and somehow manage to pack more back in than he took out – a feat that would make a magician green with envy. It's a mystery how he ties his shoes in the morning, I tell you. And yet, despite his proclivity for turning molehills into mountains of mayhem, he's a decent enough chap, in a frustrating, head-scratching kind of way. He means well, I suppose, it's just that his well-meaning often ends up resembling a full-scale catastrophe. It's like watching a benevolent bull in a china shop – you admire the sentiment, but you keep a safe distance, just in case. He's a reminder that life is rarely as simple as it seems, and that even the most well-intentioned efforts can end up in a glorious, comedic mess. And after all, what's life without a bit of a mess, eh? Just a dull, predictable affair, and Heaven forbid we should suffer that fate.
