Chamonix, they call it. A village tucked into the bosom of the Alps like a babe clinging to its mother, only instead of milk, this babe guzzles down the gassy fumes of ambition and postcard dreams. One arrives expecting a quaint, rustic simplicity, perhaps the echoing song of a yodeler and the comforting clatter of cowbells. What one finds, alas, is a bustling marketplace of anxieties, each face etched with the desperate desire to either conquer Mont Blanc or at least be photographed looking as if they *could* conquer Mont Blanc, given a slightly better breakfast and a less bothersome bunion. The air, thin as a pauper's excuse, hums with the whir of cable cars, dangling humanity like so many overripe plums above the dizzying chasm. These contraptions, marvels of engineering I suppose, but looking for all the world like rickety cages designed by a slightly inebriated watchmaker. And the tourists! Lord save us from the tourists! They come in droves, clad in garments so vibrant they could shame a rainbow, each one convinced they are channeling the spirit of some long-dead mountaineering hero. I observed one fellow, sporting a beard that would make a mountain goat envious, attempting to photograph a particularly picturesque patch of snow. He consulted his device with the solemnity of a bishop reading scripture, finally snapping a picture, then immediately adjusting his jaunty hat and striking a pose that suggested he had single-handedly carved the very glacier he was standing upon. The whole affair smacked of the theatrical, a grand performance for an audience of fleeting clouds and disapproving marmots. And yet, despite the clamor and the charade, there's a certain undeniable charm to Chamonix. It's a stage, yes, a stage upon which humanity attempts to outshine the mountains themselves. And perhaps, just perhaps, in their ludicrous attempts to do so, they stumble upon something approaching genuine wonder. Or, at the very least, a decent fondue.
