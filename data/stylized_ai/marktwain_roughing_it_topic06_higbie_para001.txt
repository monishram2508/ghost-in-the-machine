Higbie, now there was a specimen ripe for the plucking, though not necessarily of precious metals, mind you. More like a ripe, over-burdened pear, ready to drop from the branch of common sense and splatter against the unforgiving sidewalk of reality. A man of boundless enthusiasm, I’ll give him that, and a constitution apparently forged in the fires of boundless optimism. He believed, did Higbie, that fortune lay just around the next bend, glittering brighter than a widow’s tears at a poker table. Trouble was, his sense of direction was about as reliable as a politician’s promise. He could lead you into a blind alley faster than a greased pig at a county fair, all the while assuring you, with a gleam in his eye, that paradise awaited just beyond that pile of refuse.

He was a carpenter by trade, or at least claimed to be. I suspect his carpentry consisted mostly of whittling away at whatever wood he could find while regaling passersby with tales of his impending wealth. His finished projects, if they could be called that, tended to resemble abstract sculptures more than functional furniture. A chair built by Higbie, for instance, might possess a leaning posture that hinted at existential weariness, or a table leg that bore a striking resemblance to a disgruntled badger. 

He wasn't a bad sort, Higbie, just… misplaced. Like a banjo in a church, or a teetotaler at a saloon. He saw potential where others saw only dust and desolation, a quality admirable in its own daft way. He’d pick up a broken horseshoe, polish it with his sleeve, and declare it a sign of good fortune, even as he tripped over a rusty shovel, sending a cascade of loose gravel down the hillside. You couldn't help but chuckle at him, really. He was a walking, talking embodiment of the fool’s gold that lured so many souls to these parts. He chased rainbows while standing knee-deep in mud, and yet, there was a certain charm in his persistence, a naive faith that maybe, just maybe, a bit of magic still lingered in this godforsaken land. Whether that magic would ever translate into tangible riches for Higbie remained, and likely still remains, a question best left to the gods, or perhaps a particularly savvy fortune teller with a keen eye for the gullible.
