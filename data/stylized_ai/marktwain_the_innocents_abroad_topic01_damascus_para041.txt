Damascus, bless its ancient heart, is a city that’ll try the patience of a saint, or perhaps a camel with a sand-burr under its tail. Imagine, if you will, a place where dust reigns supreme, a benevolent despot showering his affection equally upon the donkey carts, the bejeweled merchants, and the hapless tourist fumbling with his Baedeker. They call it the “City of Jasmine,” and while I’ll grant you a whiff or two of the fragrant blossom now and then, mostly you get a noseful of donkey droppings and the acrid bite of charcoal braziers. The streets, mind you, are a labyrinth designed, I suspect, by a committee of mischievous djinn with a fondness for practical jokes. Turn left, you’re in a spice market fragrant enough to wake the dead; turn right, you’re facing a wall of impenetrable concrete that seems to have sprouted overnight. 

And the bartering! Oh, the bartering! You’d think a man was trying to chisel the Taj Mahal out of a miser’s clenched fist. A trinket that back home would fetch a dime requires the negotiation skills of a diplomat, the cunning of a fox, and the vocal stamina of a town crier. You'll spend half a day haggling over a brass teapot, only to discover it leaks like a sieve when you try to make tea. But then again, what’s life without a little tribulation? 

The people, now, they are a curious lot. Some are as sly as the aforementioned fox, others as generous as the desert sun. You might find yourself cheated out of a few piasters, but then you'll be invited for tea and endless conversation by a stranger who hasn’t two pennies to rub together. It's a city of contrasts, I tell you, a place where the sacred and the profane rub shoulders like old friends at a crowded tavern. You leave Damascus with a lighter wallet, a heavier heart (burdened with memories both grand and exasperating), and a profound appreciation for the simple virtues of a clean, paved street. But you’ll also leave with a story or two, guaranteed to make your friends back home think you’ve finally gone round the bend, and isn’t that, after all, the true measure of a successful journey?
