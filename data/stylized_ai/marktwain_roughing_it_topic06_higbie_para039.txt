Higbie, now there was a specimen, a human curiosity fit for Barnum’s own museum, though not quite as hairy as the Wild Man of Borneo, mind you. Higbie was a man whose pockets were perpetually empty, save for lint and maybe a stray grasshopper or two, yet he carried himself with the air of a Rothschild who’d misplaced his counting house. He was a miner, of sorts, though I reckon a badger had more luck unearthing silver. He fancied himself a judge of ore, could tell you the precise value of a rock by merely squinting at it with one eye closed and the other looking suspiciously like a boiled egg. Of course, he was usually wrong, so his judgment was about as reliable as a weather forecast in a sandstorm.

Higbie had a philosophy, though whether he borrowed it, stole it, or invented it while chasing dust devils, I couldn't rightly say. It revolved around the notion that patience, coupled with copious amounts of luck, was the key to untold riches. He'd sit for hours on a claim, whittling away at a stick and pondering the mysteries of the universe, or more likely, wondering if he’d packed enough beans for supper. He was always about to strike it rich, always on the verge of uncovering a motherlode so vast it would shame the Comstock. He was a walking, talking, breathing “almost,” forever teetering on the brink of becoming a millionaire, but never quite making the leap. He’d tell you about his grand plans, how he was going to build a mansion with a fountain made of gold and pave his driveway with diamonds the size of walnuts. Meanwhile, he was sleeping in a tent patched with flour sacks and eating beans out of a tin can.

Yet, somehow, you couldn’t help but like the fella. He was as honest as a Nevada sidewinder, and just as likely to lead you astray. He never intentionally cheated a soul, unless you counted his overestimation of ore value. He was a dreamer, a romantic in a land of hardscrabble pragmatists, and in his own peculiar way, he brought a certain spark of absurdity to the otherwise drab existence of a Western mining town. He was a fool, perhaps, but a good-natured one, and I suspect that deep down, he knew his gold-paved dreams were nothing more than fool's gold. But he was too polite to admit it, and too busy searching for the real thing.
