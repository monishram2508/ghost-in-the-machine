Heidelberg, bless its romantic heart, is a town fairly bursting with charm, so much so one wonders if the very cobblestones aren’t lacquered with sentimentality and polished thrice daily by lovesick students. The castle, perched atop the hill like a majestic but slightly dilapidated cuckoo clock, is quite the sight, or rather, was quite the sight, before the French thought it needed “improving” with a goodly application of gunpowder. Now, it stands a picturesque ruin, a testament to the destructive power of Gallic enthusiasm and the persistent appeal of a good explosion. One can clamber about the ruins, picturing oneself as a knight of old, dodging imaginary arrows and swatting at nonexistent dragons, though in truth, dodging the swarms of tourists wielding selfie sticks is a far greater and more present danger. And those students! Oh, those students, swarming the Hauptstrasse like bees to honey, their faces flushed with beer and youthful folly, singing songs that sound remarkably like yodeling, and engaging in conversations that, judging from the earnestness of their expressions, concern matters of the utmost philosophical importance, even if one suspects it's only a heated debate over which wurst is superior. Then there's the famous Tun, the world’s largest wine barrel, which holds enough wine to drown half the population of Baden, should one be so inclined. Why anyone would need such an enormous receptacle for grape juice remains a mystery, a question that even the learned professors of the university – who, incidentally, sport beards that could house small birds – cannot seem to adequately answer. One suspects it was built simply because it could be, a monument to Teutonic ambition and a healthy appreciation for a good tipple. Altogether, Heidelberg is a pleasant spot, though perhaps a bit too saccharine for the truly cynical soul. But even I, hardened and world-weary as I am, must admit to finding a certain charm in its quaintness, even if it makes one feel a tad like a sugar plum fairy lost in a forest of gingerbread houses.
