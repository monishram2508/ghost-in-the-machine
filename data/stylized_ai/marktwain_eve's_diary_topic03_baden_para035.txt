Baden, ah, Baden! They call it Baden-Baden, as if doubling down on the Baden-ness might somehow make it more… Baden. It's a place where Grand Dukes with names you can’t pronounce came to sweat out their sins in bubbling, stinky water, a practice which, to my mind, smells more of sulfur and less of salvation. One expects, at any moment, to see them emerge, dripping and rejuvenated, only to promptly lose their regained virtue at the nearest roulette table. It's a town draped in velvet, powdered with pretension, and stuffed to the gills with retired colonels boasting of imaginary military campaigns. The air hangs heavy with the scent of floral perfume trying valiantly to mask the faint, lingering odour of boiled eggs and regret. The women, bless their bejeweled souls, parade about in gowns fit for a coronation, though the only throne they’re likely to occupy is a padded chair in the Kurhaus, strategically positioned for optimum eavesdropping.

The architecture, a gaudy symphony of rococo swirls and gilded cherubs, seems designed to overwhelm the senses and numb the mind, a sort of decorative chloroform. I swear I once saw a cupid wink at me, or perhaps it was just the fumes from the hot springs finally taking their toll. Even the trees appear to stand taller and straighter, as if acutely aware of the social hierarchy. And the conversations, oh, the conversations! Dripping with diamond-studded pronouncements and the clinking of porcelain teacups. One hears whispers of scandalous affairs, financial ruin, and the agonizing choice between caviar or foie gras for breakfast. The whole enterprise seems a desperate attempt to cling to a fading grandeur, like an old dowager clutching a tattered silk fan. One feels a bit like an anthropologist observing a peculiar tribe engaging in elaborate rituals, only instead of feathers and face paint, they have priceless jewels and ridiculously oversized hats. I found myself, quite naturally, drawn to the nearest beer garden. At least the beer didn't pretend to be something it wasn't.
