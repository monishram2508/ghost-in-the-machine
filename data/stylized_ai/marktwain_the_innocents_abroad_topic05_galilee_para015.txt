The Galilee, they call it, and a right curious place it is, a farrago of fertile fields and stony hills, much like a rummage sale after a particularly disastrous picnic. They say the Sea of Galilee is a ‘sea,’ mind you, but I reckon it's more of a large puddle with delusions of grandeur. Pretty enough, I suppose, if you're partial to bodies of water that a particularly ambitious duck could swim across in a morning. The shores are crowded with villages, little huddles of houses that seem determined to lean into the landscape like old gossips sharing secrets. Tiberias, ah, that's a town with a reputation! Built by Herod, no doubt with all the charm and subtlety that that particular family was known for – think over-gilded furniture in a peasant's cottage. And the stories they tell about this place! Miracles and whatnot, fishermen pulling in nets bursting with fish that would make a cat grin from ear to ear, and a fellow walking on water. Now, I've seen a lot of things in my day, but a man traipsing across a lake without the aid of a boat or a particularly buoyant log? Well, I'll believe it when I see a pig fly, and even then, I'll suspect some trickery.

The folks who live here, they're a sturdy lot, tanned by the sun and smelling perpetually of fish and olives. They’ll sell you a rug or a trinket with the enthusiasm of a revival preacher, and you’ll be hard pressed to tell whether they’re genuinely pious or just remarkably good salesmen. But there’s a certain honesty to them, a grit in their character that you won't find in the fancier towns. They live close to the land, and the land, bless its rocky soul, keeps them humble. And the food, well, the food is another matter entirely. Forget your fancy French sauces and delicate pastries. Here, it's all about hearty, honest flavors, things that stick to your ribs like a guilty conscience. Fresh fish grilled over an open fire, olives glistening with oil, bread baked in earth ovens – a feast fit for a king, or at least a hungry tourist who’s had enough of looking at dusty ruins and questionable miracles. You won’t find elegance here, mind you, but you’ll find something real, something that sticks with you long after you’ve shaken the dust of the Galilee from your boots.
