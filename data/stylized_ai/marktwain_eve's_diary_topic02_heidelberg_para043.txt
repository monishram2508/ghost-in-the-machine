Heidelberg, bless its romantic old heart, is a town so ridiculously picturesque, it makes one suspect the Almighty, in a fit of whimsy, decided to play at diorama-making. One half expects little clockwork figures to emerge from the castle ruins on the hour, yodeling and waving tiny steins of beer. Indeed, the castle itself, a magnificent, crumbling behemoth of red sandstone, sits perched upon the hillside like a tipsy monarch after a particularly robust feast. It's been battered by war and lightning and, I daresay, the sheer weight of its own grandeur, yet it still manages to maintain a pretense of aristocratic dignity. One can almost hear the ghosts of long-dead princes whispering scandalous secrets through the echoing halls, tales of courtly intrigue and, no doubt, the occasional ill-advised dalliance with a saucy kitchen maid. 

Then there's the Neckar river, a languid ribbon of green winding through the valley, so impossibly clean and serene it practically begs for a painting. Young lovers stroll along its banks, hand in hand, gazing into each other's eyes with an intensity that would curdle milk, no doubt reciting saccharine poetry about eternal devotion. One almost feels compelled to cough pointedly, reminding them that even the most ardent love affairs eventually succumb to the harsh realities of leaky roofs and unpaid bills. And the students! Oh, the students, with their perpetually rumpled clothing and their heads filled with lofty ideas about reforming the world whilst simultaneously trying to decipher Hegel. They throng the streets, clutching books and pipes, debating existential quandaries with the fervor of religious zealots arguing over the proper length of an angel's wing. One suspects they spend more time philosophizing in beer gardens than actually attending lectures, but who am I to judge? After all, isn't a little intellectual idleness the very essence of youth? Heidelberg, you see, is a place where the past and present mingle in a delightful, slightly absurd, and thoroughly charming fashion. One can't help but be captivated, even if one suspects it's all a cleverly staged illusion.
