Morgan, now there was a specimen. A regular sidewinder in a frock coat, I tell you what. Found him out in Nevada Territory, prospecting, or at least claiming to be. More like prospecting for opportunities to lighten a fella’s poke, if you asked me. Wore a hat that looked like a badger had taken up residence, and a beard that could shelter a family of field mice. He talked a blue streak, Morgan did, a regular Niagara of blarney, enough to drown a politician in his own sweat. Claimed he was kin to J. Pierpont himself, mind you. “Distantly related, of course,” he’d say, tilting that badger hat, “but blood’s thicker than water, especially when gold’s involved.”

He was always concocting some scheme, some harebrained invention or land deal that was just shy of striking it rich. One time he tried to convince a bunch of Paiute Indians to invest in a perpetual motion machine powered by tumbleweeds. Lord, the look on their faces. Another time, he “discovered” a lost Roman city in Death Valley. Turns out it was just a collection of curiously shaped rocks and his own vivid imagination fueled by rotgut whiskey.

But you couldn't help but like the old coot. He possessed a certain…well, call it audacious charm. Like a mangy dog that’s just so darn happy to see you, even if you know he’s probably going to try and steal your dinner. He was a walking, talking tall tale, a living embodiment of the American West's glorious con. A fella could lose his shirt to Morgan, sure, but he’d also get a good story out of it. And in this life, friend, sometimes a good story is worth more than all the gold in the Comstock Lode. Though, I wouldn’t advise loaning him any cash; you might as well throw it down a mineshaft and hope for a miracle.
