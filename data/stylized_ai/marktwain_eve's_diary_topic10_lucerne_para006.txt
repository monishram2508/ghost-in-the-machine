Lucerne, bless her heart, is a town that knows how to put on airs, same as a fop in freshly starched linens. Why, you’d think the Alps themselves were arranged just so, to show off that shimmering lake to its best advantage. The tourists, bless their innocent souls, arrive in droves, clinging to their Baedekers like they held the very secrets of the universe. They’re utterly convinced Lucerne’s something special, something *authentic*. And perhaps it is, in its own way, like a meticulously crafted stage set feels “authentic” while the actors are strutting and bellowing. The Lion Monument, now that’s a piece of work. Carved into the rock face, a poor lion, mortally wounded, and looking for all the world like he’s just misplaced his spectacles and is desperately trying to find them. They say it commemorates the Swiss Guards who died during the French Revolution, but I reckon it’s more likely a commentary on the sheer indignity of death, or maybe the eternal hunt for lost spectacles. You take your pick. Then there’s the Chapel Bridge, longer than a Sunday sermon, painted with pictures that’d make a saint blush, and decorated with geraniums that smell sweet as springtime. It’s all very picturesque, very charming, very…well, Swiss. Which is to say, expensive. A fellow can hardly sneeze without finding himself paying for the privilege of breathing the air. I swear, the shopkeepers there must think money grows on trees. And maybe it does, for them, considering the prices they charge for a cuckoo clock that probably tells the wrong time anyway. But there I go, judging. Lucerne is what it is, a prettified postcard come to life, and who am I to begrudge folks their pleasure, even if they are paying a king’s ransom for it? Besides, the beer ain't half bad, and sometimes, just sometimes, the sunset over the lake makes you forget all about the expense and the pretension, and remember why folks are drawn to pretty things, like moths to a flickering flame.
