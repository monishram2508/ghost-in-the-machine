Naples, ah, Naples! A city so ripe with contradictions it could make a philosopher weep with laughter and a saint consider a life of piracy. I tell you, the place is a veritable opera, played out in the dust and sunshine, with a cast of thousands yelling their lines over the din of sputtering Vespas and the bleating of goats (yes, goats! I swear I saw one tethered to a lamppost, looking for all the world like he was waiting for the curtain to rise). One expects, at any moment, for a tenor to burst forth from a trattoria, his voice trembling with passion over a lost love and a plate of spaghetti. The streets, narrow and labyrinthine, are a chaotic ballet performed by handcarts piled high with oranges, old women draped in black shawls dispensing wisdom (or curses, depending on your tipping habits), and street urchins whose eyes gleam with an intelligence that suggests they've already outwitted Machiavelli.

The city reeks, mind you, of everything imaginable – a heady perfume of frying garlic, diesel fumes, and the briny tang of the sea, all blended together in a concoction that either assaults or delights, depending on whether you've had breakfast. And the laundry! Good heavens, the laundry! It hangs from every window, a vibrant tapestry of domesticity stretched across the crumbling facades of ancient buildings, like pennants celebrating some glorious, albeit slightly rumpled, victory. One might think the Neapolitans own stock in the clothesline industry, for they certainly seem determined to keep it afloat, along with the myth that cleanliness is next to godliness. Though, in Naples, I suspect God might have to settle for a spot further down the list, somewhere after family, football, and the proper preparation of a pizza margherita. It’s a noisy, dusty, vibrant, maddening place, Naples, and one leaves it feeling like one has just narrowly escaped being run over by a donkey cart carrying a politician – a feeling, I might add, not entirely unpleasant.
