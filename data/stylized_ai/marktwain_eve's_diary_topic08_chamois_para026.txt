And then there was the Chamois. Oh, my, the Chamois! It appears a creature dreamed up by a bored god on a Tuesday afternoon. Imagine, if you will, a goat – but not your common, garden-variety goat content with munching tin cans behind the barn. No, this goat fancies itself an alpinist, a daredevil of the dizzying heights. It has little horns, rather like my own coiffure after a particularly spirited thunderstorm, that hook backward as if perpetually surprised by the view. A view, I might add, that would send shivers down the spine of even the most seasoned tightrope walker, the Chamois takes in stride, nay, with a blithe indifference that verges on arrogance.

They inhabit the mountains, those precarious, jagged places where one misstep means a rather abrupt and unpleasant farewell to gravity. You'd think they would be careful, these creatures, but they leap about those cliffs with a confidence bordering on lunacy. I swear, I saw one once, perched on a ledge so narrow it could barely accommodate a teacup, gazing down at the abyss with a look that suggested he was considering a more dramatic route for his descent – perhaps a triple backflip with a twist? And their coloring! A sort of tawny brown, not unlike a fashionable autumn gown, but then splashed with patches of white that seem entirely random. It’s as if the Almighty, having created a perfectly respectable mountain goat, decided at the last minute to spill a bucket of whitewash on it, just for the sheer devilry of it all. They’re not entirely unpleasant to look at, mind you, but their utter disregard for sensible living does give one pause. I suspect they laugh at us down below, huddled in our warm houses, worrying about things like the weather or the proper way to address a visiting dignitary. They are, without a doubt, the rapscallions of the animal kingdom, living proof that some creatures are simply born to tempt fate and make a respectable woman question her life choices. Truly, a creature worthy of both admiration and utter bewilderment.
