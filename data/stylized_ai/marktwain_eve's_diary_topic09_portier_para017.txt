Now, about this portier, this draping, this glorified curtain they dangle in doorways. Seems to me, it's another one of man’s fool contraptions designed to complicate the simple things of life. In the Garden, a vine did the job admirably, shielding us from the sun's impertinence, offering a measure of privacy when Adam was wrestling with his conscience after the apple episode. But no, that’s not ornate enough for these modern fellas! They must have velvet, and tassels, and embroidered scenes of, heavens to Betsy, hunting parties!

I observe that the chief purpose of this portier is to collect dust, much like Adam’s collection of petrified leaves. It hangs there, a silent sentinel, accumulating the world’s grime and harboring creatures best left unnamed. A spider, I warrant, has taken up residence behind mine, probably plotting to trap poor butterflies. I dare not look too closely, fearing I'll discover a whole civilization thriving in its musty depths. Imagine, little dust-mites, building grand cities within the folds, holding elaborate court, and judging my taste in interior decoration. The thought alone gives me the vapors!

And consider the noise! A simple door, it swings open with a civil creak. But a portier? It whispers and sighs, rustles and murmurs, like a gathering of gossiping spirits discussing my dress sense. It clings to one’s garments like a lovesick barnacle, leaving behind a trail of lint and suspicion. Adam, bless his heart, once tried to swing through it like Tarzan, resulting in a torn tapestry and a very bruised dignity. The servants took to calling it “The Barrier of Betrayal” after that incident. Honestly, a draughty room seems preferable to the theatrical melodrama this portier perpetuates. I suspect the purpose of the portier is not to block drafts, but to give oneself the opportunity to make a dramatic entrance. Which, come to think of it, is something I might try after all.
