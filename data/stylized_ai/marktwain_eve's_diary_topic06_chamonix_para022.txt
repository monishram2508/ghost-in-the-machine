Ah, Chamonix! They call it the capital of Alpinism, do they? Which is to say, a place where men, and a handful of daring women, attempt to prove Darwin wrong by deliberately throwing themselves at the pointy end of the earth. The air up there, thin as a debutante's sensibilities, does peculiar things to a body. One moment you're admiring the view – and I confess, it's a spectacle fit to make an angel weep with envy – the next you're considering whether your boots are a better investment than life insurance. The town itself? A curious concoction, like a Swiss cuckoo clock that's been drinking absinthe. Guesthouses stand cheek-to-jowl with shops peddling enough rope and carabiners to ensnare the entire population of Philadelphia.

The inhabitants, a mix of earnest climbers with sun-leathered faces and tourists who look as though they'd faint at the sight of a moderately sized hill, provide endless amusement. One can sit at a café – preferably with a fortification of strong coffee laced with something a bit more persuasive – and watch them. The climbers stride by with the grim determination of men facing a firing squad, while the tourists snap photos of mountains they wouldn't dare approach closer than a postcard. One suspects half of them are there to brag about their proximity to danger, not to actually experience it. And the dining, heavens! Fondue, everywhere fondue! One wonders if the cows in this region are secretly resentful, their milk being so relentlessly weaponized. It's a wonder anyone manages to leave Chamonix without acquiring a cheese-induced waddle and an unshakeable conviction that they've conquered something, even if it's only a particularly challenging cheese board. All in all, a quaint little spot, Chamonix; though if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll stick to admiring its snow-capped majesty from the relative safety of a newspaper photograph.
