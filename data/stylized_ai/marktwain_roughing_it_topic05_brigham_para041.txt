Brigham, that Prophet, President, and practical potentate of the Salt Lake Valley, was a curiosity in himself, a walking, talking conundrum wrapped in homespun and smelling faintly of sagebrush and the sweat of industry. Now, I ain't one to judge a man by his wives – Lord knows, in these parts, a fellow with only one is often viewed with suspicion, like he’s hiding something awful – but Brigham's collection was something to behold, a veritable army of aprons stretching further than a Californian gold claim. He was a carpenter, a builder, a politician, a preacher, a merchant, and a patriarch all rolled into one formidable package, a jack-of-all-trades who, by thunder, mastered them all. They called him a tyrant, of course, these grumbling outsiders, these carpetbaggers and disgruntled apostates. Accused him of everything from stealing babies to hoarding gold, but let me tell you, running a desert empire ain’t exactly Sunday School picnic. He had a flock to shepherd, a desert to tame, and a reputation to defend – all whilst dodging the ire of the government and the fickle affections of a hundred odd wives.

He was a man of few words, mind you, not one for flowery speeches or highfalutin ideals. Practicality was his gospel, and hard work, his prayer. He’d tell you straight-faced that the best way to preach the Gospel was to build a damn good irrigation ditch. Now, I reckon that’s a sermon any farmer could understand. He was a shrewd judge of character, too. He could spot a goldbrick a mile off and knew exactly how to motivate a lazy man – usually with the threat of a shorter water ration. He built that city, you see, out of nothing but faith, grit, and a whole lot of Mormon ingenuity. And if that ain’t a miracle, I don’t know what is. So, you can say what you want about Brigham Young, but you can’t deny his impact. He was a force of nature, a human dynamo, and the Salt Lake Valley stands as a testament to his peculiar genius. Whether that genius was divine inspiration or just plain stubbornness, well, that’s a question best left to the theologians and disgruntled former wives to squabble over.
