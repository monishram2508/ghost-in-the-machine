The Neckar, bless her heart, isn't quite the Mississippi, you understand. No sir, she ain't got the breadth or the bluster, nor the alligators, for that matter, which I always thought were a fine touch. She's more of a lady, you see, demure and winding, like a ribbon dropped carelessly by a debutante on her way to a waltz. We steamed up her waters aboard a vessel that probably saw its better days before Kaiser Wilhelm started twirling his mustache. Heidelberg Castle, perched like a grumpy old eagle atop a crag, gave us the side-eye as we passed. Probably thinking we were a rabble, which, truth be told, we were. I observed a fellow traveler, a portly German gent with whiskers that could ensnare a small bird, diligently photographing every blasted vineyard we encountered. You'd think he'd never seen a grapevine before, which is likely, seeing as how he spent most of the voyage draped over a sausage and a stein of beer. The riverbanks, oh, they were a riot of color, little storybook villages clinging to the hillsides like barnacles to a hull. Each one boasting a church steeple sharper than a wit's tongue and more half-timbered houses than you could shake a crooked stick at. And the bridges! My heavens, they spanned the river with such audacious grace, you’d swear they were showing off. Now, they say the Neckar's a romantic river, inspiring poets and lovers to scribble verses and whisper sweet nothings. But I mostly observed folks swatting at gnats and complaining about the price of beer. Which, I suppose, is its own sort of poetry, in a rough-hewn, down-to-earth sort of way. But don’t let my cynicism sour you, dear reader. The Neckar's got charm, I’ll give her that. A quiet, unassuming charm that creeps up on you like a summer cold. Just don't expect her to roar. She prefers to murmur. And that, I reckon, is perfectly agreeable.
