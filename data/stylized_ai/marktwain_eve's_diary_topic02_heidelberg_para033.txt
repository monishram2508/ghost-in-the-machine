Heidelberg, they call it a university town, which is a bit like calling the Atlantic a rather damp puddle, you see. It's a town so crammed with scholars and students that one can scarcely toss a cobblestone without hitting a future professor, or a poet lamenting the transience of beer foam. The castle, perched atop the hill like a tipsy monarch wearing a crumbled crown, lords over the Neckar river with a weary grandeur. It’s a magnificent ruin, I confess, but so enormous that one spends half the day climbing its staircases, only to discover that the view is remarkably similar to the one you left behind – a charming vista of rooftops and chimney pots, all painted in shades of perpetual twilight thanks to the perpetually misty weather.

The Germans, bless their methodical souls, have even catalogued every single love poem ever scratched into the castle walls by lovesick students, which, I’m quite certain, is a project only slightly less tedious than counting the number of grains of sand on a beach. The student prison, though, that's a story! These fellows, apparently, were so fond of dueling and other such raucous entertainments that they were occasionally incarcerated for a few days. And what did they do? Why, they decorated their cells with the most appalling artwork imaginable, depicting, I gather, scenes of riotous drinking and general malfeasance. One gets the distinct impression they rather enjoyed their imprisonment, viewing it as a sort of exclusive club for unruly academics. The whole place, I must say, has a certain charm, a sort of dignified dilapidation that suggests a past of great intellect and even greater revelry. Just don't expect to find any decent plumbing within those ancient walls, or a dry pair of shoes, for that matter. One must suffer for art, you know, and Heidelberg provides ample opportunity for both the creation and the endurance of discomfort.
