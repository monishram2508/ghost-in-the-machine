Harris, now there's a specimen. He's the sort that looks perpetually surprised to be still drawing breath, though the Lord only knows why He'd bother keeping him around. I suspect it's for the amusement of the angels, a cosmic practical joke played upon the celestial spheres. He's got a face like a squashed pudding and a mind to match, foggy and prone to slumping into inconvenient places. Why, I recall one time, down by the Mississippi, Harris tried to argue the merits of flat-earth theory to a steamboat captain. You can imagine how that went. The man nearly choked on his chewing tobacco from sheer disbelief, sputtering out a lecture on navigation and the curvature of the globe that would've given Euclid a migraine. Harris, bless his simple soul, just blinked, nodded slowly, and then asked if the captain had ever seen the edge of the world. The captain, wisely, just gave up and went back to steering.

His enthusiasm, you see, is inversely proportional to his comprehension. He gets all fired up about things he doesn't understand, like those new-fangled bicycles with the ludicrously large front wheel. Claimed he was going to ride one to California. I just patted him on the back and offered him a sturdy pair of walking boots, figuring he’d be lucky to make it out of town before landing in a ditch. And his clothes! Harris dresses like a scarecrow on holiday. Patches upon patches, mismatched buttons, and a hat that looks like it’s been through the Great Chicago Fire and back. It's a wonder dogs don't try to bury him in the garden. Yet, despite all his shortcomings, and goodness knows they are legion, Harris has a heart as big as a washtub and a loyalty that would put a bloodhound to shame. He’s the kind of friend that, when you're down on your luck and facing the gallows, will show up with a rope ladder... and probably the wrong end to throw over the wall. But he'd show up, and that, I suppose, counts for something in this topsy-turvy world.
