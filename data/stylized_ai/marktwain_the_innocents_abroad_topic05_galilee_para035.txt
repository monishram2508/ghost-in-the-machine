Galilee, bless its heart, is a land that’s far more fetching on the map than it is under your boots. Folks rave about its beauty, waxing poetic about the Sea and its gentle, rolling hills, but I reckon they’ve spent too much time sipping lemonade in the shade and not enough time actually traipsing through it. The Sea, for instance, isn’t exactly an ocean liner’s playground. More of a modestly-sized puddle, really, prone to sudden fits of temper and spitting out the occasional bewildered fish. And the hills? Well, they're undeniably hilly, I'll grant you that, but mostly they’re upholstered in scrub that’s prickly enough to give a camel second thoughts.

Now, I’m not saying it’s altogether unpleasant. The air’s agreeable enough, and there’s a certain, how shall I put it, *historic* feel to the place, seeing as how a rather important Personage did a fair bit of wandering around thereabouts. You half expect to stumble upon Him delivering a sermon or performing some miracle involving loaves and fishes - though I suspect He’d be hard-pressed to find enough loaves in modern Galilee to feed a stray cat, let alone a multitude.

The towns are… quaint. Yes, quaint. That's a charitable way of putting it. Nazareth, for instance, isn’t exactly bustling with the kind of activity that would give New York City a run for its money. One gets the distinct impression that the townspeople are perpetually engaged in a game of slow-motion chess, with the stakes being who gets to the best shade tree for the afternoon nap. Tiberias, on the Sea’s edge, tries valiantly to look like a thriving resort, but mostly succeeds in looking like a slightly faded postcard from a better, more prosperous era. It’s got a certain charm, mind you, the sort of charm that comes from knowing it’s tried its best and failed with a certain dignified grace. All in all, Galilee is a land best appreciated with a dash of imagination, a generous helping of historical context, and a sturdy pair of walking shoes. Just don’t expect to be swept off your feet by its splendor, unless you happen to trip over a particularly stubborn rock.
