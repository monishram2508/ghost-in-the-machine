Now, these Mormons, bless their cotton socks, are a spectacle to behold, I reckon. You roll into Salt Lake City, expectin' tumbleweeds and desolation, and instead, you find a place lookin' cleaner than a preacher's Sunday suit and organized to a degree that would make a Prussian general weep with envy. Brigham Young, that old fox, certainly knew how to lay out a town, I'll give him that. Though, truth be told, the whole business of multiple wives did raise a few eyebrows back East. I recall hearin' a fella in St. Louis say, "Why, it's just plain greedy, hoggin' all the womenfolk!" But then again, that fella hadn't spent much time lookin' at the pickin's out on the prairie, if you catch my drift.

They’re a peculiar bunch, these Latter-day Saints. Talk a mile a minute about golden plates and angels, things that’d sound right at home in one of them dime novels back East. And that temple of theirs! A regular fortress of righteousness, standin’ tall and proud like it's challengin' the Almighty to a game of chess. But you got to admire their industriousness. Turn any piece of desert into a blooming orchard, those Mormons could. And they stick together like burrs on a wool blanket, helpin' each other out through thick and thin. That's something to be said for a community, even if their theology is a bit… well, unique. I ain't gonna pretend to understand the finer points of their beliefs – makes my head spin something awful, it does. But I reckon if a man can be honest, work hard, and treat his neighbor right, then what does it matter if he believes in angels or invisible golden spectacles? Besides, you try and argue with one of 'em, you'll find yourself in a theological dust-up that'd last longer than a Missouri winter, and just as likely to leave you feelin' colder than a well digger's posterior.
