Gibraltar, bless its heart, is a curious wart upon the nether regions of Spain, a rocky excrescence jutting defiantly into the Mediterranean like a stubborn chin daring Neptune himself to a contest of wills. I’ve seen it described as strategically vital, a key to the Strait, but for my part, I suspect a good cannon could lob a biscuit clean over the whole of it. Still, there it sits, a bastion of Britishness so staunch it practically sweats tea and crumpets. One expects to see Queen Victoria herself descending from the misty peak, brandishing a riding crop and demanding a stiff gin and tonic. The place positively bristles with soldiers in their starched uniforms, looking for all the world like toy soldiers escaped from a particularly meticulous nursery. And the apes, those Barbary macaques! Ah, a comical crew they are, indeed. They scamper and pilfer with the brazen audacity of politicians, eyeing tourists with a calculating glint that suggests they understand perfectly well the value of a shiny trinket or a carelessly unguarded sandwich. Legend has it, you see, that as long as the apes remain, so too will the British. A convenient superstition, wouldn't you say, that allows a nation to maintain its hold on a valuable piece of real estate under the guise of protecting a gang of furry bandits? The shops, filled to bursting with duty-free wares, offer temptations enough to bankrupt a saint, though one suspects the selection of fine porcelain figurines far outweighs the demand. The Rock itself, of course, is the main attraction, a looming presence that dwarfs everything beneath it. One can ascend it by a cable car, a contraption that, while undeniably efficient, evokes the distinct feeling of being suspended in a tin can at the mercy of a particularly vindictive wind. And at the summit? A breathtaking view, to be sure, but also a disconcerting realization that one is essentially standing on top of a very large pile of rock, contemplating the vast indifference of the sea. Gibraltar, then, is a bit of a conundrum, a place where the past and the present collide in a rather charming, if slightly absurd, fashion. A place I wouldn't necessarily recommend for a long holiday, mind you, but certainly worth a peek, if only to witness the spectacle of a tiny rock, ruled by a faraway queen, defended by a regiment of toy soldiers and overseen by a parliament of mischievous apes.
