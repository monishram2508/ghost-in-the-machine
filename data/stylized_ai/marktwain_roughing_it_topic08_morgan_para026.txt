Now, Morgan, there was a specimen. A fellow built like a sawed-off oak stump and twice as stubborn. Called himself a prospector, which mostly meant he was a professional claim-jumper with a pickaxe and a talent for disappearing before the sheriff came calling. He arrived in Bodie lookin' like he'd wrestled a bear and lost – which, considerin' the bears around these parts, was not entirely outside the realm of possibility. Had a beard that could house a family of field mice, and eyes that could bore a hole through a granite mountain. Claimed he'd found the "mother lode" just over the ridge, kept it a secret close as a miser keeps his gold teeth. Of course, that mother lode shifted locations every Tuesday, dependin' on which direction the wind was blowin' and how much rotgut whiskey he'd consumed.

He was a font of tall tales, that one. Said he once used a rattlesnake as a lasso, captured a runaway stagecoach team single-handedly. Claimed he could smell gold from ten paces, a talent that seemed to conveniently vanish whenever he was within ten paces of someone else's diggings. He was as unreliable as a politician's promise, yet there was something endearing about the rascal. Perhaps it was the way he'd tip his hat to a lady even when he was dead broke, or the way he'd share his meager beans with a mangy stray dog. Or maybe, just maybe, it was the fact that in a town full of fortune-seekers, Morgan was the only one honest enough to admit he was mostly seeking fortune at someone else's expense. Eventually, Morgan vanished, as these sorts of characters tend to do. Some say he struck it rich and sailed to the Sandwich Islands. Others claimed he fell down a mineshaft and was never seen again. Me? I reckon he's probably just a few towns over, regaling a new batch of gullible tenderfoots with his preposterous stories, searchin' for that eternally elusive "mother lode," and livin' a life as colorful as a drunkard's dream.
