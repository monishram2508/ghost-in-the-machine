Harris, now, there's a specimen for you. A fella so perpetually optimistic, you'd reckon he'd just swallowed a sunshine factory, bolts and all. He approaches life with the wide-eyed innocence of a babe who's just discovered its own toes, and about as much awareness of the lurking perils. Why, I once saw him strolling down Main Street during a cloudburst, singing "Oh, Susanna," convinced the heavens were simply shedding tears of joy at his presence. The man truly believed he could charm the warts off a toad with a kind word and a pocketful of spare change. It's a quality, mind you, that's both endearing and alarming, like a newborn kitten armed with a blunderbuss.

He's got a habit of embellishing, too, our Harris. Not in a malicious way, understand, but in the manner of a painter who's just a tad too enthusiastic with the palette. A simple fishing trip, for instance, blossoms into a yarn involving a monstrous pike, a near-death experience wrestling with the beast in a leaky rowboat, and a rescue by a passing flock of trained seagulls. I swear, the man could turn buying a loaf of bread into an epic adventure involving pirates and a talking parrot. And he tells these tales with such conviction, such earnest sincerity, that you find yourself half-believing him, even as your common sense screams bloody murder. It's a testament to the sheer force of his personality, or perhaps, just evidence that I've spent too long in his company. Still, you can't help but find him amusing, in the same way one finds a runaway goat amusing: a source of constant chaos and unexpected entertainment. Yes sir, Harris is Harris, and I wouldn’t trade him for a barrel full of gold, though I might hide the valuables when he comes to visit. You never know what grand schemes are brewing behind that perpetually cheerful facade.
