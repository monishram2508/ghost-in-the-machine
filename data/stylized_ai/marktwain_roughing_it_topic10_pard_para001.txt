Pard. Now, there’s a word that’ll wrinkle the forehead of an Eastern tenderfoot quicker than a sunburnt nose. He’d likely conjure up images of speckled birds in some ornithological treatise, or maybe even think it a brand of foreign soap. But out here in the territories, pard ain’t got nothin’ to do with feathers or lather. It’s short for “partner,” which is about as reliable a definition as “morning” is for whether you'll actually get out of bed. You call a feller “pard” because you’re ridin’ alongside him, maybe sharin’ a campfire, maybe even holdin’ onto the same gold pan. It don't necessarily mean you trust him as far as you can throw a grizzly bear, mind you. I've seen pards backstab each other for a pinch of dust quicker than a rattlesnake can strike. 

Take Old Man Hemlock and Cactus Pete, for instance. They were thicker than thieves, always bickerin’ about the best way to pan for gold, but always stickin’ together through thick and thin. They were pards if there ever was such a thing. Then Hemlock found a nugget the size of a hen’s egg. Suddenly, Cactus Pete started lookin’ at Hemlock with eyes that could melt a glacier, and started sleepin' with a shotgun across his lap. Friendship, it seems, often has a price, and that price is directly proportional to the size of the gold nugget involved. So, a pard ain't always a feller to be relied upon. He's a temporary alliance, a shared circumstance, a convenient companion on a dusty road that more often than not leads to disappointment, betrayal, and the occasional gunfight. But, hell, that's the way of the West, ain't it? You just keep your eyes open, your hand near your holster, and hope your pard ain’t got his sights set on your back. And if he does, well, that’s just another story for the campfire, ain't it? Another reason to mistrust folks with shiny things in their eyes.
