Now, Slade, that was a fellow built for a purpose, and that purpose, as near as I could cipher it, was to keep the territory west of the Mississippi entertainingly chaotic. He weren't a big man, understand, not in the shoulders or the belly, but he carried himself like a locomotive with a leaky whistle, all steam and ready to blow. Why, I recollect one time in Virginia City – not the real Virginia City, mind you, but one of those other Virginia Cities that seemed to spring up faster than jackrabbits after a rainstorm – that Slade took offense to a feller lookin’ at him sideways. Not starin’, just a casual glance, the sort a man throws at a mangy coyote trottin’ by. But Slade, he wouldn’t have it. He calls the feller out, right there in front of the saloon, all sawdust and spilled whiskey, and commences to give him a lecture on proper frontier etiquette, lecturing louder and longer than any schoolmarm I ever met. The feller, a timid-lookin’ chap with spectacles perched on his nose, tries to apologize, but Slade wouldn’t hear of it. Apologies, he declared, were for weaklings and politicians.

He then, with a dramatic flourish that would've made a tragedian blush, pulls out his revolver – a fancy thing with pearl handles, I recall – and shoots the feller's hat right off his head. Now, any other man might’ve stopped there, considered justice served, but not Slade. He proceeds to dance a jig on the hat, all the while explainin’ in excruciating detail why the feller's hat deserved such treatment. The whole performance lasted a good half hour, I reckon, and by the time Slade was done, the feller was cryin’, the hat was flatter than a pancake, and the crowd was rollin’ on the ground, laughin’ fit to bust. It was a terrible thing, I suppose, but awful entertaining. Slade, he just dusted off his boots, straightened his coat, and strolled back into the saloon, like he’d just delivered a particularly eloquent sermon. Some men, they make history. Slade, he made a spectacle, and I reckon that was the more honest work of the two.
