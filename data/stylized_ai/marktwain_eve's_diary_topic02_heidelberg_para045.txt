Heidelberg. Ah, Heidelberg! A town so quaint, so dripping with romantic decay, one half expects a troupe of strolling minstrels to materialize at any moment, twanging lutes and belting out ballads of lost loves and potent beer. The castle, perched rather precariously on a hillside like a tipsy gentleman clutching a lamppost, is a magnificent ruin. Magnificent, mind you, not in the pristine, gleaming way favored by the newly rich, but in the splendid, crumbling fashion that suggests a long and colorful life, a life lived rather too well, perhaps, and certainly involving more than its fair share of cannonballs. One can almost hear the echoes of laughter, the clash of swords, the sighs of lovelorn princesses flung from its shattered windows, or at least, that's what the guidebooks would have you believe.

The Neckar River, a placid and seemingly harmless serpent winding its way through the town, reflects the scene with a knowing glint. One imagines it has witnessed countless proposals, whispered secrets, and the occasional drowned tourist lured too close by the picturesque views. The streets are cobbled, naturally, because anything less would simply not do. And the students! My, the students! They roam about with an air of profound seriousness, sporting dueling scars like badges of honor, and engaging in conversations that are undoubtedly deep and philosophical, although often conducted at volumes more suited to a battlefield than a peaceful afternoon stroll. They drink beer, of course, enormous quantities of it, and sing songs that sound suspiciously like yodeling, although they assuredly possess a deeper, more culturally significant meaning than my untutored ears can discern. The whole place, I tell you, is a confection of charm and calculated theatricality, a stage set for the human comedy, with a generous helping of sentiment and a dash of perfectly brewed German beer thrown in for good measure. One leaves Heidelberg feeling either utterly enchanted or slightly seasick from the sheer volume of picturesque beauty, or perhaps, a bit of both.
