Lucerne, now that's a place alright, perched right on the edge of that glassy lake like a cat about to bat a goldfish. They call it a city, which is fair enough, I suppose, seeing as how there’s enough cobblestone and churches to trip over to satisfy the most devout pedestrian. And speaking of churches, good heavens, they’re thicker than fleas on a hound dog in July. Each one striving to out-gild and out-bell the next, until a body’s ear drums are near to bursting. One might think they were trying to bribe their way into heaven with architectural ostentation. 

But bless their hearts, they do a tidy job of keeping the place spick and span, far tidier than I ever managed with the Garden, I must confess. Though, truth be told, my Garden was a good deal more natural; Lucerne seems determined to trim every stray blade of grass and arrange the flower boxes with an unnerving precision. It makes one wonder if they’re afraid a stray petal might lead to the downfall of the whole confounded system. And the Swiss? Oh, they’re a quiet lot, them Swiss. Dignified and punctual, like cuckoo clocks come to life. They’ll nod politely as you stumble through their language, looking at you with an expression that suggests they’re either secretly judging your pronunciation or contemplating the precise angle at which their cheese is sliced. You never can quite tell, can you? But they make a right proper chocolate, those Swiss; dark, rich, and guaranteed to make you feel a bit less guilty about all that gawking at the Alps. The Alps, now there’s a view worth seeing, I’ll grant them that. Though, mind you, after a few days of staring at those snow-capped peaks, they start to look suspiciously like giant meringue pies. All that's needed is a sprinkle of powdered sugar, and a ravenous Adam, of course.
