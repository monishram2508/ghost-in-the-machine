Baden, ah, Baden! That little nest of glittering folk nestled in the Schwarzwald, positively dripping with more dukes and duchesses than you can shake a stick at, and more spa water than the Rhine could carry in a millennium. I went, of course, for scientific observation – entirely. One simply *must* chronicle the habits of the leisured classes, mustn’t one? It was reported that the waters there possessed miraculous qualities, capable of curing gout, spleen, and even, God forbid, a faulty sense of humor. I, naturally being in impeccable health, found myself curiously unaffected by the purported miracles. However, the sheer spectacle of gouty grandees hobbling about in bathrobes, clutching porcelain cups filled with sulfurous smelling liquid, was a cure in itself, at least for my boredom. The gambling tables, though! Therein lies a tale, or rather, several tales spun from the threads of fortune and folly. One could observe a bejeweled countess, looking as serene as a marble Venus, losing her entire season's allowance on a single turn of the wheel, while a moustachioed merchant, smelling suspiciously of cheese and prosperity, raked in the spoils with a grin as wide as the Black Forest itself. The air buzzed with the anxieties of hope and the quiet desperation of ruin, all seasoned with the faint scent of eau de cologne and freshly laundered banknotes. And the clothes! My dear Eve, you simply wouldn't believe the confections these women parade about in. Enough lace and velvet to clothe a small nation, and so many feathers they could have launched themselves into the air and migrated south for the winter. All in all, Baden is a most curious place, a sort of gilded cage filled with the songs of self-deception and the clinking of gold. I left, as I arrived, entirely unburdened by either gout, spleen, or fortune, but considerably richer in the observation of human nature’s enduring capacity for both ridiculousness and charm. I wouldn't recommend drinking the water, though. It does smell rather like rotten eggs, if I'm being perfectly honest.
