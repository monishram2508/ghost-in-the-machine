Naples, ah, Naples! A city that assaults the senses like a rogue Vesuvian ash cloud, leaving one sputtering and blinking, though perhaps not in quite the way Pompeii intended. I dare say I’ve seen cleaner stables, and quieter ones, too, though a Neapolitan stable, I imagine, would be a positively operatic affair, complete with impromptu arias from the donkey. The streets, bless their cobbled souls, are a veritable labyrinth of humanity, where Vespas buzz like angry hornets and laundry hangs strung between buildings like victorious banners after a particularly chaotic battle. One might think, observing the sheer density of life crammed into those narrow thoroughfares, that the world was ending imminently and everyone was desperately trying to be last in line for the pearly gates. And speaking of ending, the garbage! Good heavens, the garbage! It piles up with a fervor that suggests a conscious will to conquer the very city itself, reaching heights that rival the lesser monuments. A fellow could get lost in it, never to be seen again, except perhaps as a fossilized discovery for some future archaeologist, forever entwined with a discarded pizza box and a well-worn copy of "La Gazzetta dello Sport." The Neapolitans, however, seem utterly unfazed by this general state of amiable squalor. They navigate the chaos with a grace that borders on the miraculous, bartering for fish that have seen better days, gesturing wildly with hands that could conduct an entire orchestra, and somehow managing to maintain an air of profound contentment. One gets the distinct impression that they've made a pact with the dirt, a sort of unspoken agreement to coexist in a mutually beneficial state of organized disorder. It’s a place that makes one question the very nature of civilization, then promptly order another plate of spaghetti alle vongole because, well, even in the midst of glorious chaos, one must eat. And in Naples, the food, at least, is divine justification for absolutely everything.
