Ballou, ah, Ballou! Now there's a specimen ripe for study, a curiosity fit for a museum, though I reckon the curator would need a stronger constitution than mine to handle him for long. He arrived in these parts, green as a Sierra Nevada pine needle in July, claiming to be a lawyer – a title he wore like a borrowed suit three sizes too big. Said he'd been practicing back East, though nobody could recall ever seeing his name on a shingle, or hearing tell of him ever winning a case, unless you count the time he convinced Mrs. O’Malley to pay him five dollars to get her cat down from a tree, and then promptly fell out himself, breaking his arm and requiring Dr. Ferguson's ministrations for a week. Even the cat wouldn't thank him for that.

He had this perpetual air of earnestness, this wide-eyed innocence that would have been charming if it wasn't so consistently misplaced. He’d trust a gambler with his gold watch and a snake-oil salesman with his last dollar, all with a beaming smile and a firm handshake. He was perpetually getting cheated, hoodwinked, and generally taken for a ride, but it never seemed to dim his enthusiasm. In fact, I suspect he secretly enjoyed being the butt of the joke, believing it somehow added to his rugged Western character. He took to wearing a ten-gallon hat that nearly swallowed him whole, and affected a drawl thicker than molasses, even though I’d swear he was born and bred in some bustling city back East. 

And his attempts at mining! Lord have mercy, it was a comedy from start to finish. He'd pick the spot with the least likely prospect, dig with the tenacity of a badger, and then strike nothing but solid granite. But did that deter him? Not a bit! He'd just dust himself off, declare that "the real treasure is the camaraderie, not the gold," and proceed to bore the rest of us with his newfound philosophy. Bless his heart, he was a walking, talking advertisement for the triumph of optimism over experience, a testament to the fact that even the most well-meaning fool can bring a smile to your face, even as he's driving you mad. He's a strange sort, our Ballou, but a man can't help but feel a touch of fondness for the hapless cuss, even as he's planning his next misadventure.
