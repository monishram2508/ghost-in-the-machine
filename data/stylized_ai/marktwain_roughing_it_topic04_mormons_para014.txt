Well, I reckon I’ve seen some peculiar specimens in my ramblings, but the Mormons out in Utah Territory, they’re a breed apart, I tell you. Brigham Young, now there’s a character worthy of a dime novel. He’s got more wives than hairs on a buffalo’s back, and rules that Salt Lake City like he owns the place, which, come to think of it, he pretty much does. A fella goes to town expecting tumbleweeds and dust devils, instead, there's a city rising out of the desert like a mirage, all thanks to these industrious, if somewhat mystifying, Mormons. They’re always irrigating something, be it crops or converting souls. Seem to have a knack for both.

They're always polite, mind you, the Mormons, even when they're trying to convince you that golden plates were dug up and translated into a holy book. Which, if you ask me, is a yarn thicker than a mountain man’s beard. But they believe it, by thunder, they truly believe it, and that conviction is a thing to behold, comical though it may seem to a hard-boiled skeptic like myself. I once saw a feller arguing the finer points of polygamy with a saloon regular who’d had a bit too much redeye. The Mormon was as calm as a Sunday sermon, while the drunk was howling like a coyote at the moon. Quite a spectacle. You see them everywhere, these Mormons, pushing handcarts across the plains, bright-eyed missionaries knocking on doors, and always, always, building something. You almost start to believe there must be something to the claims if they work as hard as they do. And then you remember the polygamy and the golden plates, and you chuckle to yourself. The Territory is full of wonder.
