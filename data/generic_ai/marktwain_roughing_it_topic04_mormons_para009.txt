The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian denomination that originated in the United States in the 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith, the faith centers on the belief that God restored the original church of Jesus Christ through him, providing additional scripture and divine authority. The most prominent of these additional scriptures is the Book of Mormon, which members consider to be a companion scripture to the Bible and a testament of Jesus Christ, detailing God’s dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Central to Mormon theology is the concept of continuous revelation, suggesting that God continues to communicate with humanity through living prophets and apostles. This distinguishes them from many other Christian denominations who believe revelation ceased with the Bible.

Mormon beliefs also encompass distinctive doctrines about the nature of God, humanity, and the afterlife. They believe in a Godhead composed of three distinct beings – God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost – who are united in purpose but separate in being. Humans are viewed as spirit children of God, capable of progressing towards godhood themselves through obedience to divine laws and ordinances. Temples are considered sacred places where special ordinances, such as eternal marriage and baptism for the dead, are performed, believed to bind families together for eternity and offer salvation to those who died without the opportunity to accept the gospel. Missionary work is a significant aspect of the faith, with young members often serving full-time missions, spreading their beliefs across the globe. The Church emphasizes a strict moral code, including abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, as well as adherence to principles of honesty, integrity, and service to others. While the Church has faced historical controversies, it has grown into a global organization with millions of members worldwide, actively involved in humanitarian efforts and community building initiatives. They are increasingly focused on transparency and outreach, striving to foster understanding and dispel misconceptions about their faith.
