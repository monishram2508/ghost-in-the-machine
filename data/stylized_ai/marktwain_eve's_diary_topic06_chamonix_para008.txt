Chamonix, they call it; a name that rolls off the tongue like a particularly stubborn morsel of Mont Blanc pastry, all sugary promise and mountainous substance. A veritable anthill swarming with eager ants, these tourists, all clambering for a crumb of the majestic peak that lords over this valley like a king upon his throne, though a king perpetually cloaked in a snowy stole, I fancy. The air, oh, the air! Pure as a preacher’s Sunday sermon, or so they’d have you believe, though I suspect a few perfumed ladies from Paris have already managed to contaminate it with their floral fancies and the faintest hint of societal artifice.

One witnesses the most peculiar sights here, I assure you. Burly men, their faces the colour of well-weathered leather, attempting to control contraptions that promise to whisk them upwards to a vantage point, yet seem to possess a will of their own, jerking and shuddering like a recalcitrant donkey. And then there are the climbers, bless their ambitious souls, roped together like sausages destined for some celestial barbeque, inching their way up sheer cliffs as if defying gravity were but a minor inconvenience. One cannot help but wonder if they pack a good picnic lunch for these ascensions, for surely, one builds up an appetite challenging the laws of nature. The town itself, nestled between these imposing giants, offers a curious mix of Alpine charm and blatant commercialism. Shops selling little chalets made of chocolate stand cheek-by-jowl with establishments hawking mountaineering equipment capable of withstanding a nuclear winter. A person can acquire a yodelling cuckoo clock and an ice axe within a stone’s throw of each other, which strikes me as a rather delightful, if somewhat bewildering, juxtaposition. Indeed, Chamonix is a place where the sublime and the ridiculous dance a waltz of unparalleled absurdity, and one is left to ponder whether the breathtaking scenery is not, perhaps, a cleverly disguised distraction from the truly comical spectacle unfolding at its feet.
