Harris, bless his simple heart, is a specimen worthy of study, much like the common garden slug, though perhaps less slimy to the touch, depending on the day and the nature of the latest business venture he's convinced himself is just around the corner from striking gold. He possesses an enthusiasm that would be admirable were it not so often misplaced, like a compass that permanently points due south regardless of where one happens to be standing. I recall one sweltering summer afternoon, Harris, convinced he'd located a vein of pure silver in Farmer McGregor's back forty, dragged the poor man, myself, and a mule named Beatrice (who looked none too pleased with the arrangement) across hill and dale with a divining rod fashioned from a willow branch and an old umbrella handle. We dug holes that could have swallowed Beatrice whole, sweated like prize hogs in August, and discovered absolutely nothing save for a nest of particularly aggressive yellow jackets who seemed to take umbrage at our intrusion. Harris, unfazed, declared the silver must be "playing coy" and promptly launched into a detailed explanation of how he'd outsmart it, involving mirrors, a complex system of pulleys, and Beatrice's uncanny ability to sense precious metals (a quality, I might add, she never displayed that day or any other). He’s a fount of boundless optimism, our Harris, a veritable geyser of unshakeable, if frequently misguided, faith in his own capabilities. He reminds me of a man trying to sell ice to Eskimos, only he truly believes the Eskimos desperately need the ice, and that he’s uniquely qualified to provide it. He's the kind of fellow who'd enter a pie-eating contest against a bear and come away convinced he'd won, even with fur in his teeth and a claw mark on his cheek. One can't help but be fond of him, despite his utter lack of practicality. He's a walking, talking testament to the enduring power of hope, even if it’s hope perpetually aimed in the wrong direction.
