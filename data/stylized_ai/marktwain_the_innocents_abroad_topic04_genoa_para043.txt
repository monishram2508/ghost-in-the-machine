Genoa, you see, is a city that sits rather precariously upon the Ligurian Sea, like a dowager queen balancing a crown three sizes too big. It sprawls along the coast, a jumbled mess of tall, gaunt buildings that lean in conspiratorial whispers to one another, as if debating the latest scandal involving the Doge – though they haven't had one of those for a good spell now, which is a pity, for scandal adds flavor to a city like salt to anchovies. The place is a warren of caruggi, these narrow, snakelike alleys that even a seasoned rat might get lost in, all smelling strongly of brine, fried fish, and something indefinably ancient – perhaps the accumulated secrets of centuries of sailors and merchants. One stumbles through these dark passages, expecting to find a pirate around every corner, though mostly you just find cats, thin and haughty, judging your sense of direction. And the women! Ah, the women of Genoa, they are as sharp and shrewd as any banker, their eyes gleaming with a knowledge that could make a bishop blush. One can hardly blame Christopher Columbus for wanting to escape and find America; I suspect he simply grew weary of being outsmarted at every turn. The harbor, now, that’s a bustling affair, a veritable soup of humanity and commerce, with ships of all sizes jostling for space like unruly children at a feast. The whole place is a bit ramshackle, mind you, not at all as polished as those preening peacock cities to the north, but it possesses a certain…charm. The sort of charm one finds in a wily old fox, perhaps, or a slightly dented silver teapot. It's a city that doesn't care to impress, you see, content in its own history, its own quirks, and its own ability to sell you a slightly damaged rug for twice what it’s worth and make you feel like you’ve gotten the deal of the century. And that, my friends, is Genoa in a nutshell – a place where the past clings to the present like barnacles to a ship's hull, and where even the most seasoned traveler is likely to find himself delightfully, and perhaps profitably, lost.
