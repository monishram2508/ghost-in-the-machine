The chamois, bless their mountain-goat souls, are a marvel, ain’t they? I've seen 'em scamperin' about in the Alps, looking as if they'd misplaced their common sense somewhere between peaks. A creature that insists on living where a decent human wouldn't even consider a picnic! They’re all skinny legs and a sort of earnest expression, as if they’re eternally apologizing for being so darned nimble. One minute they’re a smudge of brown against a granite face, the next they’ve vanished like a politician's promise after election day.

They have these little horns, curled backward, like someone tried to give them a permanent wave with a hot poker and got distracted halfway through. Honestly, you'd think a fella living on sheer cliff faces would evolve something a tad more substantial for defense. But no, just these dainty curlicues, suitable more for snagging on low-hanging clouds than for a serious brawl with, say, a particularly disgruntled eagle.

And the leaping! Good gracious, the leaping! They bound about like they’ve got springs where their brains ought to be. It's all perfectly calculated, I suppose, physics and whatnot, but to the untutored eye, it looks like pure, unadulterated foolhardiness. Makes you wonder if they secretly enjoy the thrill of teetering on the precipice, just to show off to the glaciers. I wager they get into all sorts of scrapes, though. Likely tumble down now and then, landing in snowdrifts with a surprised bleat and a head full of alpine wildflowers. I reckon the local undertaker probably owes the chamois a debt of gratitude, or maybe just has a special discount for those who make a habit of testing gravity. A truly remarkable creature, the chamois, if you can appreciate a certain brand of reckless elegance that could only come about from being born a goat in the land where mountains are the status quo.
