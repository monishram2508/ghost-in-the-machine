Zermatt, you say? Why, it's a place of such absurd contradiction it would make a bishop question his faith, I reckon. Perched high amongst the Alps like a cuckoo clock town on a particularly precarious shelf, Zermatt is a haven for those who fancy themselves mountaineers, though half of 'em look more like they're dressed for a Sunday picnic in the Catskills than a tussle with a mountain. The Matterhorn, that spiky devil, lords over the whole affair, practically daring you to try and climb it. I confess, I've entertained the notion myself, mainly to see if I could knock some sense into its arrogant peak. But then I recall I've never been overly fond of heights, or excessive exertion, or icy crevasses which I suspect might harbor disgruntled yetis.

The charm of Zermatt, as they call it, is that it's car-free. Which means the place is overrun with electric carts, those infernal contraptions that zip about with the quiet malevolence of a cat stalking a canary. It's silent danger, I tell you, a whisper away from becoming a pedestrian pancake. The shops are filled with the sort of frippery you'd expect - watches costing more than a decent farm in Missouri, chocolate that tastes like the tears of joy wept by a thousand Swiss cows, and enough woolen sweaters to clothe an entire arctic expedition. And the tourists! Oh, the tourists! A veritable kaleidoscope of nationalities, all squinting at the Matterhorn as if it were some sort of exotic dessert. They clutch their maps, consult their guidebooks with the fervor of religious zealots, and generally manage to get in the way of anyone actually trying to *do* something, be it hiking, or skiing, or simply enjoying a sausage. One suspects half of 'em wouldn't know a glacier from a gooseberry bush. Still, they seem happy enough, basking in the rarefied air and the reflected glory of a mountain they'll likely never climb. It's a grand show, indeed, a human comedy played out against the backdrop of nature's most imposing stage.
