Well, I reckon I saw a glacier once, up yonder in them Alps, a hulking, blue-ish monstrosity it were, like a petrified ocean caught in a particularly foul mood. It sat there, you see, all glum and frozen, and I couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for it. Imagine, spending centuries just oozing along, inch by stubborn inch, powered by nothing but the weight of its own frozen self-importance! Why, a snail could offer it speed dating tips. They say it’s a river of ice, but I maintain that a river needs to actually, you know, *flow*. This glacier was more like a constipated river, eternally struggling to relieve itself of a few pebbles.

And the noise! Lord, the racket! Not the grand, majestic rumble some folks romanticize about, but more like the world’s largest ice cube tray cracking under the strain of a particularly hot summer. Little bits kept breaking off, with a sound like a grumpy giant clearing his throat. The guide, a skinny fellow with spectacles perpetually askew, explained it all with a straight face, something about erosion and moraines and other such learned poppycock. I suspect he learned the names of these things just to sound impressive, like calling your mud puddle a "lacustrine deposit." What I found most impressive was the glacier's sheer obstinacy. It's like a stubborn mule, refusing to budge even when the sun is trying to melt the very ground beneath it. 

It did spark one thought, though: if a glacier can move with such agonizing slowness, and yet grind mountains to pebbles, then what might we mortals accomplish if we just stopped whining and got on with it, bit by miserable bit? Probably nothing. I daresay the glacier gets all the glory, and rightly so. At least it's good for making fancy ice cubes for rich folks' cocktails.
