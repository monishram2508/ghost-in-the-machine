Well, I reckon I’ve seen sights in my time, and some of ‘em were just plumb peculiar, but this here glacier takes the cake, the whole kit and caboodle, so to speak. Picture, if you will, a river – but not your common, everyday, gurgling, frolicking river. No sir, this one's made of stone-cold, hard-hearted ice. And it ain’t just lying there, innocent as a babe in arms. It’s creeping, inching its way down the mountain, like a landlord coming to collect rent, slow but relentless. It's like Mother Nature done made herself a giant, frozen snail, all gritty and grey, chewing on the scenery as she goes. They say it moves a foot a day, maybe two on a good day, which is about as exciting as watching paint dry, I suppose, unless you’re of a mind to measure such things, which I confess I ain't.

And the noise! Not a soothing babble like the creeks back home, but a constant groan, like an old fella trying to get out of bed after a long winter nap. Cracks and pops echo about, and bits break off, which they call "calving," fancy name for a glorified ice cube falling into the water. It's a right comical sight, really. The mountain goats don’t pay it no mind, those wise critters just keep on munching on the high grass, as if to say, "Well, I've seen it all before, let me tell you."

The scientists – bless their cotton socks – they're all in a flap about it, studying its every move, measuring its thickness with instruments that cost more than my whole farm is worth, yammering on about climate change and melting rates. I reckon they think they’re the first to notice the thing’s diminishing. Why, even a blind possum could see this icy behemoth is losing weight faster than a politician shedding promises. But that's their business, I suppose. Me, I'm just a humble observer, marveling at this grand, frozen spectacle, wondering what tall tales the old-timers will tell about it a hundred years from now, when it’s likely shrunk to a mere trickle, or maybe just a damp patch on the mountainside.
