Heidelberg, bless its romantic little heart, is just the sort of place a body could lose themselves in, and quite a few have, judging from the lovesick sonnets scratched into the Old Bridge. It’s a town seemingly designed by a lovesick apothecary, blending history, sentiment, and just a touch of melancholy, like a fine concoction meant to either cure or exacerbate a broken heart. The castle, a magnificent ruin perched atop the hill, looms over the town like a disapproving aunt watching the youngsters’ romantic escapades below. It’s grand, mind you, but also a bit dilapidated, rather like a wealthy dowager who’s seen better days but still retains a certain undeniable charm and a tendency to reminisce at length.

The student life, ah, that’s a spectacle in itself! They stroll about, these young scholars, with an air of profound importance, puffing on their pipes and debating the weighty matters of the universe, or, more likely, who won the last beer-drinking contest. The student prison, the Studentenkarzer, is a particularly delightful institution. Imagine, locking up budding philosophers for public intoxication! One can only assume that the walls are covered in doodles of profound drunken insight, along with the occasional complaint about the quality of the beer ration.

And the Neckar River? A tranquil, meandering beauty, upon which little boats glide, bearing romancing couples who are, I suspect, often more concerned with not capsizing than with the profundity of their love. You can walk along the Philosophenweg, the Philosopher’s Walk, and contemplate the great questions of existence, or simply enjoy the view and speculate on whether the fellow across the river is contemplating the same thing. Most likely, they're thinking about lunch. Heidelberg, you see, is a town that encourages both deep thought and a healthy appetite, a combination that, I daresay, is essential for a well-rounded individual, or at the very least, a contented one.
