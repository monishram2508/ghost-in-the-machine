Now, Harris, bless his peculiar soul. He was one of those specimens you encounter but once in a blue moon, a human curiosity shop if you will, filled with the most astonishing assortment of misplaced notions and stubbornly held misinformation. He’d tell you, with the absolute conviction of a parson delivering a sermon, that the pyramids were built by a secret society of trained squirrels using only acorns for mortar. Try to argue with him, and you’d be met with a look of pity so profound it could curdle milk. He truly believed it. The more absurd the proposition, the tighter Harris clung to it. I reckon his mind was a sort of echo chamber for preposterous ideas, each one bouncing around and gaining strength with every repetition.

He had a way of observing the world that was, to put it gently, skewed. A sunset, for instance, wasn't just a sunset to Harris. It was a sign, no doubt, of imminent volcanic activity in the Azores. A flock of birds flying south? Evidence, clearly, of a global conspiracy involving carrier pigeons and coded messages. You could never quite tell if he was pulling your leg, but the sheer earnestness on his face usually betrayed him. He was deadly serious, the poor fellow.

And his storytelling! Lord preserve us. He'd embark on a tale, starting somewhere near the foothills of plausible, only to be swept away by a torrent of embellishments and outlandish detours. You might begin hearing about a simple fishing trip, and before you knew it, you were neck-deep in a harrowing account of battling a sea serpent with nothing but a leaky rowboat and a rusty sardine fork. He'd throw in details so vivid, so utterly improbable, that you'd swear you were right there with him, battling the beast alongside. And the kicker? He'd swear it all happened exactly as he told it, down to the serpent's particularly offensive breath and the precise angle of the sun on the sardine fork. It was enough to make a body question the very nature of reality, all thanks to Harris and his uniquely embellished version thereof.
