Now, I reckon I spent some time amongst them Mormons in Utah Territory, and a curious bunch they are, I tell you what. Salt Lake City, pretty as a picture from afar, nestled in that valley like a stolen jewel, but get close enough and you'll find some mighty peculiar goings-on. Brigham Young, now he was a fella who knew how to keep a town in order, even if that order included a whole mess of wives and a decided preference for things done his way. You'd see ‘em all, the wives, bustling about, kids aplenty running hither and yon, a veritable army of little Saints in the making. Some folks whispered it was heaven on earth for a man, others allowed as it was hell for everyone, especially the poor fellas who hadn't quite managed to snag even one wife.

They were industrious, though, couldn't fault ‘em there. Turned that barren desert into a garden, by gum! Irrigation ditches crisscrossing every which way, crops sprouting where you wouldn't expect a tumbleweed to take root. They worked like beavers, and sang hymns while they did it, too, which I found a mite unnerving at times. Seemed like even the chickens laid eggs with a little Mormon piety sprinkled in. The whole place was a study in contradictions: pious on Sundays, shrewd businessmen during the week. They could quote scripture at the drop of a hat, but they could also haggle over the price of wool until the cows came home. Always had a smile for you, too, even if you suspected they were sizing you up to see if you were a good prospect for conversion, or at least a good customer for their molasses. And their tabernacle, that was a thing to see, alright. Built with their own hands, and acoustics so fine you could hear a pin drop clear across the room, or so they claimed. I swear, though, I heard more whispering and shuffling than pin-dropping, especially during those lengthy sermons. Still, I can’t deny, they were something else, them Mormons, a bit strange, a bit admirable, and a whole lot interesting. Worth the trip, even if just to say I’d seen it all.
