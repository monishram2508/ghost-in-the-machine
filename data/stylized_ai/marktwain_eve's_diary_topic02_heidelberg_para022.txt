Heidelberg, you see, is a town positively drunk on antiquity, and quite puffed up about its castle, as any crumbling old ruin with a view is wont to be. One half expects it to start reciting dusty poems in Latin and reminiscing about the Holy Roman Empire, a subject so convoluted it gives one a headache just to contemplate it. The students, bless their youthful indiscretions, contribute their own layer of charm, parading about in dueling scars like badges of honour. They seem to believe that having one's face artistically rearranged is a solid foundation for a successful career in law or philosophy, and who am I to disagree? The air practically vibrates with the echoes of drunken songs and earnest debates about the meaning of life – though mostly drunken songs, if I'm honest. The Neckar River, that lazy serpent winding its way through the valley, reflects it all back with a knowing glint in its watery eye, as if it has seen this very same spectacle repeated for centuries. One strolls along its banks, past gingerbread houses that look suspiciously like something out of a Grimms' fairy tale, and half expects to encounter a troll demanding passage, or perhaps Gretel feeding breadcrumbs to ducks with a decidedly sinister glint in her eye. The souvenir shops, naturally, are overflowing with cuckoo clocks, beer steins, and miniature castles, all designed to separate the gullible tourist from his hard-earned marks. It is a veritable cornucopia of clichés, yet strangely, utterly, irresistible. For Heidelberg, despite its blatant self-importance and its predictable tourist traps, possesses a certain undeniable magic. Perhaps it is the weight of history, or the exuberance of youth, or the sheer prettiness of the place, but whatever it is, it has a way of sneaking into your heart and making you forgive it its many faults. One leaves with a head full of beer, a pocket full of useless trinkets, and a lingering fondness for a town that is both wonderfully charming and utterly absurd.
