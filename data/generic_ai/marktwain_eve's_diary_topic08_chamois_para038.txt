Chamois, lithe and agile ungulates belonging to the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae, are captivating creatures of the high mountains. Found primarily in the European Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, and other mountainous regions of Europe and Asia Minor, these sure-footed mammals are perfectly adapted to navigating steep, rocky terrain. Their relatively small size, typically reaching a shoulder height of around 70-85 cm and weighing between 30-60 kg, allows them to move with remarkable speed and precision. Their coat, a rich reddish-brown in summer, transforms to a darker, denser grey-brown in winter, providing effective camouflage against the changing landscape. A distinctive feature is the black stripe running from the eye to the muzzle, which contrasts sharply with the lighter face. Both males (bucks) and females (does) possess short, hooked horns that curve backwards, providing a visual marker of their species. These horns, however, are more pronounced and slightly larger in males, often exhibiting subtle differences in curvature depending on age and individual variation.

Chamois are herbivores, their diet consisting of grasses, herbs, leaves, and shoots. They are highly selective feeders, choosing the most nutritious and palatable vegetation available in their challenging environment. Their foraging strategies are dictated by the seasonal availability of food and the fluctuating snow cover that can bury their preferred food sources for extended periods. During the warmer months, they graze on lush alpine meadows, while in winter they descend to lower altitudes or dig through the snow to access frozen vegetation. Chamois are social animals, typically living in small herds led by an older female. These herds offer protection from predators, such as wolves, lynx, and eagles, and facilitate the sharing of knowledge about optimal foraging locations. The rutting season, which occurs in late autumn, is a time of intense competition between males, who engage in dramatic displays of dominance, including chasing, posturing, and occasional horn clashes, to win the right to mate with receptive females. After a gestation period of approximately six months, the does give birth to a single kid, or occasionally twins, in the spring. The young chamois are precocial, able to follow their mothers shortly after birth, and quickly learn the essential skills for survival in their challenging mountainous habitat.
