Now, I've seen a few religious establishments in my time, from the gaudy cathedrals crammed with guilt-ridden statues to the plain-spoken Quaker meetinghouses where a cough could clear the room faster than a preacher’s sermon on sin. But a mosque, now that's a horse of a different color, as they say. Not, mind you, that it’s painted like a calico pony, but more in the spirit of being something refreshingly...foreign. Take the architecture, for instance. You won't find any pointy steeples trying to poke holes in the Almighty’s celestial carpet. Instead, you get these magnificent domes, like inverted teacups of grand proportion, promising a more comfortable conversation with the heavens, I reckon. And the minarets! Oh, those slender fellows standing guard! They remind me of those toothpick towers the dandies used to build with matchsticks – except sturdier, of course, and thankfully lacking the dandies.

Inside, it’s a study in simplicity. Carpets thicker than a politician's promise cover the floor, bless their cottony hearts, and no pews to be seen. Seems everyone takes a knee on equal footing before the Big Man Upstairs. Fair enough, I always say, equality's a fine notion, especially when your knees are begging for mercy after a long Sunday sermon. And the walls, forget your stained-glass saints and grim-faced apostles. Instead, you find calligraphic swirls so intricate they look like the Almighty Himself sneezed poetry onto the plaster. And the air, filled with a hushed reverence, occasionally punctuated by the lilting chant of the muezzin, calling folks to prayer. Makes a fella feel like he's stumbled into a different world, a world where quiet contemplation reigns supreme, and even a hardened cynic like myself might just consider, for a moment, that there might be something more to this whole faith business than meets the eye. Though, I'd still bet my bottom dollar on human nature to muck things up eventually.
