Well, I reckon I’ve seen most every kind of spectacle this world has to offer, from the eruption of Vesuvius (a frightful noisy affair, I tell you, with more smoke than actual brimstone) to a cat playing the piano (though I suspect some skulduggery there, involving a hidden lever and a particularly dim-witted feline). But I’ll be hanged if anything quite takes the biscuit like a glacier. Here's this river, see, a river of ice so thick it makes a Mississippi steamboat look like a toothpick, and it’s crawling along slower than a snail with rheumatism. You stand there, gaping like a trout, watching it inch its way down a mountain, and you can’t help but wonder what the almighty Creator was thinking when he dreamt up this slow-motion catastrophe.

It ain't exactly a graceful dance, no sir. More like a ponderous brute, shoving aside rocks and trees like they were so much confetti. Grinds them to powder, too, leaving behind a scar on the land that even time can’t seem to heal. And the noise! Not the pleasant babble of a brook, mind you, but a low, guttural groan that sounds like the earth itself is having a bad stomach ache. You can hear it in your bones, that groan, and it gives you the willies, it does.

Then there’s the meltwater, a torrent of icy blue that’s colder than a mother-in-law’s stare. Enough water there to float Noah’s Ark, and twice as muddy besides. They tell me these glaciers are shrinking, disappearing like a politician’s promise after an election. Say it’s something to do with the climate, which, if you ask me, has always been a fickle old thing anyway. But it strikes me as a tad ironic, don’t it? This vast, frozen beast, surrendering to a bit of sunshine. Makes you wonder if even the most formidable things in this world are just playing for time, waiting for the inevitable thaw.
