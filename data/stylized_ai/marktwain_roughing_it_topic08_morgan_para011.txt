Now, this Morgan, he was a specimen and a half, I tell you what. Found him up near Virginia City, back when the hills were practically coughin' up silver dollars. A lanky cuss, built like a gatepost after a tumbleweed collision. Face long enough to shadowbox with his own nose, and a chin that could shatter granite if he sneezed too hard. Wore clothes that looked like they'd lost a fight with a buzzsaw and a dust devil, which, come to think of it, they probably had. Claimed to be a prospector, though I never did see him prospectin' anything but the bottom of a whiskey bottle down at the Golden Gulch Saloon. He had this story, you see, about a lost mine, richer than Croesus and twice as conveniently forgotten. "Lost it," he'd slur, wipin' froth off his whiskers with the back of his hand, "right there behind Pike's Peak. Just need a little grubstake, see, and ol' Morgan will be swimmin' in nuggets before you can say 'Jack Robinson's Aunt!'"

Of course, half the fellers in Nevada had a story about a lost mine, each one more preposterous than the last. But Morgan, bless his addled heart, he told it with such conviction, such tear-jerking sincerity, that you almost, *almost*, believed him. Except, you know, when he’d start cryin' over his imaginary burro that got et by a pack of philosophical coyotes who debated the merits of existentialism before their midnight snack. He was a walking, talking tall tale, that one. But harmless, mostly. Unless you happened to be the bartender who refused to extend him credit. Then he’d get all riled up and start reciting poetry, which was about as effective as tryin' to put out a prairie fire with a teaspoon. Good riddance, I say, though I bet that philosophical pack of coyotes is still wondering why they tasted so strongly of stale beer.
