Now, concerning this matter of "bucksheesh," as they call it in those sun-baked lands where palms sprout like whiskers on a lazy man’s chin, it's a thing that fairly tickles a fellow's curiosity, and his pocketbook too, if he ain't careful. Why, it’s naught but a gilded cage for a bribe, a sweetened pill for extortion, all dressed up in the finery of custom and tradition. You see a fellow lugging your baggage? Bucksheesh! You need a donkey to navigate those cobbled streets that twist like a politician’s promises? Bucksheesh! You even breathe too loud near a local dignitary, and I wager, a hand will be out, expectin' its due, yellin' of bucksheesh! It’s as if the very air is taxed, and you must grease the palms of the wind itself just to keep from suffocating.

I recall, during my own wanderings 'round those parts, I tried to be clever, you see. Figured I'd get by on charm and a winning smile. Bless my innocent heart. That lasted about as long as a snowball in the Sahara. Found myself practically bankrupted by the insistence of it. Why, I swear, I paid more to avoid delays than it would have cost to simply sail around the world twice! And the funny part is, everyone knows it’s a humbug, a sham, a right proper swindle. The fella taking the coin is smirking like a fox who's just dined on a whole coop of chickens. And you're handing it over, knowing full well you're being fleeced. Yet, you do it anyway, because to not do it is to invite a lecture on tradition, a delay in your journey, or, heaven forbid, a curse from some wizened old hag who claims to commune with the spirits of the very dust beneath your feet! It's a curious game, this bucksheesh, a dance of mutual pretense where everyone knows the steps, and nobody admits to enjoying the music. One might even call it a civilized form of thievery, perfected over centuries.
