Now, this fella Morgan, he weren't much to look at, mind you. Sort of a lean, rangy type, like a half-starved coyote that'd swallowed a flagpole. Hair the color of sun-baked clay and a nose that pointed ever’where 'cept where it ought to. But appearances, as my dear departed Aunt Hildy used to say – bless her soul, may she rest in a better upholstered rocking chair than she ever owned in this life – appearances can be de-ceiv-ing. Morgan, you see, had a brain that could out-think a whole flock of Harvard professors plannin' a heist. He could smell a fool a mile off, especially if that fool was carryin' a pocket full of gold dust and a map to a lost mine.

I recollect one time, down in Bodie – a town so rough, the dogs carried pistols – Morgan came across this feller, puffed up like a poisoned toad, claimin' he'd found a vein of silver thicker'n a lady's waist. This feller, he was swindlin' folks blind, sellin' shares in his “sure thing” claim. Now, most fellers woulda challenged him to a duel, or maybe just taken to stealin' his burro in the dead of night, but not Morgan. He just sidled up, all innocent-like, and started asking questions, slow and deliberate, like he was tryin' to teach a mule arithmetic. Pretty soon, he had that puffed-up toad tangled in his own web of lies. Turns out, the vein was thinner'n a politician's promise, and the whole thing was a hoax. Morgan never raised his voice, never cracked a smile, just let the feller choke on his own humbug. He then politely purchased the whole property, for the price of a bottle of whiskey I reckon, and ended up unearthing a whole mother lode of pure gold, proving that sometimes, silence is indeed golden, especially when it's followed by pockets full of the real stuff. Point being, that Morgan, he was a character, a study, a veritable dissertation of human cunning, all wrapped up in a package that looked like it'd been dragged backwards through a cactus patch.
