The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist religious movement that began in the United States in the early 19th century. Central to their beliefs is the Book of Mormon, which they believe to be another testament of Jesus Christ, supplementing the Bible. This book, along with the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, forms their scriptural canon. Mormons believe that Joseph Smith, the founder of the church, received divine visitations and translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates. He then organized the Church in 1830, claiming it to be a restoration of the original church established by Jesus Christ. A distinctive aspect of Mormon theology is its emphasis on continuing revelation, the belief that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets. This belief distinguishes them from many other Christian denominations who generally view the canon of scripture as closed.

Mormonism places significant importance on family and community, with strong emphasis on traditional family values. Their social structure is highly organized, with local congregations, called wards, led by lay leaders. They actively participate in missionary work, with young adults often dedicating one to two years of their lives to proselyting in various parts of the world. Temple worship is another crucial aspect of their faith, where members participate in sacred ordinances, including baptisms for the dead, which they believe provide opportunities for deceased individuals to accept the gospel. Historically, the church practiced polygamy in the 19th century, which led to considerable controversy and conflict with the U.S. government. The church officially discontinued the practice in 1890.

Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a global religion with millions of members worldwide. They are known for their strong sense of community, charitable endeavors, and promotion of healthy living. While their beliefs and practices differ significantly from traditional Christianity, they consider themselves to be Christian, emphasizing their belief in Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world. Their doctrine includes a unique view of the afterlife, emphasizing eternal progression and the potential for individuals to become like God. The church has faced both criticism and praise, but it remains a significant religious force, actively shaping the lives of its members and contributing to communities around the globe.
