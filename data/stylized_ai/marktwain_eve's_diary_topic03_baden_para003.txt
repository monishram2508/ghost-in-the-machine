Baden, now there's a place. They call it "Baden-Baden," which, naturally, means "Baden-Baden," because why call a town by one name when you can double it, eh? It's like a dog wagging its tail so hard it almost takes flight. A ridiculous excess, but perhaps that’s the point, isn’t it? Baden-Baden seems dedicated to ridiculous excesses. The air itself is heavy with the scent of money and eau de cologne, a rather unsettling combination if you ask me, like perfuming a bank vault. One expects the very stones to exhale fortunes. The women, oh, the women! Decked out in finery that probably cost more than a working man's house, they glide about the Lichtentaler Allee like peacocks who've just won the lottery. I half expected them to sprout wings and fly off to Paris for a spot of shopping. And the men? Well, they’re usually clinging to the women's arms, looking rather like they’ve just spent the last hour in a hot poker game and lost, only to be consoled by the glimmering prospect of inheriting somebody's fortune in the near future.

The whole place is built around the Roman baths, you see, though I suspect the Romans would choke on their togas if they saw what’s become of the place. Once a spot for communal cleansing, it's now a monument to leisurely decadence, complete with marble columns, whispering attendants, and waters so therapeutic they could probably revive a dead mule. One is encouraged to lounge about, steeping in these alleged miracle waters until one's skin resembles a prune. The casinos, naturally, are the main event. Gleaming like some jeweled predator in the night, they swallow fortunes with the same casual ease that I swallow a cup of coffee. I half expected the roulette wheels to wink and the cards to deal themselves, such is the air of sly cunning that permeates the place. Honestly, one could probably write a tragedy there, a comedy, and a melodrama, all before dinner. It’s a human zoo, really, but a rather well-perfumed one. A most curious town, is Baden-Baden, a place where fortunes are won and lost, schemes are hatched, and one can observe the peculiar habits of the wealthy with a comfortable degree of detachment, provided, of course, one hasn’t spent all one’s money at the tables.
