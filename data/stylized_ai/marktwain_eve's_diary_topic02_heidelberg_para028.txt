Heidelberg, you see, is the very apotheosis of the Rhine’s romantic claptrap, a sort of stage set erected for the express purpose of enchanting tourists and emptying their pocketbooks. One can scarce take a step without stumbling over a picturesque ruin, each more carefully preserved in its state of charming decay than the last. The castle, of course, is the granddaddy of them all, a magnificent wreck perched on a hill like a tipsy giant who's seen one too many bottles of Rhine wine. It’s supposed to inspire awe, and to be fair, it mostly does. One can’t help but be a little awed at the sheer audaciousness of building such a monstrous pile of stone, even if half of it is now crumbling into a delightful jumble of ivy-covered walls. The university, ah, the university! The breeding ground for philosophers and romantic poets, or so they’d have you believe. In reality, I suspect it's more likely a breeding ground for future bureaucrats and purveyors of that peculiarly German brand of earnestness. Still, the student's prison is a diverting enough spectacle, with its walls covered in graffiti and declarations of youthful rebellion. One imagines the poor chaps locked away for dueling infractions, scribbling their grievances on the stone with whatever implement they could lay their hands on. And the Great Vat, what an absurdity! A wine barrel of such preposterous size that it feels almost sacrilegious to even contemplate filling it. It’s about as useful as a chocolate teapot, but immensely more impressive. All in all, Heidelberg is a delightful, albeit somewhat manufactured, experience. It is a place where one can spend hours wandering through cobbled streets, admiring the scenery, and chuckling to oneself at the sheer absurdity of it all. Just be sure to bring your walking shoes and a healthy dose of skepticism, and you’ll find yourself thoroughly entertained, and perhaps even a little bit charmed, despite your best efforts not to be.
