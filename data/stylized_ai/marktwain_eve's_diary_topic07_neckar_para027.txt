The Neckar. Ah, that meandering ribbon of water they call a river, and which, to be perfectly frank, wouldn't raise an eyebrow back in Hannibal, Missouri. But here in this neck of the German woods, pardon the pun, it's quite the celebrated affair. They treat it with a reverence usually reserved for crowned heads and relics claiming to be splinters from the True Cross. I’ve seen ducks with less inflated egos. It flows, bless its heart, from somewhere obscure in the Black Forest – a forest, I might add, that seems less a forest and more a collection of excessively enthusiastic pines – and winds its way past Heidelberg, a town that manages to be both impossibly romantic and crammed tighter than a politician's handshake.

They’ve built castles along its banks, perched precariously like so many drunken uncles trying to balance on a teeter-totter. Each claiming to be the most picturesque, the most historically significant, the most likely to have housed a ghost who whispers secrets about Charlemagne's laundry. Honestly, one loses count after the third ruin. And the tourists! Lord, the tourists flock to it like moths to a questionable flame, snapping photographs of every bridge, every lock, every ripple in the water that might, just possibly, resemble the face of a long-dead baron.

The river traffic, too, is a sight to behold. Little flat-bottomed boats crammed with pale Germans in questionable socks and sandals, serenading the unsuspecting with folksongs so mournful they could curdle milk. And barges, laden with all manner of goods from points unknown, chugging along with the same determined, albeit sluggish, pace as a bureaucrat navigating a particularly thorny piece of legislation. I dare say, the Neckar’s claim to fame rests less on its inherent grandeur and more on its strategic location. A conveniently damp landmark for postcard manufacturers and breweries alike. Still, it’s a pleasant enough distraction, especially if one has a good book, a comfortable chair, and a healthy skepticism for anything touted as “historically significant.” Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear a particularly plaintive rendition of "Lorelei" floating from the direction of the bridge. I shudder to think of the socks that must be accompanying it.
