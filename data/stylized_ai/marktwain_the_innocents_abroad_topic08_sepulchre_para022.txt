Now, a sepulchre, that's a word that can conjure up all sorts of grand and gloomy images, can't it? Sort of makes you think of pharaohs and pyramids and fellas named Tutankhamun, even if half the time it's just old Ebenezer Snodgrass mouldering away in a brick box down at the local boneyard. I reckon the main function of a sepulchre, beyond holding a corpse, is to impress the living. Show off a bit, you see. Nobody builds a sepulchre out of modesty, that's for sure. It’s a monument to vanity, plain and simple, a final, stone-cold advertisement for a life lived, or at least a life that someone *wants* you to think was lived.

You get the fancy kind, of course, the ones with marble angels weeping silently for eternity and inscriptions longer than a Senator's filibuster, all about the deceased's virtues, which, naturally, are always greatly exaggerated. Then you get the plainer variety, more like a glorified shed for the departed, often overgrown with weeds and sporting a tilted headstone that threatens to topple over and squash any curious squirrels that might be poking around. But even the humblest sepulchre holds a tale, doesn't it? A story whispered in the rustle of leaves and the chirp of crickets, a testament to someone who once walked this earth, ate beans, maybe argued with the missus, and ended up in this very spot.

I’ve always found it amusing, this grand effort we put into marking the end. Seems like we're trying to cheat death somehow, to leave a permanent stamp on a world that's constantly forgetting. We carve names in stone, build towering mausoleums, and tell ourselves it's all about remembrance. But let's be honest, ain’t nobody reading those long-winded inscriptions after a generation or two. They are much likely saying, "Well, that's a big rock, bet it was expensive." So, the sepulchre stands, a silent, often-ignored testament to the absurdity of it all, a stone-cold joke played on the departed, who I suppose, are in no position to complain.
