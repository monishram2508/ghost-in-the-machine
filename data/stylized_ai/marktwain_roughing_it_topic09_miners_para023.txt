A miner, now that’s a specimen for ye, a study in grit and grime, with a beard longer than a Sunday sermon and just as meandering. He ain't much for book-learnin', unless it's a ledger balance sheet and he's the one doin' the balanced, mind you. A miner’s idea of poetry is the echoing rumble of dynamite, and his symphony is the clatter of pickaxes against rock. He's a fella who’ll spend his days in the bowels of the earth, chasing after that fickle mistress, Lady Luck, and her shimmering skirts of gold. He'll wager his health, his eyesight, even his patience (which, granted, ain’t much to wager after the first month underground) for the chance to strike it rich. And then, bless his greedy heart, he’ll probably blow it all on whiskey, a fancy saddle, or some dance-hall queen who probably can’t tell a nugget from a nincompoop.

You’ll find ‘em huddled around smoky fires in the evenings, swapping tall tales that’d make Baron Munchausen blush, each claim richer and more outlandish than the last. They’ll argue about the best way to shore up a tunnel, the signs of a good vein, or the proper way to pan for gold - topics of such crucial importance that they'll happily come to blows over them. They are the kings of hyperbole, those fellas, and as loyal as they are stubborn, sticking to their claim even after it's produced less than a rattlesnake with constipation. But God help you if you try to cheat one of 'em, or worse, steal their ore. They might not be gentlemen in the parlor sense, but they’ve got a code, and breaking it will bring more trouble than you can shake a stick of dynamite at. They're a rough bunch, for sure, but underneath the dirt and the dust, there's often a heart of pure gold, or at least, the hope that they’ll find enough to have one cast for them.
