Ballou, now there was a specimen. A tenderfoot fresh off the boat, or rather, fresh off the stagecoach, with a heart full of gold and a head full of... well, let's just say it wasn't crammed to bursting with practical mining knowledge. He arrived in these parts with a trunk full of books – poetry, mostly, stuff about daffodils and lovesick lasses, the kind of reading that would make a seasoned prospector hoot with laughter. He figured he’d strike it rich quoting Shakespeare at the quartz. Lord knows why he chose Nevada, a place where the only sonnets are written in the dust by the wind.

He was about as useful as a silk handkerchief in a dust storm, truth be told. Couldn't swing a pickaxe to save his life, though he swung a mighty fine metaphor, bless his soul. We tried to teach him the ropes, showed him how to pan for gold without losing half the river in the process, but it was like trying to teach a mule to waltz. He'd squint at the mountains, declare them “sublime and indifferent,” then trip over a sagebrush and land face-first in a mud puddle. Always with the poetry, mind you, even when he was covered in muck. "O, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune!" he'd lament, spitting out grit.

He did have a knack for attracting trouble, though. One time, he tried to befriend a coyote, convinced it was just a misunderstood canine in need of a kind word and a biscuit. Ended with him running for his life, pursued by a creature considerably less interested in his literary insights and considerably more interested in his trousers. Despite his blunders, we couldn't help but like the fella. He was harmless as a lamb and enthusiastic as a pup, even if his enthusiasm generally led to disaster. Ballou, bless his simple heart, was a walking, talking advertisement for the notion that you can't fix stupid with a shovel, but you can sure as heck learn to laugh at it. And laugh we did, until our sides ached.
