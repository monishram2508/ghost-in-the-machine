Chamois, agile and graceful ungulates of the genus *Rupicapra*, are iconic inhabitants of the rugged mountainous regions of Europe. These goat-antelopes, characterized by their relatively small size, typically stand around 70-85 centimeters tall at the shoulder and weigh between 25 and 60 kilograms. Their coats, thick and woolly, undergo a seasonal transformation; in summer, they sport a reddish-brown hue, providing camouflage against the sun-drenched rocks and alpine meadows. As winter approaches, their fur thickens and darkens to a near-black, offering insulation against the harsh cold and blending seamlessly with the snow-covered landscape. Both males and females possess short, hooked horns that rise almost vertically from their heads, with the male's horns being slightly thicker and more curved. These horns, composed of keratin, are a permanent feature and continue to grow throughout their lives.

Chamois are exceptionally well-adapted to their precipitous environment. Their sure-footedness is legendary, thanks to specialized hooves with a soft, rubbery core surrounded by a hard rim, providing unparalleled grip on slippery rocks and icy slopes. They are remarkably adept climbers, capable of leaping effortlessly across chasms and scaling near-vertical cliffs. Their keen eyesight and acute senses allow them to detect predators and other dangers from a considerable distance. These animals are predominantly diurnal, spending their days foraging on grasses, herbs, leaves, and buds. Their diet varies depending on the season and availability of vegetation, adapting to the challenges of their alpine habitat. Chamois live in herds, typically consisting of females and their offspring, led by an experienced female. Males usually live solitary lives or form small bachelor groups, only joining the herds during the mating season in late autumn. This period is marked by intense competition among males, who engage in displays of aggression and battles to secure mating rights. The chamois face threats from predators such as wolves, lynx, and golden eagles, and are also vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting pressure, making their conservation a continuous concern in many parts of their range.
