Harris, that fella, bless his simple heart, he’s a specimen, alright. A regular dictionary of good intentions, bound in the leather of utter haplessness. Why, I recollect one time we were fixin’ to go fishin’ down on the Big Muddy. Now, Harris, he insisted, with the vehemence of a preacher denyin’ sin in a cathouse, that he was the authority on bait. Worms, he declared, were pedestrian. Minnows? Common. We needed, according to Harris, a secret concoction known only to the old river folk, a vile brew of spoiled cheese, rancid bacon grease, and somethin’ he called “mystery meat” that smelled suspiciously of last Tuesday’s leftovers.

Of course, he had to brew this catastrophe himself, in the parlor, no less. Claimed the shed wasn’t “suitable for alchemical experimentation.” The result? Well, the parlor looked like a bomb had visited, smelled like a skunk had died of indigestion, and attracted every fly within a five-mile radius. And the fish? They turned up their noses at it faster than a Southern belle at a Yankee picnic. We sat there for hours, baking under the sun, swatting insects, with nary a nibble. Finally, I asked him, “Harris,” I said, “You sure this here’s the magic bait? Seems to me, the only magic it possesses is the ability to repel aquatic life to the next county.”

He scratched his head, looked at the shimmering, untouched sludge on his hook, and said, with a perfectly straight face, “Well, maybe the fish are just bein’ particular today. Or perhaps,” he added, with a conspiratorial wink, “it’s such a delicacy, they’re waitin’ for a formal invitation.” And that’s Harris in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen. A man who can turn disaster into a punchline, and failure into a grand, albeit utterly improbable, adventure. The man could trip over a rainbow and blame the leprechauns for his clumsiness. And you know what? You’d almost believe him.
