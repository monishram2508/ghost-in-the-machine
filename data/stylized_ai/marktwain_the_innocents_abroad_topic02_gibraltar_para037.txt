Gibraltar, bless its heart, is a sight to behold, a veritable lump of limestone poking its nose saucily out of the Mediterranean, like a grumpy old fellow refusing to submerge himself in his bath. They call it the Rock, and rightly so, for it appears about as moveable as a particularly stubborn mule dug in for the afternoon. One imagines even the legendary Hercules, after setting his Pillars, might have scratched his beard and muttered, "Well, dash it all, I'm not moving that." A proper little bastion of Britishness it is, too, clinging tighter to the Empire than a barnacle to a hull, though one suspects the Empire, in its grand and rambling way, has likely misplaced the deed some years ago. The place is crammed with red phone boxes that look suspiciously out of place in the Iberian sun, and blokes in short trousers and pith helmets, perpetuating the stereotype with a dedication that verges on the theatrical. You can nearly smell the tea and crumpets radiating from the place, even if you’re a league away.

The apes, ah, the Barbary apes! Now there's a collection of scoundrels if ever I saw one. They’re billed as the guardians of the Rock, prophesied to vanish only when the British relinquish control. A clever bit of marketing, that, for who wants to be blamed for the demise of such furry, flea-ridden brigands? They’re bolder than a brass band at a funeral, these apes, swaggering about like they own the place, pilfering handbags, and generally making a nuisance of themselves. One can’t help but admire their audacity, though one feels a certain degree of sympathy for the poor souls who dare to venture near them with a biscuit or a shiny button. One can picture these apes in Parliament, really, their manners being of similar quality. The entire place feels like a stage set, really, a delightful anachronism where history and tourism have conspired to create a spectacle that is both charming and utterly absurd. And so, one trundles off, leaving Gibraltar to its rocky fate, its apes, and its unwavering commitment to all things British, shaking one's head and chuckling at the delightful absurdity of it all.
