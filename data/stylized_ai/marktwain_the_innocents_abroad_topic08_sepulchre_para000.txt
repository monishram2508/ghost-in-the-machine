A sepulchre, now there’s a word that sounds far grander than what it typically delivers. Most folks picture some imposing marble edifice, guarded by grim-faced angels and adorned with more filigree than a proper lady’s drawing-room mirror. Reality, bless its contrary heart, usually offers up something less...theatrical. I’ve seen sepulchres looking like overgrown dog kennels, others resembling root cellars that took a wrong turn and ended up housing the dearly departed instead of potatoes. One out in Hannibal, I recall, was about the size of a decent privy, though infinitely more permanent. The fella inside, a Judge Thompson, had been mighty proud of it, supposedly commissioning it years before his appointment with the Grim Reaper. Claimed he wanted a final resting place befitting a man of his stature. Well, seeing it, one couldn’t help but wonder if the Judge's self-assessment hadn't been a tad inflated. I reckon he was a fine Judge and all, but his sepulchre suggested he’d overestimated his future real estate needs considerably. Then there’s the inscription business. Some folks go for solemn pronouncements about eternal peace and remembrance. Others get downright sentimental, even maudlin. I recall one particularly verbose fellow, a banker by trade, had his entire life story etched onto his tomb, including a detailed account of his investments and a rather unconvincing claim to have single-handedly saved the local orphanage from ruin. Talk about advertising in perpetuity! Gives a fella pause, it does. Makes you wonder if we ain’t all just trying to impress the worms with our resumes. And that, I suspect, is the true tragedy of the sepulchre: not its cold stone or its somber purpose, but the vanity that often builds it. We spend our lives striving to be remembered, yet ultimately, the grandest sepulchre, the most eloquent inscription, is just another forgotten monument in the endless parade of time. Now, ain't that a dandy thought to chew on over supper?
