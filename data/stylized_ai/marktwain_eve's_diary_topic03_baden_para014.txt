Baden, ah Baden! A place where one might expect to find a veritable Eden, what with the name and all, hinting at leafy bowers and forbidden fruit. But let me tell you, the forbidden fruit here is more likely to be a particularly pungent Limburger cheese left a touch too long in the sun, and the leafy bowers resemble nothing so much as meticulously trimmed shrubbery, all lined up like well-behaved soldiers awaiting inspection. It is, in essence, a town utterly devoted to its spa-going self, a town positively saturated in the business of taking the waters and letting them do, well, goodness only knows what, but I suspect it involves a great deal of discreet napping and the occasional muttered complaint about the sulfurous aroma. One sees a parade of humanity, each face etched with a mixture of hope and resignation, shuffling towards the baths, clutching their towels like shields against the inevitable disappointment that no amount of bubbling water can truly cure the human condition.

The men, bless their souls, sport mustaches that could catch a decent breeze, and the women, bless theirs even more, are decked out in hats that would make a peacock blush. And the promenades! Oh, the promenades are a spectacle unto themselves. Endless streams of finely dressed individuals, determined to demonstrate their vitality by walking very slowly, pausing frequently to admire a flowerbed or exchange a bit of gossip so juicy it could ripen a plum. One feels, upon witnessing this daily ritual, that time itself has decided to take a lengthy vacation, perhaps to a less thoroughly sanitized corner of the world where one might actually perspire without feeling vaguely ashamed. Baden, you see, is a place where discomfort is considered a sign of weakness, where the only acceptable emotion is a sort of polite, vaguely bewildered contentment. It is, in its own peculiar way, a rather charming sort of purgatory, a waiting room for a life that may or may not ever truly begin. But at least the water is warm, and the hats are quite splendid.
