Them miners, now there's a breed of cat peculiar enough to warrant study, and I reckon I've studied 'em enough to fill a book—though Lord knows, book learnin' ain't worth a pinch of snuff when you're standin' face-to-face with a feller whose dug half his life outta the innards of the earth. You'd find 'em clustered thick as fleas on a mangy dog 'round every strike worth a hoot, lookin' for that El Dorado. They came from every corner of the earth, too, speakin' languages that'd make your ears curl backwards, all united by a single, unwavering belief: that tomorrow, maybe tomorrow, they'd strike it rich. Now, most of 'em wouldn't find enough gold to fill a tooth, let alone retire on, but that didn't stop 'em from tryin', bless their optimistic hearts.

A miner's dress was a sight to behold: patched britches held up by hope and a belt buckle the size of a dinner plate, a flannel shirt dirtier than a pig in a mud wallow, and boots that had seen more miles underground than a prairie dog. And the language! You could learn more cuss words in an hour in a mining camp than you would in a year at Sunday School, though I reckon a few of those Sunday School preachers could give 'em a run for their money when the collection plate came around. They were a superstitious bunch, too. Never whistle in a mine, never let a woman underground, and always knock three times before startin' to dig –lest you want bad luck to follow you like a shadow. And they had a tall tale for every occasion, each one wilder than the last, spun around a campfire with a bottle of rotgut whiskey, making you wonder if half of what they said was true, or if they were just tryin' to see how far they could stretch the truth before it snapped back and bit 'em. But honest, they were the salt of the earth and without them, this whole grand western escapade would be nothing more than tumbleweeds and empty dreams.
