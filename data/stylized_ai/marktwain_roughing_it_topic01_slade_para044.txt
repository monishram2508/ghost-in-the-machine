Slade, now there was a station that could make a saint swear. Situated like a pimple on the backside of nowhere, it offered precious little besides dust, desperadoes, and a depot that looked like it'd been built by a blind carpenter after a particularly nasty binge of rotgut. The water, when you could find it, tasted suspiciously of alkali and regret, and the beef they served at the Overland Stage station seemed to have been personally acquainted with Methuselah. I reckoned that beef saw the flood. The flies, bless their persistent little souls, were thick as thieves, and twice as annoying, clinging to you with a tenacity that suggested they’d been waiting their whole buzzing lives for just this very opportunity.

Now, the citizenry... well, let's just say that Slade didn't attract the Sunday school set. You had your share of broken-down prospectors, their eyes glazed over with the shimmering mirage of gold, and a collection of hard-eyed fellows who looked like they’d wrestled grizzly bears for breakfast and lost. One gent, named 'Whispering' Pete, claimed to have a silver mine the size of Rhode Island, but the only silver I ever saw him handling was the occasional coin he’d conned out of some greenhorn. And the saloons! Oh, the saloons were a sight to behold. Dimly lit, smoky dens of iniquity where whiskey flowed freely, cards were dealt with suspicious dexterity, and arguments were settled with a swiftness that rarely involved judges or juries. I once saw a fellow get shot for accusing another of cheating at Faro. Quickest trial I ever witnessed, and the executioner had the most beautiful pearl-handled revolver you ever did see. All in all, Slade was a reminder that civilization hadn’t quite gotten around to taming this part of the world yet, and judging by the looks of it, it wasn’t in any particular hurry to start.
