Zermatt, they call it. A village clinging to the skirts of the Matterhorn like a lovesick calf to its mother. Swiss, of course. Everything impossibly tidy, and ridiculously priced. One might suppose that breathing the air there warrants a bill of charges, detailing cubic meters inhaled and an exorbitant supplemental tax for the privilege of viewing the aforementioned Matterhorn while doing so. It's a place where one can spend a king's ransom on a sausage and a lukewarm tankard of something they call "beer," which seems to have been diluted with glacial meltwater and the earnest hope of a hearty, yet gullible, tourist. The locals, bless their industrious souls, are forever polishing things. I swear, I saw a man polishing a rock with a toothbrush. A rock! It's a peculiar sort of dedication, I must say, though one suspects it’s more a means of appearing busy than a genuine passion for geological luminescence.

Transportation, naturally, is accomplished by vehicles powered by electricity, lest the delicate sensibilities of the mountain air be offended by combustion engines. One can't even cough too loudly, lest the avalanche risk assessment be raised. The whole place feels like a meticulously crafted diorama, a miniature alpine paradise designed solely to elicit gasps of manufactured wonderment and the frantic extraction of wallets. And yet, dash it all, it *is* rather stunning. The Matterhorn, despite its ubiquity on postcards and chocolate wrappers, manages to hold a certain dignity. It looms there, a jagged tooth against the cerulean sky, daring you to doubt its grandeur even as you choke on the price of a cup of coffee at its foot. The skiers, of course, are out in force, looking unnervingly like brightly colored beetles scuttling down icy slopes. They whoosh and whizz by, radiating an air of intense athletic purpose and the subtle, but undeniable, odor of eau de sunscreen. Yes, Zermatt is a pocket-sized paradise that charges you dearly for the privilege of existing within its snowy confines. A perfect example of what happens when beauty and commerce collide in a head-on, slightly absurd, and utterly unavoidable fashion.
