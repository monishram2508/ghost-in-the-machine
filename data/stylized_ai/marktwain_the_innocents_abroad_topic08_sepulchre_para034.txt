Well, sir, a sepulchre. Now there's a word that rolls off the tongue like a marble down a staircase, all solemn and echoing. Folks build 'em, don’t they? Grand, imposing affairs usually, meant to shout to the ages, "Here lies somebody important! Don't you forget it!" Though, truth be told, I reckon the truly important folks don't need a fancy house of stone to prove their worth. Lincoln, for instance, he lies in a tomb alright, but his real memorial is etched in the hearts of every free man and woman, and a story told about a stovepipe hat. But I digress.

You see these sepulchres scattered across the globe, from the pyramids of Egypt to the family plots in backwoods graveyards, and you can't help but wonder what it all signifies. Is it love? Is it vanity? Is it fear of being forgotten so soon after the worms have had their fill? Probably a little of each, seasoned with a healthy dose of societal pressure. After all, what would the neighbors say if old Ebenezer got buried in just a plain wooden box like some pauper? Scandalous, I tell you!

And the expense! Lord have mercy, some of these tombs cost more than a steamboat captain's salary. You'd think the deceased was planning on hosting a posthumous cocktail party for the angels. Marble pillars, sculpted figures weeping eternally, inscriptions longer than a Mississippi riverboat’s manifest… it’s a right circus of ornamentation. One wonders if the departed even appreciates the grandeur, being, as they are, indisposed for any further appraisals. Perhaps they're too busy figuring out whether those pearly gates are made of genuine pearl or just cleverly painted imitation. I suppose we will find out when we ourselves have moved on to the other side. Until then, I'll content myself with observing these elaborate mausoleums from a safe distance, chuckling to myself and wondering if the occupants ever get tired of the view. Or the company of the worms. They are, after all, dedicated and silent companions.
