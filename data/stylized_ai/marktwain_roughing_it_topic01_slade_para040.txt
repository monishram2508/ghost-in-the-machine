Slade, that miserable pile of rocks and rot, perched like a buzzard on the edge of the Great Basin, ain't much to write home about, unless your home happens to be a similarly desolate and depraved corner of the earth. I reckon it boasts a population of…well, counting the lizards and stray dogs, and generously including that fella who talks to the sagebrush, we might be pushing a hundred souls. A hundred souls and a thousand whiskey bottles, that is. The saloons, now there’s where the civilization resides, flickering like a dying candle in a hurricane of dust and despair. Each one boasts its own brand of rotgut, guaranteed to either cure what ails ya, or introduce ya to a whole new set of ailments you never knew you could suffer. I spent a week there, long enough to learn the names of most of the inhabitants and forget half of my own. Met a fella who claimed to be a retired dentist – said he pulled teeth with a pair of rusty pliers and a healthy dose of bribery. I believed him, too, looking at the state of the citizenry's choppers. The claim to fame of Slade, aside from its sheer ugliness, is that it’s a “jumping off” point. Jumping off, indeed, more like being pushed off into the vast, unforgiving nothingness. Folks pass through, dreaming of silver strikes and easy fortune, their eyes shining with that fool's gold gleam. They either strike it rich, get eaten by coyotes, or simply fade into the landscape like a forgotten prospector’s ghost. Most of ‘em, I wager, end up in the third category. Leaving Slade is like shedding a skin, a nasty, itchy skin you're glad to be rid of. I won't say I'd never go back, but I'd certainly prefer being tarred and feathered first. And I've heard tales of Slade getting tarred and feathered itself, and it ain't improved its disposition one bit.
