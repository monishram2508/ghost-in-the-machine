Zermatt, you say? A village clinging to the foot of that monstrous Matterhorn like a barnacle on a whale, only infinitely more charming, and less likely to be scraped off. They say it’s a place where the air is so pure, a fellow could actually breathe, which, considering the general state of affairs elsewhere, is no small miracle, let me tell you. Carriages! Carriages as far as the eye can see, pulled by these patient, phlegmatic horses who seem to understand they are the only respectable motorized conveyance allowed in this cobbled haven. Imagine, no infernal combustion engines coughing and sputtering, just the rhythmic clop-clop of hooves and the gentle jingle of harness bells. It’s enough to make a man sentimental, almost. And the hotels! Grand palaces rising from the valley floor like gingerbread castles spun from a pastry chef’s dream, each one vying for the title of “Most Swiss-ly Ostentatious.” Inside, you'll find enough velvet and polished wood to make a lumber baron weep with envy. But the true spectacle, naturally, are the tourists. Bless their hearts, they arrive burdened with more luggage than a travelling circus, their cheeks flushed with the altitude and the sheer novelty of not being flattened by a motorcar every five minutes. They wander about in their fashionable, yet patently impractical, mountaineering gear, looking as if they expect the Matterhorn to simply curtsy in acknowledgement of their stylish arrival. And the restaurants! The fondue, oh the fondue! I confess, I indulged. Dipping anything and everything into molten cheese, the very act a ritual of communal gluttony that binds strangers together in a sticky, pungent union. One almost expects to hear yodeling erupt spontaneously from the nearest table. But then, in Zermatt, anything seems possible. Even the impossible. Especially when you consider they’ve managed to keep automobiles at bay. That alone, I daresay, is a miracle of Swiss proportions.
