Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked souls, are a curious lot, and no mistake. Imagine, if you will, a fellow draped in enough cloth to outfit a small sailing vessel, his face as weathered as a forgotten tombstone, astride a camel that looks as though it’s contemplating the futility of existence with every weary blink. That's your typical Bedouin, at least the ones I've had the misfortune--or perhaps the considerable fortune--of encountering in my wanderings. They're roamers, these fellows, drifting across the desert sands like tumbleweeds with a destination, though whether they know where they’re headed is a question for the ages. They call themselves "people of the tent," and truly, their homes are miracles of portability. One moment, you're staring at a bare patch of sand, the next, poof! A tent appears, seemingly conjured from thin air by some desert sorcery. Though, truth be told, it's probably just a matter of skillful folding and a healthy dose of Bedouin ingenuity.

Their hospitality, I must admit, is a thing to behold. Even if they're poorer than a church mouse on a Tuesday, they'll offer you dates sweeter than a politician's promises and coffee strong enough to wake the dead. Just be warned, accepting their offer means you're obligated to sit cross-legged on a rug, listening to tales of daring raids and family lineages stretching back to the dawn of time. And Heaven forbid you refuse a cup of coffee! That's an insult that could launch a thousand camel caravans into war. Their sense of time, too, is a marvel. Ask them how long it will take to reach the nearest oasis, and they'll likely respond with something like, "Oh, about the time it takes for a camel to get thirsty and then forget he was thirsty." Which, as you can imagine, isn't the most precise measurement. But there you have it, the Bedouin, a desert riddle wrapped in a cloak of dust, whose very existence is a testament to the enduring human spirit, and a darn good source of bemusement, I say.
