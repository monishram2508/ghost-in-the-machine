Now, a sepulchre, that's a word that sounds a mite grander than it often deserves, don't it? Conjures up images of Pharaohs resting easy in pyramids bigger than a good-sized county, or perhaps a Roman Emperor surrounded by enough gold trinkets to sink a steamboat. But truth be told, a sepulchre can be a surprisingly modest affair. I reckon I’ve seen sepulchres that were less impressive than a chicken coop, and about as structurally sound. Some folks, blessed with more ambition than sense, try to elevate 'em with fancy stonework and Latin inscriptions nobody can read anymore. All that money spent on dead languages when you could be investing in, say, a decent spittoon? Seems a mite foolish.

Of course, the real beauty, or lack thereof, in a sepulchre ain't just the stone or the inscription, it's the story it tells, or doesn't tell. I once saw one belonging to a fella who claimed to be descended from royalty. The sepulchre itself was gaudy as a peacock in a thunderstorm, but the inscription? Just his name and the date of his passing. No mention of the royal blood, no heroic deeds, not even a "Here lies a good egg" or "He paid his debts, mostly." Just a blank slate, whispering that maybe, just maybe, his regal lineage was a tale taller than a Mississippi riverboat.

And that's the funny thing about these final resting places. They're supposed to be about permanence, about marking a life lived, but more often than not, they end up being about speculation. We look at the stone, we read the words, and we fill in the blanks with our own stories, our own judgments. We turn the dead into characters in a play we write ourselves, based on the barest of clues. So, next time you find yourself pondering the mysteries of mortality at a sepulchre, remember to take it all with a grain of salt. After all, the best stories, the ones that truly last, are rarely carved in stone, they are whispered around the cracker barrel, and embellished with each telling.
