The Neckar, now there’s a river for you, though I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a Mississippi. It ain't grand, you see, not in the manner of a roaring, mud-laden beast carving its way through half a continent. More like a well-behaved child, dutifully flowing past vineyards and castles, as if worried it might spill its drink on somebody's finery. I watched it meander about, past Heidelberg, that town piled high with history and tourists, each one snapping pictures as if the old ruins might vanish any minute. The river itself seemed to be saying, "Carry on, carry on, just try not to fall in." There were swans, naturally. Every proper river has swans, the more arrogant, the better. These were particularly proud fellows, looking down their beaks at the ducks like they were common trash. One nearly pecked my hat off, I swear, just for the audacity of existing in its vicinity. There were pleasure boats, too, fat things chugging along, filled with Germans diligently enjoying their leisure time. Each clutched a stein of something brown and foamy, faces flushed pink, singing songs that sounded suspiciously alike. I thought to myself, "Now, there's a river that knows its place, facilitating the orderly consumption of beer and the mild appreciation of scenery." It’s not the sort of river that inspires epics or tales of daring adventure, mind you. You won’t find any Huck Finns rafting down the Neckar, dodging runaway barges and feuding families. It’s more the sort of river that inspires a quiet Sunday afternoon, a gentle stroll along its banks, and perhaps a half-hearted attempt at philosophical contemplation before the call of schnitzel proves too strong. Yes, the Neckar, a river of moderation, good manners, and the quiet appreciation of a life well-ordered, even if it does lack a certain... *oomph*. A perfectly respectable river, all things considered, but hardly likely to set the world, or even a small fishing boat, on fire.
