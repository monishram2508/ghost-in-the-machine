Now, Galilee, that's a region that sounds Biblical, and bless my soul, it is! A place where, according to the Good Book, miracles bloomed like wildflowers in springtime – and probably just as unexpectedly. They say the Savior himself spent a good portion of his earthly sojourn there, preaching and performing wonders amongst the fishermen and farmers. Fishermen, mind you, not the highfalutin sort with yachts and caviar dreams, but the kind who smelled of brine and honest labor, their nets heavier with perch than promises of salvation. 

I must confess, on my own pilgrimage, I didn't see any water turning into wine, though I certainly sampled some local varieties that could have fooled me into thinking they had. Nor did I encounter any loaves and fishes multiplying before my very eyes, though the restaurant portions, bless their generous hearts, came darn close. The Sea of Galilee, or Lake Kinneret as the locals stubbornly insist on calling it (as if renaming it would somehow improve its scenery), is a pleasant body of water. Pleasant, mind you, not breathtaking. It's no Niagara, no Caribbean turquoise. It’s more the sort of lake a weary traveler might appreciate after a long dusty ride on a cantankerous mule. 

The hills surrounding it, well, they’re just hills. Brownish, mostly, with a smattering of greenery that looks as though it's perpetually apologizing for not being more lush. But it's the *idea* of Galilee, the historical significance, that truly grips a fellow. You see those humble slopes and imagine a throng of hopefuls listening to the Sermon on the Mount, or picture Peter hauling in a net full of fish, then promptly abandoning it all to follow a carpenter. Then you remember your sore feet, the relentless sun, and the persistent hawkers selling "authentic" relics made in China. But still, you can't help but feel a little…something. A little bit closer to the source of all those tall tales, a little bit like you've walked where giants walked, even if they were wearing sandals instead of sensible boots. And that, my friends, is worth a bit of sunburn and a dubious souvenir or two.
