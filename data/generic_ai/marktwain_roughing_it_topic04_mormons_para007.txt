Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, originated in the United States in the 19th century with Joseph Smith. Smith claimed to have received visitations from God and Jesus Christ, as well as an angel named Moroni, who revealed the location of golden plates inscribed with ancient religious writings. These plates were purportedly translated by Smith into what became the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible by adherents. Central to Mormon theology is the belief in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, emphasizing the ongoing revelation from God through prophets and apostles. They believe that the original Christian church fell into apostasy after the death of the original apostles and that Smith was chosen to restore its fullness.

Mormon doctrine includes unique elements such as the concept of pre-mortal existence, where spirits lived with God before birth, and the potential for eternal progression and exaltation to godhood. Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving voluntary missions for two years, proselytizing and engaging in humanitarian work across the globe. Socially, the church promotes strong family values, abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, and emphasizes community involvement. Temples hold a special place in Mormon life, being considered sacred houses of worship where ordinances such as baptisms for the dead and eternal marriages are performed. The church has a hierarchical leadership structure, with local congregations overseen by bishops and higher authorities guiding the global organization. Over time, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has evolved and grown significantly, becoming a global religion with millions of members worldwide, and its beliefs and practices have often been the subject of both fascination and controversy. The church places a strong emphasis on education, charitable giving, and promoting positive values within its membership and the wider community.
