Well, I did strike out for Utah once, hopin' to see these Mormons and their promised land with my own two peepers. Heard tell of 'em bein' a peculiar lot, these Saints, with their Brigham Young and their books nobody could rightly decipher. Some folks claimed they were saints alright, dipped in gold and floatin' on celestial clouds. Others, and I reckon there's more truth in this camp, figured 'em for shrewd farmers and canny businessmen, buildin' an empire where nothin' but sagebrush used to dare grow.

Salt Lake City, now that's a sight. Streets wide enough to turn a stagecoach, houses neat as pins in a preacher's Sunday coat, and ditches carryin' water every which way. It's a danged sight more organized than most places I’ve seen that pride themselves on civilization. Brigham, they say, had a hand in everythin'. He knew how many beans made five and how many wives a man could handle before his temper turned sour. Speaking of wives, that's where the fuss generally started. Plural marriage they called it, a system that either made a man a king or drove him clean daft. I met a fellow who claimed to have thirteen wives. Claimed he spent most of his nights figuring out who got the feather bed and who got the pallet on the floor. He looked perpetually tired, like a badger that'd been chasing rabbits all day.

But aside from the marital arrangements, which seemed complicated as a politician's promise, they were hospitable folk. Always ready with a cup of lukewarm coffee made from roasted wheat (a concoction I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy) and a tale or two about the travails of trekkin' across the plains. They worked hard, these Mormons, and they believed, by golly, that they were buildin' Zion. Whether Zion was what they thought it was, or just a well-irrigated patch of desert with a lot of beehives, well, that’s a question I ain’t fit to answer. But one thing's certain, they were buildin' somethin', and they were buildin' it together, come hell or high water, or even a United States marshal or two.
