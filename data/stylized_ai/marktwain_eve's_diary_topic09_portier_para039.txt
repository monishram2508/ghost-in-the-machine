Now, about that Portier fellow. I reckon he was one of those meticulously-inclined chaps, the sort who'd measure the distance between their butter pats and the edge of their bread plate with a slide ruler. You’d find him perched on a tall ladder, not painting landscapes, no siree, but adjusting a curtain, a drape mind you, and not just any old homespun rag, but a proper portière, the kind that's meant to keep out a draft, or perhaps an unwanted in-law. He fussed and fiddled with it like it was the fate of the Republic hinging on its precise placement. One might think he was building the Hoover Dam with cloth and rings! He’d squint, tilt his head, and hum a tune that sounded suspiciously like a death march for dust bunnies.

I once observed him over in Mrs. Higginbottom's parlour, a place so suffocatingly over-decorated that a canary would suffocate from sheer floral density. He was there to "optimise the environmental dynamics," as he put it, which translated to moving the portière three inches to the left. Three inches! I nearly choked on my sarsaparilla. He explained, with a solemnity usually reserved for Presidential pronouncements, that this alteration would redirect the afternoon sunbeams and thus enhance the chromatic resonance of Mrs. Higginbottom's prize-winning geranium. Now, I'm no botanist, but I suspect that geranium would have been just as happy basking in the un-optimised sunlight. But who am I to question a man so dedicated to the science of drapery? Perhaps in his own mind, he was a sculptor of atmosphere, a Michelangelo of muslin. The whole affair, I must confess, struck me as profoundly silly, and I found myself stifling a giggle behind my fan, fearing that he would next calculate the exact angle at which my mirth might disrupt the portière’s carefully orchestrated airflow. Bless his heart though; if arranging curtains was his mountain to climb, well, I reckon he climbed it with the gusto of a squirrel raiding a nut hoard.
