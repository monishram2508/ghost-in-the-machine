Zermatt, you see, is a place so relentlessly picturesque it fairly aches to be taken with a grain of salt, or perhaps several, washed down with a generous glug of something restorative. It sits there, a village nestled betwixt mountains that would make even the most jaded celestial architect pause for admiration, like a jewel dropped carelessly into a velvet-lined box. And speaking of boxes, one might remark that the place is positively stuffed with chalets, each striving for architectural perfection as if competing for a prize awarded by Saint Peter himself. The air, oh, the air! It is so pure, so clean, that one feels morally obliged to cough just to remind oneself that one is still mortal and prone to such earthly failings. 

Of course, the true marvel, the real reason folks willingly abandon their drawing rooms and venture to this precipitous perch, is the Matterhorn. That granite behemoth, sticking up like a giant’s thumb daring the heavens to give him a high-five. They say it’s majestic. They say it’s awe-inspiring. And I suppose it is, in the way a particularly aggressive rooster is awe-inspiring. But let’s be honest, it’s also rather… pointy. And relentlessly there. One can scarcely turn around without that stony finger wagging a silent scolding.

And the people! Oh, the people. Bundled in furs and armed with walking sticks that look suspiciously like weapons against rogue glaciers, they stride about with an air of purpose that suggests they are personally responsible for keeping the Matterhorn from tumbling down and crushing the entire village. They purchase souvenirs with the fervent dedication of pilgrims acquiring relics, little Matterhorn trinkets that will, no doubt, find their way into dusty drawers to be rediscovered years hence with a vague sense of bewilderment. One cannot help but wonder if they truly appreciate the place, or if they are merely performing the obligatory tourist ritual, checking off another box on their grand tour of manufactured wonders. But, perhaps, that is simply the cynicism of a seasoned traveler, a malady best cured with another glug and a fresh perspective. For even the most jaded heart, I suspect, cannot remain entirely unmoved by the sheer, audacious beauty of Zermatt. Though, one might discreetly snicker behind a gloved hand, just to maintain a semblance of balance.
