Well, I do declare, this glacier is a sight, ain’t it? Like a colossal wedding cake left out in the rain for, oh, a thousand years or so. Except instead of sugary frosting, it's all this frozen…stuff. They call it ice, I suppose, but it looks more like what would happen if you tried to make a river out of diamonds and gave up halfway through, then someone big enough stomped on it to flatten it out. And the color! You’d think something made of water would be clear, maybe a bit sparkly, but no, this glacier is the color of a disapproving aunt’s best china – a sort of grayish-blue that suggests it knows something scandalous about you and is just waiting for the opportune moment to reveal it to the whole picnic.

And the way it moves! Now, some folks claim it's swift as a hummingbird's wing, but I'd say it's more like a particularly stubborn mule, inching along at its own sweet time. "Geological time," they call it. I reckon that's just a fancy way of saying it'll get there eventually, maybe by the time my great-great-grandchildren are pushing up daisies. Though, I confess, even I, with my womanly and limited mental capacity, can understand the consequences of that creeping. It’s like watching a slow-motion disaster unfold, carving out valleys and scattering rocks like a child throwing a tantrum with a box of toys. They say it's a natural process, but I can't help feeling like it's all a bit…showy. Like it's trying to impress us with its brute strength, reminding us that we’re just temporary residents on this earth, whilst it's going to stick around long enough to see the sun grow cold. Still, I have to admire the sheer doggedness of it all. If nothing else, it shows you what you can accomplish if you just keep at it, even if "it" is turning an entire landscape into a gravel pit at a snail's pace.
