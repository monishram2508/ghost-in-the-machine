Now, about this portiere, this drape, this flouncy barrier betwixt one room and t'other. Lord, what a fuss mankind does make over such trifles! It's meant, I suppose, to offer a smidge of privacy, to shield the delicate sensibilities from the coarse reality of the hallway. Like a fig leaf for the parlor door, if you please. Adam, bless his heart, just needed a leaf. We women, oh, we need yards of damask and tassels, and possibly a small, trained monkey to hold it back for important callers.

I recall a time, back when I was still calling myself “Mrs. Adam,” mind you, when we attempted to acquire a portiere. Adam, bless his innocent soul, thought a plain, unbleached linen would suffice. "Practical, Eve," he declared. "Sturdy, unpretentious." As if a bit of cloth could ever truly be those things! The angels, witnessing our debate from the celestial galleries, must have nearly choked on their ambrosia with laughter. Why, a plain linen portiere is practically an invitation for dust mites to throw a hoedown.

It took me a week, and a bit of judicious weeping (perfectly executed, if I do say so myself), to convince him that we needed something with a bit more... presence. Something that suggested we had secrets to hide, even if those secrets were merely the location of the best apples in the garden. Finally, we settled on a velvet monstrosity, the color of bruised plums, adorned with enough fringe to clothe a tribe of pygmies. It was utterly ridiculous, of course, but it did keep the draft out, and more importantly, it gave the impression that we were people of substance, even if our substance was mostly composed of righteous guilt and a penchant for forbidden fruit. And let me tell you, Adam tripped over that fringe more times than I can count. Serves him right, really, for not appreciating the importance of a good, solid, utterly impractical portiere.
