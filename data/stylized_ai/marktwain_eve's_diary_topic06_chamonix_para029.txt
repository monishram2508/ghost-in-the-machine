Now, Chamonix, you say. A right curious place it is, perched there at the foot of that Mont Blanc – a mountain so outrageously tall it appears to be permanently showing off. One can scarcely glance in its direction without feeling a mite insignificant, as if nature herself is chuckling at our puny human endeavors. The town itself, bless its heart, is a veritable anthill of activity, swarming with these athletic sorts, all bundled up in more layers than an onion and talking a strange lingo I believe they call “outdoor enthusiast.” They’re forever strapping themselves to skis, or crampons, or whatever other devilish contraptions they’ve devised to conquer the Alps, looking as serious as undertakers. One half expects them to spontaneously combust from sheer exertion.

They seem to enjoy it, though. At least, they claim to. Perhaps it's the thin air addling their brains, or maybe they are just particularly fond of paying exorbitant prices for equipment that will inevitably end up gathering dust in their attics. I did see one chap, however, attempting to navigate the cobblestone streets in his ski boots, the poor fellow looked as graceful as a newborn giraffe. The shopkeepers, of course, are beaming from ear to ear, counting their profits with the glee of a miser who's just discovered a hidden hoard. One can hardly blame them, I suppose; if people are foolish enough to pay a king's ransom for a pair of woolen socks, who are we to stop them? And the cafes, oh, the cafes! Brimming with rosy-cheeked adventurers recounting tales of daring-do and near-death experiences, all fueled by copious amounts of vin chaud. It’s all a bit like watching a play, really – a grand spectacle of human aspiration and the occasional spectacular face-plant. A truly remarkable place, Chamonix. You’ll find yourself shaking your head and chuckling, all at the same time.
