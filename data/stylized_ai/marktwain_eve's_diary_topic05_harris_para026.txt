Harris, now there's a specimen. A man of industry, they say, though I suspect his industry consists primarily of devising new and ingenious ways to avoid actual toil. He’s got that look about him, you know, the kind that suggests he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, promptly swallowed it whole, and now spends his days trying to convince everyone it was only a tooth filling. He’s a walking encyclopedia of useless knowledge, mind you. Ask him the mating habits of the Lesser Spotted Mudskipper, and he’ll hold forth for a good half hour, complete with diagrams drawn in the air with his index finger. But ask him to mend a leaky faucet, and he'll suddenly develop a pressing engagement involving a rare species of butterfly fluttering desperately for its life in the next county.

He possesses an uncanny ability to be right, or at least to appear so, long after the facts have decisively proven him wrong. It's a talent that would make a politician green with envy. I recall one unfortunate incident concerning a misplaced map, where he confidently declared the river flowed north, leading us all into a swamp infested with more mosquitoes than stars in the heavens. Upon emerging, scratched, bitten, and utterly disillusioned, we discovered the river, naturally, flowed south. His explanation? A plausible theory involving magnetic anomalies and the migratory patterns of subterranean eels. He offered it with such conviction that, for a brief, unsettling moment, I nearly believed him.

He’s a good sort, though, in his own peculiar way. Like a rusty old blunderbuss – loud, unpredictable, and possibly dangerous, but ultimately harmless, especially if kept at a safe distance. You can’t help but chuckle at his antics, even when they’re causing you considerable inconvenience. Besides, misery loves company, and Harris provides it in abundance. It's like having a walking, talking disaster alongside you, ensuring that whatever woes befall you, at least you're not the only one knee-deep in the swamp of misfortune. And there's a certain comfort in that, a perverse sort of camaraderie forged in the fires of shared calamity. So, yes, Harris. A curious creation, indeed. One that leaves you pondering the mysteries of the universe, and wondering just how he managed to talk his way out of that latest predicament.
