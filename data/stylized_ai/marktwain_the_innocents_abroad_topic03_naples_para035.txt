Naples, ah, a city that assaults the senses like a rogue opera singer hitting a high note only dogs can truly appreciate. One ventures into its maw expecting art and history, and finds, well, history alright, layered upon itself like a mille-feuille pastry that's been repeatedly dropped in the street. The streets themselves! Narrow, winding things they are, as if designed by a drunken spider after a particularly potent batch of limoncello. Carriages, carts, and Vespas jostle for supremacy, each driver seemingly operating under the delusion that his is the only vehicle that matters. The din is incessant, a cacophony of shouting vendors hawking wares I couldn’t identify if my life depended on it, mingled with the operatic wail of mothers calling after children who, truth be told, appear to be operating under a similar state of chaotic self-determination as the drivers.

Then there are the buildings, a hodgepodge of architectural styles, ranging from the grand and decaying to the positively ramshackle. Laundry hangs from balconies like flags of surrender to grime and gravity, and the air is thick with the aroma of frying garlic, exhaust fumes, and something vaguely…marine. One suspects that if Vesuvius were to rumble again, Naples would shrug and carry on, perhaps pausing only to collect any stray tomatoes that might have fallen from a passing cart, figuring they could use them in the ragu. The Neapolitans themselves are a study in contrasts. They possess a certain…theatricality, gesturing wildly, speaking with the passion of lovers or rivals, and seemingly unafraid to express their opinions on any subject, from the quality of the day’s catch to the current state of papal affairs. Beggars plead with the fervor of Shakespearean actors, and pickpockets operate with the grace of seasoned ballet dancers. It's a city that tries one's patience, tests one's bladder control, and quite possibly shortens one's lifespan, but confound it all, it's utterly unforgettable. One leaves Naples feeling slightly soiled, slightly bewildered, and secretly longing to return, just to be thoroughly and hilariously perplexed all over again.
