Ballou, now there was a specimen. You wouldn’t find him stuffed in a museum, mind you, though he deserved a place amongst the oddities. Came out to Nevada with us, ostensibly to try his hand at mining – an ambition about as suited to him as a silk hat on a jackrabbit. Had a constitution delicate as a hummingbird's bone, and a sense of direction so atrocious, a blind mule could've navigated better. He was forever losing himself, turning up days later looking like he’d wrestled a bear and lost, babbling something about following a "magnetic north" that clearly only existed in his imagination. The man could trip over a level floor, and once, I swear, I saw him get lost inside a ten-foot-square cabin.

He possessed this peculiar talent, too, for attracting misfortune like a honey-pot draws flies. Whatever could go wrong, invariably DID go wrong for Ballou. One time, he decided to learn to ride a horse, convinced he’d be a regular bronco-buster. That horse, bless its equine heart, seemed to take an immediate dislike to him. It bucked him off so hard, he landed in a patch of prickly pear cactus, looking like a pincushion gone wrong. Another time, prospecting for gold, he blasted a hole so large, he practically created a new canyon. Turns out, he’d detonated a whole lot of nothin’ but rock and wasted powder – enough powder, mind you, to blow San Francisco clear off the map.

But here’s the rub, despite all his failings, his clumsiness, his downright talent for disaster, you couldn't help but like the feller. He had this innocent, guileless quality about him, like a child let loose in a hardware store. And he’d always dust himself off, patch himself up, and try again, with a hopeful gleam in his eye. He was a persistent idiot, if you get my meaning, a walking, talking, calamity just begging for a new chance to make a bigger, better mess. He never found gold, never tamed a horse, and never quite managed to find his way out of a paper bag, but he was, in his own peculiar way, a landmark.
