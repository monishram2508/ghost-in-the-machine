Harris, now, he was a specimen, a genuine article, a contradiction walking upright in the guise of a friend. He claimed kinship with all sorts of trades and talents, a jack-of-all-trades, as they say, though I suspect he was a master of none, unless you count the art of exaggeration, which he practiced with the fervor of a revival preacher. Why, he once informed me, with a straight face I might add (though his eyes did twinkle mischievously, mind you), that he single-handedly rescued a steamboat from a rogue sandbar using only a length of rope and his own considerable wit. The details, as he relayed them, grew more fantastical with each telling, involving a crew of bewildered pigs and a chorus of croaking frogs, naturally. 

And yet, despite this penchant for stretching the truth like a well-worn rubber band, there was something undeniably likeable about Harris. He possessed a boundless enthusiasm, a spirit that could light up a room like a well-oiled kerosene lamp. He was the sort who could find humor in the most dire of circumstances, who could spin a tale from the dullest of days. He was also, I suspect, deeply impractical. The man couldn't mend a leaky faucet to save his life, and his attempts at carpentry usually resulted in more splinters than furniture. Still, he'd approach each task with a renewed sense of confidence, a conviction that this time, by thunder, he'd get it right. And even when the whole endeavor crumbled around him, he'd simply dust himself off, grin, and declare that it was a “learning experience.” Heaven help us all if we learned as much from our failures as Harris claimed to, for we'd all be as knowledgeable as a library with no books, shelves full of nothing but empty promises and grand pronouncements. He was, in short, a glorious mess, a human tornado of good intentions and spectacularly flawed execution.
