Slade, now there was a character, a whole menagerie squeezed into one skin, and none of it particularly tame. I reckon you could bottle lightning and it'd be less volatile. We stumbled upon his station, some desolate wood affair clinging to the edge of damnation, whilst traversing the Territories, looking for gold but mostly finding hardtack and disillusionment. Slade held court there, a king without a crown, or maybe a king with a crown of dried blood, considering the stories that drifted around him like flies to a festering wound. He was division agent for Wells, Fargo & Co., a title grand enough to impress the greenhorns, but in truth, it meant he was the man you sent when you wanted something done that wouldn't smell too good under the nose of polite society.

He was a study in contrasts, that Slade. On one hand, he could charm the birds from the trees with a honeyed tongue, and on the other, he could stare a grizzly bear into submission with eyes as cold as a January wind. He'd quote Shakespeare one minute, then curse like a mule skinner the next. He kept order, of a sort, in that lawless patch of the world, though his methods were, let's just say, unconventional. More akin to a surgeon using a meat cleaver than a scalpel, if you catch my drift. There were tales, whispered in hushed tones around campfires, of men who crossed him and ended up decorating the landscape, permanently. Tales I neither confirm nor deny, mind you, but I wouldn't wager my last dollar against 'em being true. He had a reputation that preceded him like a thunderclap, and most folks were content to give him a wide berth. Which, I suppose, was exactly the point. It was a rough way to make a living, keeping the peace with a six-shooter and a hangman's grin, but in that corner of the world, it was hard to argue it wasn’t effective. Whether it was right? Well, that's a question for theologians and philosophers, and I was just a simple prospector, lookin' for my fortune and trying to avoid the fate of those poor souls who learned Slade's lessons the hard way.
