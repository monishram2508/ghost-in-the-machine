Well, I reckon I spent a spell in Salt Lake City, a place that's drier than a parched preacher’s throat after a long sermon on a hot Sunday. It's inhabited by Mormons, a curious bunch, they are. Seem like decent folk, mostly, if a bit… devoted. Their prophet, Joseph Smith, found some golden plates, buried somewhere near Palmyra, New York, I believe. Angels dictated to him, or so the story goes. Now, I’ve seen some peculiar things in my time, more peculiar than a mule wearing spectacles, but angel-dictated scripture does take the biscuit. But, I suppose, every man's got a right to his own peculiar belief system, so long as it doesn't involve pilfering my gold dust or trying to convince me the earth is flat.

These Mormons, they built themselves a grand city out in the desert, like a mirage shimmering with industry and hard work. Brigham Young, now there was a fellow with gumption! Led them across the plains, dodging Indians and locusts, built canals where before there was naught but scrub and dust. He believed in hard work, which, truth be told, ain’t a bad philosophy. They had this here practice of plural marriage for a spell, or polygamy as some city folk call it. Raised a fair amount of eyebrows, naturally, though I never could see what business it was of mine what a man did in the privacy of his own home so long as he wasn't hurting anybody. Though, managing all those wives must've been like herding cats. Some said the womenfolk were fiercely loyal, some said they were constantly scheming to be the favorite. I ain’t one to pry into marital affairs, I've learned. I will say, the women sure did know how to bake a proper loaf of bread and quilt a fine blanket. So, all things considered, the Mormons are a curious and hard-working bunch. They stick to themselves mostly, but they can sure make a desert bloom.
