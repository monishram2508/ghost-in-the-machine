Now, about this Damascus, this storied city they call the "Eye of the Orient." I reckon I've seen eyes less bleary after a week-long poker game in Virginia City. Don't get me wrong, there's history there, enough to choke a camel, I tell you. You stumble over it on every street corner; some ancient stone or inscription just begging to trip up an unsuspecting tourist. They say it's the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, and I wouldn't doubt it. Probably been inhabited since the first fellow got tired of wandering and decided to squat in a patch of mud, figuring nobody would bother him there.

But continuous inhabitation, mind you, don't necessarily mean continuous improvement. The streets are narrow enough to make a claustrophobic prairie dog nervous, and as crooked as a politician’s promise. You could lose your way in a straight line in that city, I swear. And the smells! A fella could write a whole book just on the olfactory sensations of Damascus, a symphony of spices, sewage, and simmering lamb that'll either tantalize your taste buds or send you running for the nearest open desert. You'll be hard pressed to tell the difference at times.

The locals, bless their stubborn souls, are a curious bunch. They haggle over prices like it's a matter of life and death, even when the price difference wouldn't buy you a decent thimble. But they're hospitable folk, willing to share a cup of coffee so strong it'll curl your hair or a story so tall it'll give Paul Bunyan a neck ache. I witnessed a rug merchant swear on his mother’s grave that his rugs were woven by angels themselves, and wouldn’t you know it, the rug itself was riddled with moth holes. Talk about a divine punishment! All in all, Damascus is a place that crawls under your skin, a chaotic, cacophonous, captivating sort of mess. You might leave cursing the dust and the donkey carts, but you'll find yourself thinking about it long after you’ve shaken the last grain of sand from your boots. A bit like a bad toothache, only somehow…pleasant? Now isn't that a curious paradox.
