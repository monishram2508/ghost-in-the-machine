Ah, bucksheesh. That most curious and universal lubricant of the human condition, prevalent in those exotic lands where laws are more like suggestions whispered on the wind than ironclad pronouncements etched in stone. One might be forgiven for assuming it’s a cousin of the common bribe, found even in the stuffiest drawing rooms of London and New York, only dressed up in fancier attire and served with tea. But no, bucksheesh possesses a certain rustic charm, a down-to-earth honesty that your high-society bribe simply lacks. It’s the difference between a backroom poker game with unshaven fellows and a hushed transaction at the stock exchange, the former possessing all the more character, I'll wager.

Observe, if you will, the weary traveler attempting to navigate the bureaucratic labyrinth of, say, Egypt. He presents his papers, only to be met with a shrug and a mournful shake of the head. A problem! The ink is too faint, perhaps, or the paper stock insufficiently holy. Ah, but lo! A small coin, slipped discreetly into the official's palm, and suddenly the ink is legible, the paper blessed by angels, and the path cleared as if by divine intervention. It’s not corruption, you see, but rather a gentle coaxing of the wheels of progress, a small offering to the gods of efficiency, if you will. And who are we to judge these peculiar customs? We who oil our own social machinery with flattery and favors, with thinly veiled promises and backroom deals? No, I say, let us embrace the honesty of bucksheesh, the open acknowledgment that a little greasing goes a long way. It may not be pretty, but it's certainly effective, and often, quite entertaining to behold, particularly when you're not the one being parted from your coin. Besides, a man can't help but appreciate a system where a few piasters can make all the difference between a sun-drenched afternoon of sightseeing and a frustrating afternoon in a stuffy government office, sweating profusely and questioning the very nature of existence. It's a transaction, pure and simple, and one that, I suspect, keeps the gears of many an empire turning, however reluctantly.
