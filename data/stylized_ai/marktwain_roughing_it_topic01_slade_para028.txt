Slade, now there was a town fit to make a saint swear. Or, more likely, trade his halo for a hand of poker. Situated, as it were, out in the howling wilderness of Nevada, it boasted not a single redeeming quality, save for a surfeit of tumbleweeds and a population thick with the sort of fellas who’d sooner shoot you for looking at them cross-eyed than offer you a cup of coffee. Coffee, mind you, that’d likely be strong enough to melt your dentures. I recollect arriving there one sweltering afternoon, dust coating me thicker than a layer of varnish, and finding the main street deserted save for a mangy dog gnawing on what I hoped was a discarded boot. The buildings were all of a piece - ramshackle, leaning at impossible angles, and looking as though a stiff breeze might send them tumbling into the next county. The saloons, of which there were an ungodly number for a town of its size, emitted a cacophony of raucous laughter, off-key piano playing, and the occasional muffled thud that suggested a disagreement was being settled with more enthusiasm than decorum. I ventured into one, the “Grizzly Gulch,” and was greeted by a scene so picturesque it almost made me forget the dust. A bar fight was in full swing, involving a collection of miners, cowboys, and what appeared to be a traveling salesman dressed in a decidedly worse-for-wear frock coat. The bartender, a burly fellow with a handlebar mustache that could’ve lassoed a steer, merely polished glasses and occasionally offered a word of encouragement to the combatants. All in all, Slade was a town where a fella could find adventure, trouble, and maybe, just maybe, lose all his hard-earned money in a game of chance. And frankly, after a few days, I was ready to take my chances elsewhere. The only thing I missed was the dog, he had a certain down-to-earth charm you simply couldn't find in the human inhabitants.
