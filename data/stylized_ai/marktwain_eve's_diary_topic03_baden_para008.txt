Baden-Baden, they call it, this so-called “Paradise” where the wealthy gather like moths to a particularly well-lit chandelier. Paradise, I say! Paradise, where the music sounds suspiciously like dying cats being strangled in perfect time to a waltz, and where the air is so thick with perfume and pomposity, a body could choke on it, I swear. I went, naturally, being dragged along by Adam, who developed a sudden and inexplicable fondness for “taking the waters,” which I suspect is his way of saying he wished to ogle the ladies, who, bless their painted little faces, are adorned with more jewels than the entire treasury of the Pharaohs. They parade about, these painted butterflies, trailing clouds of scent and batting their eyelashes like demented windmills. And the men! Heavens to Betsy, the men! They strut and posture, puffing out their chests like overripe pigeons, all competing for the attention of these bejeweled wonders. One fellow, a Baron something-or-other, nearly tripped over his own monocle trying to make a bow low enough to impress a Countess who, quite frankly, looked as though she'd swallowed a lemon whole. The casino, of course, is where the real tragedy unfolds. People gambling away fortunes, clinging to hope like a drowning man to a splinter. I saw one man, a respectable-looking sort, lose his shirt, his watch, and probably his wife's inheritance, all in the span of an hour. He left looking as pale as a ghost and muttering something about “bad luck” - as if a deity was personally conspiring against his wallet. It is, in short, a spectacle, Baden-Baden, a place where absurdity and extravagance dance a merry jig, and where even a well-meaning woman such as myself finds it difficult to tell where the genuine joy ends and the rank foolishness begins. One leaves the place lighter in pocket, and heavier of heart. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll take a long walk in the garden – far, far away from any music, perfume, or Barons.
