 Pard, now there's a breed and a half, if you ask me, though I'm not offering it up for free, mind you. You stumble across them mostly out West, draped over saloon banisters like over-ripe grapes, or strutting along dusty streets with a swagger that'd shame a peacock. They’re all slicked-back hair, flamboyant waistcoats, and enough gold chain to moor a small schooner. Likely as not, they inherited a mine, or maybe just inherited the ability to separate fools from their money at a poker table. It's a talent, a fine one, though I'd prefer to earn my bread through honest labor...or at least something that resembles honest labor.

 Now, a pard's always got a story, and nine times out of ten, it's a tall tale spun finer than a spider's silk. He'll tell you he once wrestled a grizzly bear for a silver dollar, or that he single-handedly saved a stagecoach from a band of Apaches, armed with nothing but a harmonica and a witty insult. Don't believe a word of it. Just nod along, buy him a drink, and enjoy the show. It's cheaper than going to the opera, and twice as entertaining. 

 The peculiar thing about a pard is his utter confidence. He could be dead broke, owing money to every bartender from here to the Mississippi, and still, he'll act like he owns the whole darn town. It's a magnificent con, really, and sometimes you almost admire it. Almost. But keep a tight grip on your wallet, friend. That air of easy affluence is usually just a cleverly disguised attempt to ease you of yours. They're like magpies drawn to shiny objects, only the shiny object they desire is your hard-earned cash. You might call them charming, roguish even, but I call them "pard," short for "partially responsible for my dwindling bank account." They're a necessary evil, I suppose, like mosquitoes in the summertime. You complain about them, you swat them away, but you know darn well they'll be back tomorrow, buzzing in your ear and looking for a piece of the pie.
