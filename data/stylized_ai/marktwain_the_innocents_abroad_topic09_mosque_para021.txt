Now, concerning these mosques, which folks seem to be so all-fired curious about, they’re not, as some might suspect, just oversized hatboxes for devout heads. No sir, they’re a sight more intriguing than that, though admittingly, sometimes just as perplexing. You’ll find ’em dotted all over the globe, grand affairs in Istanbul with minarets sticking up like righteous fingers pointing accusingly at the heavens, or humble adobe structures baking in the sun out in some forgotten corner of the Sahara. But the purpose, you see, is the same: a place for a chap to get down on his knees and have a chinwag with the Almighty, or at least contemplate his own navel while surrounded by a goodly amount of stained glass and fancy calligraphy.

The interiors, well, they're generally free of the sort of clutter and gewgaws that Catholics seem so fond of. No pews, mind you, just carpets stretching out like a floral ocean. And all those darned shoes piled up by the door! It's enough to give a sanitation officer the vapors, though I suppose it's no different than leaving muddy boots on the porch back home. And the architecture, bless its heart, it can be a real marvel. Arches that seem to defy gravity, domes that whisper secrets, and light filtering through intricate screens – it's enough to make a feller think he's stepped right into a fairy tale, or at least a particularly well-illustrated book on Arabian Nights. But despite all the finery, the real draw is the feeling, that sense of quiet contemplation that settles over you like a warm blanket on a chilly evening. Whether you believe in the particulars of their dogma or not, there’s no denying that these mosques, in their own peculiar way, offer a bit of respite from the hullabaloo of the world, a moment to catch your breath and maybe, just maybe, figure out what in tarnation you're doing here anyway.
