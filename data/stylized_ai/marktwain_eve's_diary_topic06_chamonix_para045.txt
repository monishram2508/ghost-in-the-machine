Chamonix, you see, is not merely a village perched precariously upon the skirt of Mont Blanc, no sirree. It is, instead, a most picturesque, and some might even venture to say, theatrical stage setting. A stage designed, I suspect, by some mischievous imp with a penchant for the grandiose and a pocket overflowing with snow. One arrives expecting, perhaps, the rustic charm of some humble alpine hamlet. What one finds, instead, is a place where the glaciers themselves seem to be showing off, glistening like diamonds on a dowager's aging fingers. The hotels, good heavens, are stuffed with Englishmen trying desperately to look as though they spend their days conquering peaks rather than conquering roast beef. The ladies, bless their embroidered souls, flutter about like so many brilliantly colored butterflies, their parasols protecting complexions that have clearly never seen a véritable alpine sun. 

And the mountains, oh, the mountains! They loom, they glare, they positively *judge* you from their icy heights. I felt, I confess, rather like a beetle attempting to scale the side of a particularly frosty wedding cake. There's the Aiguille du Midi, a needle of rock so sharp it could pierce the very heavens, accessible, if you can stomach it, by a contraption that flings you upwards with the reckless abandon of a lovesick poet. The views, naturally, are breathtaking, quite capable of rendering one speechless, which, as you may well imagine, is a state I rarely achieve. I did witness a rather portly gentleman nearly faint upon beholding the void; a spectacle that, while regrettable, did provide a certain level of amusement, I confess. And the price of it all? Suffice it to say, it's enough to make your wallet weep bitter tears. But as the French so elegantly put it, "c'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre!" or, as I'd translate, it's grand, but I think I'll take my tea down at the village.
