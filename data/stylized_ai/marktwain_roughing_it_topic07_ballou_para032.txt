Ballou, you see, was a specimen – a tenderfoot so green he practically photosynthesized sunshine. Fresh from the East, he was, with more notions crammed into his head than a badger has fleas, none of which, I might add, bore the slightest resemblance to the realities of the silver mines or the social peculiarities of Nevada. He arrived, did Ballou, sporting a coat that looked like it’d swallowed a whole rainbow and boots so polished they could blind a prairie dog at fifty paces. He was, in short, dressed for a grand soiree in Paris, and not a day’s work at the Comstock Lode. Now, Ballou, bless his naive heart, fancied himself a miner, dreaming of nuggets the size of pumpkins and veins of silver that stretched further than a Mormon’s wedding vows. He took to it like a duck to a drought, I tell you. 

His first attempt at swinging a pick resulted in him hitting his own foot, and his cry of agony echoed further than any dynamite blast I ever heard. Later, trying to pan for gold, he managed to find a button, three rusty nails, and a particularly unappetizing toad. He looked at me with that hopeful gleam in his eye, expecting praise for his prodigious find. "Treasure, Mr. Twain!" he exclaims, presenting his damp, muddy palm. "Treasure indeed, Ballou," I replies, "but not the kind you can exchange for whiskey." He never quite caught on to the local customs, either. Attempted to pay for a drink with a twenty-dollar gold piece in a saloon notorious for its 'creative' arithmetic. Nearly caused a riot, that did. The barman, a burly chap with a mustache like a walrus, looked ready to use Ballou’s head to polish the counter. Took some fast talking to save Ballou from becoming a permanent fixture in the floorboards. Yes sir, Ballou was an experience all right, a walking, talking comedy of errors in a world that wasn't inclined to laughter.
