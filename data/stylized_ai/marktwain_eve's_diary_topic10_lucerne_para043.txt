Lucerne, bless its heart, is a town that sits there like a well-fed burgher content with his lot, preening itself in the reflection of its own lake. It’s a pretty enough town, mind you, all gabled roofs and painted facades, like a gingerbread village left out a bit too long in the sun. The Lake, of course, is the star of the show, all shimmering and coy, pretending to be a mirror for the mountains but mostly just showing off its own bottomless depths. You can take a paddle-steamer across it, naturally, which is just about the most civilized way I can think of to waste an afternoon, unless you’re fond of arguing with a German professor about the proper declension of the word "Schiff." I tell you, they take their nouns seriously over there, like guarding the gold at Fort Knox. The Chapel Bridge, now, that’s a curiosity. Covered in paintings, they are, depicting scenes from Lucerne’s storied past. Trouble is, half of them are so faded and water-stained you can’t tell if you’re looking at a battle or a particularly vigorous cheese fondue. And those poor souls who painted them likely never expected they'd be stared at by hordes of tourists snapping photographs with contraptions that could capture a cloud’s shadow from a mile away. Imagine their shock! And the Lion Monument, carved right into a rock face, poor creature. They say it commemorates the Swiss Guards who died defending the Tuileries Palace during the French Revolution. A noble cause, no doubt, but frankly, the lion looks like it's got a terrible toothache and is about to bite somebody. Tourists gather 'round it, whispering solemn pronouncements about bravery and sacrifice, but I suspect the lion just wishes they'd all go away and let him get some peace. It's all grand and impressive, this Lucerne, but sometimes I suspect it takes itself a bit too seriously. It needs a good poke with a stick, a well-aimed snowball, or maybe just a rogue yodeler to remind it that life ain't always about being picturesque.
