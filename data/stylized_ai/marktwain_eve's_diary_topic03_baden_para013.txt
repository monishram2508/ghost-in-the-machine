Baden, ah, Baden! A place where the very air seems perfumed with the scent of money and the faint aroma of, well, medicinal waters, if you must know. They say these waters possess the power to cure all manner of ailments, but I suspect the only ailment truly cured in Baden is that distressing lack of funds, replaced by a temporary abundance extracted from the pockets of credulous tourists. The place itself is a charming little dollhouse of a town, all gingerbread architecture and manicured gardens, as if someone had decided to build a city entirely out of sugar plums and then proceeded to polish it incessantly.

One encounters a peculiar species of humanity there, a peculiar breed indeed. The men, uniformly distinguished by their paunches and their elaborate mustaches, promenade along the Lichtentaler Allee with an air of profound importance, as though the weight of the world—or at least, the weight of their fortunes—rested squarely upon their shoulders. They converse gravely about stocks and bonds, or perhaps the latest scandal involving the royal family, but one cannot help but suspect that their true concern lies solely with the proper angle of their walking sticks. As for the ladies, they flutter about in their silks and their jewels, like brilliantly colored butterflies trapped within a gilded cage. They engage in polite, yet merciless, social maneuvering, plotting the downfall of rivals over cups of lukewarm coffee and pastries that taste suspiciously like sawdust. Their smiles are dazzling, but they have a certain predatory glint about them, as if they were sizing up potential investments rather than simply exchanging pleasantries. Of course, I myself indulged in a bit of promenading and flutterment during my time there, under the guise of scientific observation of course, and it must be said, the pastries were not all sawdust, some were rather delightful. All in all, Baden is an artificial paradise, a delightful absurdity, where one can briefly suspend disbelief and imagine that life is nothing more than a pleasant round of gambling, gossip, and dubious health treatments, until the bills arrive.
