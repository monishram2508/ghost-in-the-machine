The Neckar, bless its heart, is not precisely the Mississippi. One wouldn’t claim it’s vying for the title of ‘Father of Waters’ anytime soon, unless one had imbibed rather liberally from a local vineyard, which, I’ll confess, I have done on occasion. It’s a comely little stream, mind you, winding its way through hills green enough to make a leprechaun homesick, and past towns so quaint they practically apologize for existing in the twentieth century. Indeed, it’s so narrow in places, you could, with a decent running start and a prayer to Saint Christopher, likely hop across without getting your stockings damp. Though I wouldn’t advise it, particularly after that liberal vineyard visit I mentioned.

It’s dotted with castles, naturally. Europe seems to have an affliction for castles, like a child with the measles, only instead of spots, it’s fortified stone and tales of chivalry. And the Neckar dutifully reflects them in its placid surface, as if to say, "Yes, I’ve seen it all before. Knights, sieges, star-crossed lovers. Been there, rippled that.” You'll find those ponderous German fellows, the students with their peculiar caps, punting along in boats that appear perpetually on the verge of capsizing. They sing these mournful songs about unrequited love and the fleeting nature of existence, or perhaps they're just homesick for their sausages. Hard to tell, really. And then there are the tourists, armed with cameras the size of small artillery, snapping photos of everything that doesn't move, and some things that do, like the aforementioned capsizing punts. They seem to believe they’re capturing the very essence of Heidelberg, or Tübingen, or whatever charming hamlet they’ve wandered into, when, in truth, they’re merely accumulating a pile of rectangular memories that will eventually be relegated to the back of a drawer, right next to Aunt Hilda’s doilies. The Neckar, meanwhile, just keeps flowing, carrying its secrets and its flotsam and jetsam downstream, oblivious to the hubbub, a silent, slightly bemused observer of the human comedy unfolding on its banks. A patient, unassuming river; not grand, perhaps, but agreeable enough company for an afternoon stroll, particularly if one has a flask filled with that local vineyard’s finest tucked away in one’s pocket.
