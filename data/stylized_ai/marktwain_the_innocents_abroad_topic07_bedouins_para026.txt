Now, consider the Bedouin, that son of the desert sands, a creature as sun-baked and leathery as a forgotten date in the Sultan’s pantry. One finds him, or rather, he finds *you*, usually perched atop a swaybacked camel that looks as though it's personally swallowed the last remnants of the Nile’s flood. A fellow of profound patience, mind you. Patience that would make even the most stoic sphinx blush with envy. He’ll offer you a cup of that devilish, bitter coffee that tastes remarkably like chewing on burnt bicycle tires, all the while eyeing your purse with a look that manages to be simultaneously charming and utterly calculating. He’ll regale you with tales of ancient kings and shimmering mirages, tales spun finer than the threads of his own worn tent, and just as likely to vanish with the next desert breeze.

They say they're descended from nobility, these Bedouin fellows, direct kin to kings and prophets. Well, I wouldn't wager my best Stetson on that claim, seeing as every rascal in this part of the world claims some royal lineage or other. Still, there's a certain dignity about them, a kind of quiet defiance in the face of the relentless sun and the unforgiving landscape. They wander the desert as if they own it, which, come to think of it, they probably do, considering nobody else in their right mind would want it. They are masters of survival in a land where even a lizard has to think twice before sticking its head out of the sand. They know the stars like a sailor knows his ropes, and can find water where you and I would only see endless dunes and a grim prospect of parched throat. So, while their hands may be a little sticky and their stories a tad embellished, one can't help but admire their tenacity, their resilience, and their frankly astonishing ability to make a profit off gullible tourists who’ve ventured too far from the Nile’s comforts. And heaven knows, a bit of admiration, and perhaps a healthy dose of skepticism, is just what one needs when encountering the Bedouin in his natural habitat.
