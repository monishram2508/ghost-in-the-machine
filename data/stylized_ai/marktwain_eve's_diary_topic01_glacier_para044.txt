Now, this glacier business, it’s something to behold, if you’ve a mind for slow, ponderous spectacles. Eve once asked me, in that wide-eyed way of hers, "Adam, is it truly water, frozen hard as a rock, yet flowing, oh, ever so slowly?" And I had to confess, the thing confounds even my logical mind. It’s like watching a mountain decide to take a stroll, only the stroll takes a thousand years, give or take a century or two. We saw one up north, a hulking beast of ice the size of… well, the size of the whole confounded Garden, practically. The blue in it, mind you, is something no painter could ever capture, though Lord knows they'd try, bless their hearts. They'd be chasing after a rainbow, that’s what they’d be doing, for the color shifts and dances with the light like a mischievous spirit.

And the noises it makes! Groaning and creaking like an old man trying to get out of bed, or cracking like a stubborn walnut under a rock. It reminds me of how Eve sounds after she spent the whole day chasing butterflies, except a thousand times louder and more… glacial, if you’ll forgive the pun. It does carve its way through the land, too, like a sculptor with an infinity to work with. Leaves behind all sorts of mess. Boulders scattered about like pebbles on a beach, valleys carved deep enough to swallow a whole flock of sheep, and mud, oh the mud! Enough to mire a mammoth if it weren’t careful. It’s truly a sight, this glacier. A slow-motion catastrophe, a testament to the power of patience, and a constant reminder that even the most solid-seeming things are in a state of perpetual, albeit glacial, change. Though whether that change will amount to anything good for us, or merely more mud, well, that's a question best left for another day, and perhaps another lifetime.
