Genoa, now there's a city that’ll try your patience, I tell you. A regular warren of alleys, twisted and turned like the schemes of a Medici banker. You’d think a fellow with a nose for adventure, such as myself, would be right at home. But no, these were alleys designed to confound a mule, let alone a man armed with only a Baedeker and a smattering of Italian picked up in a dodgy steamer saloon. And the smells! A symphony of the sea, fried fish, and something indescribably… ancient. One half expects to stumble upon a forgotten Roman forum in some dark corner, guarded by a grumpy cat and the lingering aroma of yesterday's garlic.

The architecture, mind you, is grand enough, if you can manage to crane your neck up past the washing hanging overhead like so many flags of surrender. Palazzos of marble, hinting at fortunes made and lost on the turn of a ducat or the whim of the wind. But try to actually *get* to these grand edifices! You'll be squeezed between fruit vendors hawking suspiciously bright oranges and sailors with a vocabulary that would make a parrot blush. And the Genoese themselves! Taciturn fellows, generally, though their hands tell a tale of ceaseless gesticulation and passionate debate. Trying to get a straight answer out of one is like trying to nail jelly to a wall – slippery, frustrating, and ultimately, likely to end in a sticky mess. But despite all this, there’s a certain charm, a rugged, almost defiant beauty to the place. It’s a city that doesn’t care much for tourists, I suspect, and that, perhaps, is its greatest virtue. For in its grit and grime, in its cacophony and confusion, lies a genuine, unfiltered piece of Italy, far more compelling than any postcard-perfect panorama you might find elsewhere. It’s a city that repels and attracts in equal measure, leaving a fellow wondering if he's been blessed or cursed to have stumbled upon it at all.
