We paddled up to the thing in our little boat, a contraption Captain Sam swore was seaworthy, though I suspected it was held together more by hope and stubborn cussing than actual nails. The glacier, bless its frozen heart, was a sight to behold, a monumental cake made of ice, left out in the sun by some forgetful giant baker. Layers upon layers it had, like rings on a very, very old tree, only instead of telling tales of droughts and abundance, these told tales of snow and more snow, piled high until it decided gravity was a good idea. The color of it was peculiar, too, not just white, oh no, nothing so simple. Parts were a milky blue, like the sky had fallen in and frozen solid, while other bits were streaked with dirt and gravel, the poor thing looking like it had taken a tumble down a coal chute.

And the noise! Well, imagine the sound of a thousand drunken carpenters, all hammering and sawing at once, only instead of wood, they’re working on ice, and instead of sobriety, they’re fueled by… well, more ice, I reckon. Cracks and groans and pops echoed across the water, and every now and then a chunk the size of a small church would break off with a thunderous roar, plunging into the sea with a splash that nearly swamped our ridiculous little boat. Captain Sam, of course, thought this was hilarious. I, on the other hand, was calculating the distance to shore and wondering if my bustle would float. He kept muttering something about calving, which I assumed was some nautical term for ice giving birth, though I couldn't rightly see where it got the time, being so busy standing perfectly still. It was a grand, if somewhat alarming, spectacle, and I daresay if I hadn’t been so worried about getting a cold and having my best hat ruined, I might have actually enjoyed it. As it was, I mostly enjoyed the thought of getting back to the cabin and a good cup of tea, preferably without icebergs in it.
