Now, concerning this sepulchre business, it's a right queer affair, ain't it? You see these grand edifices scattered about, all fancy carvings and pious inscriptions, enough marble to pave the entire state of Missouri. And what's inside? Why, a fellow pushing up daisies, same as the pauper buried in Potter's Field under a simple wooden marker. But oh, the difference in the send-off! One gets a brass band and a eulogy long enough to bore the angels, while the other gets a quick shove and a silent prayer, if that.

It strikes me as a mighty peculiar thing, this obsession with dressing up death. A man spends his life pinching pennies, dodging creditors, and getting rained on, and then, BAM! he's suddenly worth a king's ransom in stonework. Seems like a more sensible arrangement to spend that money on living, wouldn't you agree? Buy yourself a fine horse, a good bottle of whiskey, and a comfortable rocking chair, rather than anticipating needing such an elaborate box and tombstone later on.

I recall old man Hemlock, who built his own mausoleum twenty years before he kicked the bucket. Spent his every waking hour fussing over the details: Grecian columns, a stained-glass window depicting his own likeness shaking hands with Saint Peter (a sight I suspect even Saint Peter would have found dubious), and an inscription in Latin that nobody could decipher. Hemlock lived in a shack barely fit for a stray dog, mind you, ate beans three times a day, and wore patches upon patches on his Sunday suit. Died of pneumonia, caught, ironically enough, while admiring his mausoleum in a rainstorm. Now there’s irony, served up with a healthy dose of poetic justice. The whole affair just goes to show, friend, that sometimes the finest sepulchre simply can't protect you from a good honest chill and the ultimate grand equalizer. And all those fancy trappings? Likely just a comfort for the living, trying to convince themselves they’ve somehow outsmarted the inevitable.
