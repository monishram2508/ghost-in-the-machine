Lucerne, ah, that little nest of a town nestled on the edge of its lake, like a robin’s egg in a verdant cup. I found it charming, I confess, though charm, as we all know, is often but a thin veneer over something rather less delectable, like a widow’s practiced smile after her fourth husband has conveniently cashed out. The lake itself, they call it Vierwaldstättersee – a name that rolls off the tongue with the grace of a runaway hay wagon – is a spectacle, mind you. Girt by mountains that look like giants who’ve sat down for a bit of a snooze, their heads still in the clouds, presumably pondering matters of cosmic importance while down below, tourists like yours truly squabble over the best angles for a photograph. They say William Tell, that legendary chap with the apple and the crossbow, did his rebellious deeds somewhere in these parts. Fact or fancy, it matters not, for the Swiss are a people who’ve mastered the art of profiting handsomely from both. They'll sell you a souvenir arrow, a William Tell cuckoo clock, and a fondue set all in the same breath.

The Chapel Bridge, though, that’s a sight to behold, even if it leans a bit like a tipsy uncle after a Christmas feast. They say it’s ancient, and filled with paintings detailing the history of the place. I say it's a very long, covered bridge with some rather dodgy artwork inside, prone to catching fire every now and then. But bless their hearts, the Swiss rebuild it, always. It reminds you of those stubborn New England farmers, eternally patching up their stone walls after yet another winter. Gives one a warm, fuzzy feeling, unless you're the chap footing the bill, of course. As for the Lion Monument, that mournful beast carved into the cliff face, well, it's a masterpiece of melancholy. It's meant to commemorate the Swiss Guards who perished during the French Revolution. And while it does tug at the heartstrings a tad, I couldn’t help but wonder how many francs they charged to have one's name etched on the plaque, thus guaranteeing everlasting glory, or at least a good laugh for future generations. All in all, Lucerne’s a place you can’t help but smile at, even if the smile is tinged with the awareness that you're being gently, skillfully, and undeniably fleeced. A bit like falling in love, when you come to think of it.
