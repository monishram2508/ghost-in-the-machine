Zermatt, bless its heart, is a village clinging to the skirts of the Matterhorn like a lovesick swain to his betrothed, only the Matterhorn, I suspect, is considerably less receptive. The air, they say, is crisp and clean, though one can't help but wonder if that's merely because the stench of horse manure, the primary mode of transportation besides shank's mare, has temporarily deserted the nostrils. Electrically-powered buggies whiz about like demented bumblebees, a peculiar concession to progress in a place otherwise steeped in quaintness. The hotels stand tall, some resembling gingerbread castles, others more akin to monstrous wedding cakes, all vying for the best view of that darned Matterhorn. It's a grand sight, mind you, that mountain, all jagged and arrogant against the blue, but one begins to suspect it's developed a rather swelled head from all the attention. Imagine, if you will, being stared at adoringly from dawn 'til dusk, every day of the year. Even I, with my considerable charm, would likely become insufferable.

The tourists, of course, are a sight to behold. They arrive laden with more equipment than a polar expedition, swathed in layers of brightly colored fabrics, each one convinced they are about to conquer the slopes. They teeter precariously on cobblestone streets, clutching maps that appear to be in a language decipherable only by goats. They come for the skiing, of course, but also for the cheese fondue, which they consume with a fervor that suggests they haven't eaten in weeks. And the prices! One would think they were selling gold-dust-flavored cheese and diamond-studded bread to justify such exorbitant rates. Still, they pay it willingly, because, you see, they've come to Zermatt to escape their own humdrum realities, and who am I to begrudge them a little folly? Let them have their overpriced fondue and their picture-perfect view. After all, even the most jaded traveler can't help but feel a little spark of wonder in a place where the mountains truly do touch the sky, even if that sky is just a backdrop for an elaborate charade.
