Now, a sepulchre, you understand, ain't just your common, garden-variety grave. Oh no, friend, it's got pretensions. It's like a tomb, only louder, a declaration in stone that the feller inside wasn't just passing through, but rather, a person of consequence. Or, at least, someone who *wished* to appear that way. You'll find 'em scattered around the old countries, mostly, looking for all the world like miniature, overly ambitious houses built for folks who’ve lost all interest in interior decorating. Marble, mostly, carved up something fierce, with cherubs and weeping women, inscriptions long enough to bore a stone angel, and maybe even a bronze door that squeaks something awful when the wind gets frisky.

You'll notice, often as not, they're situated in spots where nobody wants to be. Remote hilltops where the sheep have the good sense to avoid the brambles, overgrown churchyards where the headstones lean like drunken gamblers, these are the sepulchre's natural habitat. And why's that, you ask? Well, I reckon it's because nobody much wants to be reminded of their own mortality, especially when it’s presented with such pomp and circumstance. It's like trying to enjoy a picnic while a fella plays a mournful tune on the bagpipes; depressing, and likely to attract ants. The fella inside, though, he’s past carin’. He's got his eternal real estate secured, even if the only visitors he gets are pigeons lookin’ for a dry spot during a rain shower. And there the sepulchre stands, a monument to ambition, vanity, and the inescapable fact that, sooner or later, we're all gonna wind up takin' up residence in a place that ain't fit for livin’ but suited just fine for being dead. All that fancy stone and carving, just for a box of bones. Makes a body think, don't it? Makes a body think that maybe a simple, honest hole in the ground ain't such a bad bargain after all. Less fuss, less pretense, and the worms are just as happy either way.
