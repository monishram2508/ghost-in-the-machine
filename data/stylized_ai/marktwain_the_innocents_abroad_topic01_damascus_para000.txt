Now, Damascus, that venerable old city, why, she’s seen more history than a stray dog has fleas. You wouldn’t believe the tales those sun-baked walls could tell, if only they weren't so blasted dusty and stubbornly silent. I reckon Cleopatra probably batted her eyelashes at some smarmy Roman senator right around the corner from where you can now haggle for a slightly tarnished brass teapot. And speaking of haggling, a man better have his wits about him when venturing into the souk, I tell you. It’s a chaotic ballet of insistent merchants, bewildered tourists, and chickens who appear to know exactly where they’re going, which is more than I can say for myself half the time. 

They’ll try to sell you everything from carpets guaranteed to be spun from the beards of angels (I'm fairly certain angels don't have beards, but who am I to argue?) to spices that supposedly grant eternal youth, though I suspect they just grant a rather persistent case of indigestion. The air, mind you, is thick enough to spread on toast – a potent cocktail of incense, grilling meat, and something vaguely resembling camel. It’s enough to make a teetotaler reach for a bottle of arak. The architecture, bless its heart, is a glorious mishmash of every empire that ever decided to stop by for tea and conquer the place. You’ve got Roman columns cheek-by-jowl with Ottoman minarets, and little Byzantine flourishes peeking out from behind everything like shy children. It's a bit like a well-worn quilt, patched together with the dreams and ambitions of a thousand different dreamers and ambitious fellows, some good, some likely not. And the people! Ah, the Damascenes! They'll offer you tea and argue with you about politics in the same breath, and you won’t know whether to thank them or call the authorities. But mark my words, you'll never be bored. Damascus, you see, she’s a city that grabs you by the scruff of the neck and refuses to let go, even if you beg her to.
