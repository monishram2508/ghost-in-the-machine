Well, I spent a spell out in Utah, amongst the Mormons, a peculiar people if ever there were. Now, I ain’t one to judge a man by his beliefs, not unless they involve takin’ my poke of gold, mind you. But these Mormons, they got a system all their own. Polygamy, they called it – a man hitched to more wives than a Mississippi steamboat has paddles. Said it was divinely ordained, a command straight from the angel Moroni hisself, or some such sky-pilot. Seemed a mite inconvenient to me, havin’ to remember all those birthdays and anniversaries. Imagine the cost of combs alone!

Brigham Young, that fella, he was the head honcho. A fellow with a face like a weather-beaten boulder and the persuasive tongue of a snake-oil salesman. He ruled that territory with an iron fist wrapped in a velvet glove. Folks said he had more wives than fingers and toes, and children scattered across the desert like tumbleweeds. Whether that was fact or folklore, I couldn’t rightly say, but it made for a good yarn around the campfire.

They were industrious souls, though, these Mormons. Turned that barren desert into a garden patch. Irrigated everything with a tenacity that'd make a thirsty camel jealous. Built their Salt Lake City with more brick and mortar than sense, some might say, but there it stood, a testament to their will and their…well, their peculiarities. They’d sing hymns with gusto, work from sunup to sundown, and pray with a fervor that could rattle the windows of a saloon. An odd mix, to be sure, but one that seemed to work for them, at least. Made a fella wonder if there weren't something to this "divine guidance" after all. Then again, I reckon a good strong work ethic and a knack for cooperation can move mountains, angel or no angel.
