Now, about this bucksheesh business, it's a right curious custom, wouldn't you agree? Why, it's more pervasive than dust in a Cairo bazaar, and sticks to you like a persistent fly on a summer's day. You can't escape it, not even if you tried to hide yourself in the deepest tomb, for I reckon some enterprising mummy-unwrapper would be poking his bandaged hand out, expecting a little something for his troubles. Bucksheesh, they call it, a word that sounds like a sneeze swallowed at the last minute, but signifies a universal language spoken fluently by beggars, bootblacks, donkey drivers, and even, whisper it softly, the fellows in uniforms with shiny buttons.

It's not quite a bribe, you see, though it shares a close kinship, like cousins who squabble over an inheritance. A bribe promises specific favors, a bucksheesh merely greases the wheels, makes things run a bit smoother, like a little oil applied to a rusty hinge. You might hand a small coin to the chap who "guides" you through a temple, even though you suspect he knows as much about hieroglyphics as your old aunt knows about playing the banjo. Or perhaps you offer a pittance to the fellow guarding some ancient statue, hoping he'll look the other way while you sneak a cheeky photograph, even though a hundred others are doing the same.

The beauty of bucksheesh, if there be any beauty in such a frankly mercenary pursuit, lies in its sheer democracy. Everyone's in on it, from the lowest street sweeper to, I daresay, the highest officials (though they, of course, would call it something far more elegant). And the amount? Ah, there's the riddle! Too little, and you risk insult; too much, and you're marked as a fool, ripe for plucking. It's a constant calculation, a dance between generosity and self-preservation, a game where the only prize is not being cheated more than absolutely necessary. One gets the distinct impression that without it, the entire apparatus of existence in these parts would simply grind to a halt, like a clockwork toy run down. It's a tax on being a foreigner, a surcharge on curiosity, and a testament to the human talent for finding new and inventive ways to part a man from his money.
