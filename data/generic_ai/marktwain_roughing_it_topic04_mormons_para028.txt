Mormons, formally known as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, constitute a religious and cultural group with unique origins and beliefs that set them apart from traditional Protestant denominations. Founded in the early 19th century by Joseph Smith in upstate New York, the church emerged from a period of intense religious revivalism. Smith claimed to have received visitations from God and Jesus Christ, followed by angelic visitations from the angel Moroni, who directed him to golden plates containing ancient writings. Smith translated these plates, resulting in the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible by adherents. This book recounts the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who received visits from Jesus Christ after his resurrection, solidifying the belief in a uniquely American religious heritage.

Central to Mormon theology is the belief in continuing revelation, meaning God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets. Church leaders are therefore considered modern-day prophets and apostles who guide the Church according to God's will. The church also emphasizes the importance of temple worship, which includes performing sacred ordinances such as baptisms for the dead and eternal marriage sealings, intended to unite families beyond mortality. These ordinances are performed in dedicated temples, considered houses of the Lord, and are reserved for members who adhere to strict moral guidelines, including abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, as well as adhering to a strict code of sexual purity.

Missionary service is another defining characteristic of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving voluntary two-year missions, spreading the church's message throughout the world. This missionary work contributes to the church's global reach and diverse membership. Beyond religious practices, Mormonism fosters a strong sense of community and social responsibility. Members are encouraged to be active participants in their local communities and to contribute to charitable causes. The church also provides a comprehensive social welfare program, assisting members in need with food, housing, and other essential resources. This emphasis on community and service, coupled with a distinct theological framework, has shaped the identity and cultural landscape of Mormons worldwide.
