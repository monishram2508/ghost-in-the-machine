Now, Galilee, that bit of the Holy Land what the preachers are always a-hollering about. I'd heard tell of it as a place overflowing with milk and honey, a veritable garden of Eden after a good spring rain. Reality, as she often does, had a different tale to spin. Milk, perhaps, if you were mighty friendly with the local goat herders and had a strong stomach for the stuff. Honey? Well, I reckon the bees kept most of it to themselves, seeing as how the land was more rocks and dust than blossoming meadows. Still, it had a certain charm, I suppose, like a homely mule with a stubborn streak – you couldn't help but feel a sort of begrudging affection for the place.

The Sea of Galilee, they call it a sea, mind you, but it's more of a respectable pond, really. Big enough to drown a fisherman or two, to be sure, but not exactly the kind of body of water to inspire epic seafaring tales. I took a boat ride on it, a rickety affair propelled by a fellow who looked like he'd been wrestling fish since the dawn of time. He kept regaling me with stories of miraculous catches and ghostly apparitions, but I was too busy trying not to fall overboard to pay him much mind. The water was a rather pleasant shade of blue, though, and the hills rolling down to the shore had a certain picturesque quality, even if they were mostly barren and sun-baked.

The towns scattered about were a curious mix of ancient stones and modern squalor. Tiberias, they say, was once a grand Roman city, now it’s a dusty place, where folks haggle over dates and trinkets with the tenacity of starving dogs fighting over a bone. Nazareth, where the whole shebang with Jesus kicked off, well, it wasn't much to write home about either. Plenty of churches, of course, each claiming to be built over the very spot where Gabriel popped the question to Mary. I half expected him to pop out again, frankly, probably charging admission for the privilege. All in all, Galilee was a place that promised more than it delivered, a landscape that teased the imagination but rarely satisfied it. But perhaps, I reflected, that was the whole point. Maybe it’s not the sights and sounds, but the empty spaces that allow a feller's mind to wander towards the Big Man upstairs. Or, maybe, it was just plain hot, and I needed a strong lemonade.
