Now, Galilee. They call it Galilee of the Gentiles, a name fit to curl a Hebrew's beard, seeing as how it's so chock-full of foreigners and their unseemly ways. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's overrun, mind you, but a fellow can hardly swing a dead cat without hitting some Greek trader bartering for olives or a Roman centurion looking for a lost legionnaire, likely drunk on that Galilean wine that tastes suspiciously like watered-down vinegar. The Sea of Galilee, or Lake Tiberias, or whatever fanciful name they’re calling it this week, is a fine stretch of water, I suppose, if you're fond of boats and fishermen, who seem to multiply faster than rabbits in a vineyard. The fish, they say, are abundant. I wouldn't know, never much cared for a fishy dinner myself, always thought they looked at you accusingly from the plate.

The land itself is pleasant enough, rolling hills covered in more wildflowers than a sensible man knows what to do with. One might almost call it picturesque, if it weren't for the dust and the beggars and the general air of "give me a shekel" that hangs about the place. Capernaum, they brag, was a thriving town. Well, thriving it may have been, but thriving like a weed patch in a neglected garden, full of life perhaps, but hardly a place for the discerning traveler. Nazareth, ah, Nazareth! They say a certain carpenter hailed from there. I can believe it. A place so small and unremarkable, a fellow would have to do something extraordinary just to be remembered. The only remarkable thing about it now is the sheer number of flies buzzing about, thick as thieves they are. Still, the air is clean, and a body can find a patch of shade under an olive tree, listen to the cicadas, and forget, for a moment, that the world is full of taxes and preachers. Not a bad way to pass an afternoon, I reckon, even in Galilee.
