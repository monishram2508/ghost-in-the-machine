The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian denomination that emerged in the United States during the 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith, the church posits a unique scripture alongside the Bible, most notably the Book of Mormon, which they believe recounts the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. This distinctive scriptural canon, alongside the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, shapes Mormon theology and practice. Core beliefs center on the importance of family, divine authority through priesthood leadership, and the concept of continuing revelation, meaning that God continues to communicate with humankind through prophets in modern times. Mormons traditionally practice a strict moral code, often emphasizing abstention from alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs, and promoting chastity before marriage and fidelity within marriage. They are known for their strong community ties and extensive humanitarian efforts, providing aid and support to those in need globally. Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young adults often dedicating one to two years to serving missions in various parts of the world, proselytizing and engaging in service projects. The church also places a heavy emphasis on temple worship, where members participate in sacred ordinances believed to connect them more closely with God and their ancestors. While some of their beliefs and practices differ significantly from mainstream Christian denominations, Mormons consider themselves to be followers of Jesus Christ, striving to live according to his teachings and preparing for his second coming. Over time, the church has evolved, adjusting some practices while maintaining core theological tenets, and has experienced substantial growth globally, becoming a significant religious force with millions of members worldwide.
