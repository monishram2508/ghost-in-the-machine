Slade, that alkali purgatory squatting betwixt the true goldfields and the shimmering mirage of Washoe. A town, mind you, that appeared to have been assembled by a committee of particularly untalented buzzards, each contributing only the most unpalatable scraps. The buildings, well, they were less structures and more like stubborn arguments with gravity, each leaning further into the next, daring the other to fall first. The dust, good heavens, the dust! It clung to everything with the tenacity of a lovesick leech, coating the whiskers of every man in a perpetual beige mask and transforming the very air into a gritty soup. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn it constituted the local cuisine. Speaking of sustenance, the saloons boasted a beverage they dared call whiskey, a potent concoction brewed, I suspect, from the tears of disappointed mules and the discarded boots of prospectors who’d finally given up. It tasted of brimstone and regret, and cleared a fellow's sinuses faster than a runaway stagecoach. As for the citizenry, a more peculiar bunch I haven't clapped eyes on this side of the Mississippi. They were a motley crew of gamblers with cards tucked into their suspenders like sacred texts, miners nursing dreams as threadbare as their trousers, and fellas who looked like they'd been chewed up and spat out by the very landscape itself. Their faces, etched with the maps of hard living and dashed hopes, were a study in rugged perseverance, or perhaps just stubborn refusal to admit defeat. One could practically hear the strains of a mournful banjo emanating from their very bones. Now, I don't wish to paint too bleak a portrait. Slade possessed a certain...charm. The sort of charm one might find in a particularly persistent toothache. But, mark my words, charm nonetheless. A testament to the human spirit, if that spirit happened to enjoy wallowing in dust, drinking questionable liquor, and wagering its last dime on a crooked hand.
