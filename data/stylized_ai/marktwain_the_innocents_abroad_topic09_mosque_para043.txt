Now, about these mosques, these 'places of prostration' as the learned fellows call them. A body might find himself quite perplexed, staring at one of these towering structures, all domes and minarets scratching at the heavens like a cat after a particularly elusive dust bunny. They're scattered about the landscape, from Constantinople to Cairo, thick as flies on a treacle tart, each one vying to outdo the next in terms of architectural flamboyance. One might even suspect a secret contest amongst the architects, judged, no doubt, by some celestial panel of stonemasons with an overdeveloped sense of symmetry and a penchant for intricate tilework.

And the calls to prayer, bless my soul! Five times a day, punctually as a tax collector, a fellow with a voice like a rusty gate swings open and unleashes a warbling that echoes through the streets. Enough to wake the dead, and occasionally the living who were trying to enjoy a midday nap. One fellow I knew, a particularly grumpy camel driver named Abdul, swore it was the only reliable alarm clock in the Ottoman Empire. Said it even made his camel jump. I, however, suspect the camel just had indigestion.

But all joking aside – for even Mark Twain understands the limits of humor – there’s a quiet dignity to these places. Step inside, and the world outside, with its petty squabbles and incessant hawkers, seems to fade away. The cool air hangs heavy with the scent of incense, and the light filters through stained glass windows, painting the floor with patterns of color. You see men – and usually just men, mind you, the fairer sex relegated to the sidelines like a forgotten footnote – kneeling in unison, their foreheads pressed to the ground, a silent symphony of devotion. And for a moment, just a fleeting moment, a fellow might even feel a twinge of envy for their certainty. Not enough to convert, mind you. But enough to make him ponder the mysteries of the universe, or at least, wonder where he left his pipe.
