Now, consider the Bedouin, bless their wandering souls. One might call them the Arab's answer to the American hobo, only instead of a bindle and a railroad, they’ve got a camel and a thousand miles of sand that appears precisely the same in all directions. You see them driftin' across the desert, these sons of Ishmael, lookin' for all the world like they misplaced something important back near the oasis and are hopin' to blunder across it any minute. A fellow might be tempted to ask what they are about, this aimless ramblin’, but then he recalls the old saw about a man and his business bein' like strangers on a crowded omnibus, best left to their own affairs. Though, between you and me, I suspect they’re only trying to avoid paying property taxes, a universal pursuit, wouldn't you agree?

They’re a hardy lot, mind you, baked brown by the sun and leaner than a Mississippi riverboat gambler after a string of bad hands. Their tents, made of goat hair and smelling strongly thereof, provide shade that’s about as effective as a politician's promise. And their diet! Dates, camel milk, and the occasional locust if they’re feelin’ particularly fancy. I reckon I’d prefer a plate of hardtack and weevils myself. Yet, somehow, they manage to thrive, these desert rats. They breed like jackrabbits and gossip like hens, all while wearing more clothing than a polar bear at a picnic. Their hospitality is legendary, I’ll grant them that. A man could stumble into their camp half-dead from thirst and they’d offer him the finest dates they own…though I’d be lookin’ mighty close to see if they weren’t counting every swallow of that camel milk while they were at it. Yes sir, the Bedouin. A singular people, indeed. As for me, I will admire them from a safe distance, preferably with a tall glass of iced tea and a sturdy roof over my head. Wandering is fine, but a man needs a good, solid porch to wander *from*.
