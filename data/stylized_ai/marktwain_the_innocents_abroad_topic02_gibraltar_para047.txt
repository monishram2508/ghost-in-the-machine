Ah, Gibraltar, that craggy thumb of rock poking defiantly out of Spain, a British toe stubbed squarely in the Mediterranean. One might call it picturesque, I suppose, if one has a particular fondness for sheer, unyielding stone. The place has history, enough to choke a moderately sized goat, what with the Moors and the Spanish and those tenacious Brits all having a go at it over the centuries. You can practically trip over a cannonball or two whilst strolling the main street, which, by the by, is a veritable bazaar of duty-free this and that, seemingly designed for the sole purpose of separating tourists from their hard-earned shillings. And the monkeys! Lord preserve us from the monkeys. Barbary Apes, they call 'em, though "little feathered imps" might be more apt, given their penchant for pilfering hats, handbags, and the occasional unsuspecting sausage roll. They saunter about with an air of entitlement usually reserved for royalty, and possess a disarming knack for staring directly into your soul, as if judging the quality of your moral fibre. It's unsettling, I tell you, unsettling.

Then there's the tunnel, a warren of passages drilled through the heart of the rock, a subterranean city built by industrious Englishmen during a time when they were excessively concerned with being bombed. One can wander for hours down there, feeling like a mole with a map, encountering the occasional cobweb or a rusty rifle, wondering if perhaps one ought to have invested in a particularly sturdy gas mask before embarking on the journey. The view from the top, of course, is quite something, stretching across the Strait to Africa, a vast expanse of shimmering blue. Worth the climb, one supposes, even if one's lungs feel like they've been used as bellows for a blacksmith's forge. But all in all, Gibraltar is a peculiar place, a curious anachronism, a little bit of England stubbornly clinging to the edge of Europe like a barnacle on a beleaguered ship. One visits, one observes, one buys a souvenir tea towel featuring a particularly grumpy-looking Barbary Ape, and one departs, pondering the enduring mysteries of empire, duty-free liquor, and simian larceny.
