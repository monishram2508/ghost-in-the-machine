Well, I reckon I've seen Mormons thicker than fleas on a mangy hound dog, particularly out there in Utah Territory, where they sprout like weeds in a neglected garden. They’re a curious lot, these Mormons, forever bustling about with that earnest, righteous air that’d shame a parson’s Sunday sermon. Brigham Young, now there was a character, a regular Caesar of the Salt Lake Valley, orchestrating the whole shebang with the savvy of a riverboat gambler and the pronouncements of a modern-day Moses. Polygamy, they called it, a custom that raised more eyebrows than a saloon brawl. Picture a fellow with a wife for every day of the week and then some, a veritable harem domesticating the sagebrush. It seemed like a recipe for marital discord, a symphony of clashing skillets and whispered jealousies, but they claimed it was all divinely ordained, a path to celestial glory, naturally.

And industrious! Lord, they could make the desert bloom like a rose, coaxing crops out of the stubborn earth with a tenacity that’d make a mule blush. Irrigation ditches, meticulously planned towns, all springing from the wilderness like a mirage born of hard work and unwavering faith. They had their detractors, mind you, those pious souls back east who viewed them with suspicion, convinced they were plotting some grand, blasphemous scheme. There was always a whisper of trouble brewing, a sense of impending conflict between the gentiles and the faithful, like a storm cloud gathering on the horizon. But one thing's certain, they were a self-reliant bunch, more than ready to handle whatever life, or the government in Washington, threw at them. And that sort of grit, whether one agreed with their doctrines or not, commanded a certain begrudging respect, like admiring a sidewinder for its ability to survive in the harshest of conditions, even if you'd rather not share your campfire with it.
