We’ve been rambling about the Alps for what feels like an eternity, Adam and I, mostly Adam rambling, mind you, about the superiority of his naming skills. I must confess, some days I feel he’d name a beetle after himself if given half a chance, though he vehemently denies such an impulse. But I digress. We stumbled upon this peculiar formation—a mountain of ice, thick as molasses in January and seemingly just as inclined to movement. Adam, bless his heart, declared it a "Glacier," a title as unimaginative as naming the sun "Shiny Thing." Though, to be fair, my own suggestions fared little better; I was leaning toward "Giant Icy Snail," which Adam claimed was "scientifically unsound," as if we had scientists about just tripping over themselves trying to analyze my nomenclature.

Now, this Glacier, it's quite the spectacle. It crunches and groans like an old man trying to get out of bed, spitting out rocks and debris as if clearing its throat. Adam theorizes it’s moving, ever so slowly, carving the very landscape. Frankly, I suspect it's just being stubborn, refusing to admit that it's tired of sitting in one place. But then again, I've noticed Adam is easily impressed by things that move at a snail's pace. Remember the time he spent an entire afternoon watching an earthworm? He declared it "a marvel of nature," I declared it time wasted that could have been spent finding a nicer apple tree. Anyway, this Glacier, it’s a cold, unforgiving marvel, but it sparkles in the sun and offers us refreshing streams to drink from. Even Adam admits that. Though I’m betting he’ll still take credit for it as soon as he finds someone new to explain it to. All in all, a magnificent sight, however sluggish.
