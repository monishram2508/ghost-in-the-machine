Well, I reckon I spent a spell out in Utah Territory, and couldn't help but bump into a Mormon or two, or maybe two hundred. A peculiar bunch, them Mormons, you bet your boots. Started by a fella named Joseph Smith, who, accordin' to 'em, dug up some golden plates with writing on 'em, translated by divine Providence, or some such fancy. Then, blow me down, he got himself killed by a mob – always a risky business, claimin' revelations and such, particularly if it involves multiple wives. Brigham Young, a fella with the backbone of a grizzly, took the reins and steered 'em westward, clear across the plains, aimin to make a new Zion in the desert. And wouldn't you know it, they did! Salt Lake City sprung up like a mushroom after a rain, all neat rows and irrigation ditches, a testament to hard work and, well, a powerful amount of religious conviction.

Now, about them wives...that’s where things got spicy. Celestial marriage, they called it, a notion that had the Gentiles in a right tizzy. A man could marry as many women as he could reasonably provide for, which seemed a daunting task, considering the size of some of them families. It made for some right curious domestic arrangements, I tell you. You’d see a fella walkin’ down the street, trailed by a whole gaggle of women, all wearin' the same plain homespun dresses, lookin’ for all the world like a flock of prairie chickens followin’ their leader. I heard tell of one fella who kept his wives in separate houses on the same street, numbered like buildings so he didn't get 'em mixed up. A logistical nightmare, if you ask me, but then again, who am I to judge a man’s spiritual path, especially when it involves that much cookin' and mendin'. They ain’t drinkin', smokin', or swearin' either and they make the desert bloom. Smart business.
