Now, concerning this Neckar River, which I made a point of observing with that shrewd eye of mine, well, it's no Mississippi, that much I can confess without shame. You won't find any steamboats puffing and panting up and down its modest bosom, no sir. It's more of a polite stream, a gentlemanly sort of river, content to wind its way through vineyards and little towns, like a well-mannered dog leading a blind man. They say it's ancient, been meandering along since the Romans were stomping about, building bathhouses and generally making a nuisance of themselves. I suspect it’s heard its fair share of whispered secrets over the centuries, though I dare say most of them would be of the “Wilhelm stole Gretel's sausage” variety rather than anything of earth-shattering importance.

You’ll see the locals dallying along its banks, mostly old codgers with fishing poles that look older than they are, hoping to snag a carp or two. The carp, I gather, are about as eager to be caught as I am to sit through another Wagner opera. And bless their hearts, the tourists flock to it, snapping pictures of the castles perched precariously on the hillsides, like so many drunken lords teetering on the edge of ruin. It’s all rather picturesque, I suppose, if you're partial to that sort of thing. But if you ask me, a river ought to be a bit more, well, rambunctious. A touch of grit, a dash of audacity. This Neckar, it’s altogether too civilized. It’s the kind of river that wouldn’t dare flood without sending a formal apology in advance. Still, I reckon it serves its purpose. Keeps the wine flowing, the tourists smiling, and the old fishermen happily engaged in their Sisyphean task of outsmarting the carp. And who am I to argue with contentment? Even if that contentment is served with a side of rather bland fish.
