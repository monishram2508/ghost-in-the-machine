Them miners, bless their gold-dusty souls, were a breed apart, I tell you. They weren't your lily-livered, parlor-room dandies, no sir. They were men forged in the belly of the earth, hardened by sun, sweat, and the eternal hope that tomorrow's dig would be the one to strike it rich. You'd see 'em shuffling into town, come Saturday, looking like they'd wrestled a grizzly and lost – clothes torn, beards full of granite and dreams, eyes squinting like a badger cornered in a biscuit tin. They moved with this peculiar gait, a sort of subterranean shuffle, like they were still trying to navigate a tunnel even on solid ground. Now, some folks might’ve reckoned them a rough lot, what with the cussin' that could curdle milk and the general disregard for fancy manners. But underneath that crust of dirt and grit, there was often a heart of gold, or at least the potential for one, should they ever stumble upon the real thing. They'd blow their earnings on whiskey, cards, and fandango girls faster than you could say "Eureka!", and then be back in the mine come Monday, hacking away with renewed vigor, fueled by nothing more than the ghost of Saturday night's revelry and the tantalizing prospect of another motherlode. They were a superstitious bunch too, believed in pixies in the shafts and omens in the quartz veins. A misplaced pick, a crow flying the wrong way, or even a dream about a bald-headed Chinaman could send 'em into a tizzy, convinced the mine was jinxed. And heavens to Betsy, don't get them started on the claim jumpers. That was a topic that could turn a prayer meeting into a barroom brawl quicker than a greased pig could escape a lasso. All in all, though, they were the engine that drove this here boomtown, a hard-living, hard-working, and perpetually hopeful lot, these miners. And if they weren't exactly saints, well, at least they were honest in their pursuit of sin, which is more than you can say for some of them slick-talking lawyers back East.
