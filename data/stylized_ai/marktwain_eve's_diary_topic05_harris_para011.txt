Harris, now there's a specimen. A fellow of contradictions, that one. Claims to be a pillar of efficiency, a walking timetable, yet consistently manages to misplace his spectacles even while they're perched upon his nose. Observes him, you must, to believe it. He'll be ranting about the punctuality of trains, that grand old lie peddled by the railway companies, while his own pocket watch is lagging a good fifteen minutes behind, like a tired tortoise trailing a hare. And his memory! Bless his heart, it's as reliable as a weather vane in a hurricane. One minute he's regaling you with the complete lineage of the Pharaohs (apparently gleaned from a cracker box), and the next he's forgotten where he put his pipe, which, knowing Harris, is likely tucked behind his ear, emitting a faint aroma of burnt badger.

He's a man of enthusiasms, Harris is. Temporary enthusiasms, mind you. He'll be seized by the fever of poultry farming one week, expounding at length on the merits of bantam hens and the art of hatching fertile eggs, and the next he's utterly consumed by the study of Mesopotamian drainage systems, having abandoned the poor chickens to the tender mercies of the neighborhood cats. He possesses, this Harris, a talent for taking the most mundane tasks and turning them into feats of staggering complexity. Simple errand to the grocer for a loaf of bread? With Harris, it becomes a veritable odyssey involving consultations with multiple shopkeepers, exhaustive price comparisons, and a detailed analysis of the bread's crustal integrity. By the time he returns, clutching the loaf like a precious artifact, the original purpose of the expedition (which was, as I recall, to make a simple sandwich) has been entirely lost, replaced by a grand dissertation on the socioeconomic factors affecting the price of wheat. Ah, Harris, a walking, talking, slightly bewildered comedy, he is. A puzzle wrapped in a riddle, inside a slightly moth-eaten tweed suit. You can't help but love him, even as you're secretly plotting to hide his glasses.
