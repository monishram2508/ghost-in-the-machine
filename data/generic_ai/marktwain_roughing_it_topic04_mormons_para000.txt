Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a religious tradition that emerged in the United States during the 19th century, founded by Joseph Smith. At its core, Mormonism shares foundational Christian beliefs, emphasizing the divinity of Jesus Christ, the importance of the Bible, and the need for salvation through faith and repentance. However, it distinguishes itself through its unique scriptures, notably the Book of Mormon, which Smith claimed to have translated from golden plates revealed to him by an angel. This text, along with other scriptures such as the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, are considered supplemental to the Bible and provide additional guidance and doctrines. A key tenet of Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, asserting that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets today, as he did in biblical times. This belief justifies the additions to scripture beyond the Bible and is central to their understanding of God's ongoing relationship with the world. Mormon theology emphasizes a premortal existence, the importance of family, and the potential for eternal progression. The church places a strong emphasis on missionary work, with young adults often dedicating one to two years to proselytizing around the world, sharing their beliefs and inviting others to join the faith. Temple worship is another distinctive feature, involving sacred ordinances such as baptisms for the dead and eternal marriage, performed in dedicated temples considered houses of the Lord. Socially, Mormons are known for their close-knit communities, emphasis on family values, and commitment to service. The Church also maintains a strict health code called the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. While often categorized as Christian, Mormonism's unique scriptures and theological perspectives have led to ongoing debate and differing views on its place within the broader Christian landscape. Despite historical controversies and ongoing scrutiny, the Church has grown significantly, establishing a global presence and becoming a prominent voice in discussions on faith, family, and community.
