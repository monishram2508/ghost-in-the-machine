I declare, if I were to design a mountain, I'd make it somewhat less perpendicular, just out of common courtesy to its inhabitants. Take, for instance, the chamois, bless their scraggly little hearts. They flit and flutter about those dizzying heights like bits of blown-out dandelion fluff caught in a tornado. One moment they're there, clinging to a crag no wider than a gentleman’s cravat, the next they've vanished, apparently into thin air. It's a performance that's both breathtaking and rather anxiety-provoking, especially if you're inclined to wager on their survival. I once lost a perfectly good sovereign betting against a particularly reckless specimen I'd christened "Daredevil Dan," who promptly leaped across a chasm that made even my mustache hairs stand on end.

Now, these chamois, they possess a gravity-defying swagger that suggests they’re quite certain they're descended from angels, or perhaps runaway hot air balloons. They sport these comical little horns, like a pair of slightly bent exclamation points, permanently punctuating their surprise at finding themselves in such precipitous circumstances. And their coats! Well, they're a study in autumnal hues – various shades of brown, as if they'd been accidentally dropped in a vat of weak coffee. One has to suspect they are quite aware of the ridiculousness of their attire, which perhaps explains their perpetual look of mild embarrassment.

I’ve watched them for hours, you know, sprawled comfortably (as one can be on a bed of rocks) with my field glasses, trying to decipher their daily routine. It seems to consist primarily of eating things that appear entirely inedible, gazing haughtily at the valley below, and occasionally engaging in what I can only describe as synchronized leaping. One moment they're grazing with the utmost seriousness, the next they're all off, bounding about like so many wind-up toys set on high. It's utterly bewildering. I suspect they're either deeply philosophical, completely insane, or possibly both. I tend to lean towards both. It would certainly explain a great many things about life, wouldn't it?
