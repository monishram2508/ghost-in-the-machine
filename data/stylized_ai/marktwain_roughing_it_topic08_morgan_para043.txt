Now, this here Morgan, he was a specimen, I tell you what. Looked like he’d been carved out of a redwood stump with a dull axe, and just about as lively, too, most days. Came out West with a carpetbag full of dreams and a head full of dust, same as the rest of us fools. He reckoned he’d strike it rich in silver, build himself a mansion with a turret and a weather vane shaped like a gold prospector, and marry a gal with a smile that could charm the birds out of the trees. Bless his heart, he hadn’t even managed to find a decent-sized robin, let alone a silver vein.

He was a carpenter, you see, but his hammer seemed to have a personal vendetta against every nail he encountered. Spent more time cussing at bent nails than he did actually building anything. Put together a chicken coop for Mrs. Abernathy, ended up looking like a Cubist painting gone wrong, chickens took one look at it and emigrated to Nevada. Tried his hand at prospecting, too, of course, figured anyone could chip at rocks and get rich. Found a whole lot of granite and a family of gophers, though, no silver to speak of. He swore those gophers were laughing at him, and I wouldn't put it past 'em.

But Morgan, bless his stubborn soul, he never gave up hope. He'd sit on the porch of the saloon, nursing a sarsaparilla and spinning yarns about the fortune he was just about to make. Always "just around the corner," that fortune of his. He was the eternal optimist, that Morgan, the kind of fella you couldn’t help but feel sorry for, and secretly admire, even if he couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn with a banjo. He might not have found his silver mine, but he sure did mine a good supply of stories, and that, in these parts, is worth more than gold sometimes. He was a reminder that even the most outlandish dreams could keep a man going, even when the only treasure he ever found was the setting sun.
