Now, a sepulchre, you see, isn't just a hole in the ground, no sir. It's a hole in the ground tarted up something fierce. Think of it as a fellow who ain't done an honest day's work in his life, but struts about in a velvet waistcoat, hoping nobody notices the holes in his boots. That's your sepulchre. We Americans, bless our industrious hearts, we mostly stick to plain pine boxes, good enough for worms and reckoning souls, no need for fancy frippery. But in the old countries, particularly them dripping with kings and bishops, they go in for sepulchres like a hog goes for slop. Marble, mostly, and tons of it, carved up with angels weeping like it's their job (and likely, it was). Columns taller than a man can spit, inscriptions longer than a temperance lecture, and always, always, a grand pronouncement of who's sleeping inside, and how important they imagined they were.

You'll find them cluttering up churches like dusty old furniture, these sepulchres, each one a silent testament to the vanity of mankind. The deceased inside is likely just as dead in a simple ditch, but his relatives, bless their ambitious hearts, they needed to make a statement. "See?" they proclaim to the world, "He was somebody! Or at least, we spent enough money to pretend he was!" And the poor soul, stuck inside, can't even roll over and tell them to knock it off. It's a grand spectacle, really, the sepulchre. A monument to the fleeting nature of life, paid for with the very riches it insists on showcasing. Makes you wonder what the worms think of it all, munching away on a king, indifferent to the carved stone outside. I reckon they find it a rather pretentious bedchamber, myself. Probably prefer a nice, plain pine box, easy to navigate and without all the unnecessary angels looking on.
