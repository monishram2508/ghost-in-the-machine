Baden, you say? Ah, Baden-Baden! A place where one is practically obliged to perspire refinement from every pore, whether one wants to or not. It's a veritable garden of delights for the afflicted rich, a gilded cage where they gather to take the waters, gamble with more determination than good sense, and compare the sparkle of their diamonds with a fervor that could melt glaciers. The air itself seems infused with the perfume of money and the faint whisper of lost fortunes. One can scarcely take a step without tripping over a Grand Duke disguised as a humble gentleman, or a Baroness whose lineage is longer than the Rhine itself. They’re all there, of course, hoping to snatch at a fleeting moment of happiness, or perhaps just to escape the even more dreadful boredom of their own estates. The conversation, while undeniably polished, tends toward the tedious – a relentless cycle of discussing ailments real and imagined, the merits of various spas (Baden, naturally, reigning supreme), and the outrageous prices charged for a decent slice of Black Forest cake. And oh, the fashion! One sees costumes that would make a peacock blush, creations so elaborate and impractical that one can only assume they were designed by an enemy masquerading as a couturier. I recall one lady, in particular, whose gown resembled nothing so much as a particularly ornate wedding cake, complete with sugar swans and spun-sugar fountains. She moved with the grace of a heavily laden wagon, but by Jove, she looked impressively wealthy while doing it. The whole place, you see, is a grand performance, a carefully orchestrated charade played out by characters who are all desperately trying to convince themselves, and each other, that they are having the time of their lives. Which, between you and me, is probably about as likely as finding a sober Prussian at an Oktoberfest. And yet, one can't help but be rather fond of the place, in a peculiar, ironic sort of way. It's like a delightfully absurd play, and one can’t help but find oneself chuckling along with the madness of it all.
