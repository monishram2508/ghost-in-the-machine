Now, about this pard, or “partner,” as some folks fancied to call ‘em, a creature you’d often stumble upon in them mining camps and burgeoning towns of the West. He was a feller generally bound to ye by some sort of unspoken, half-baked agreement to split the profits, or the losses, or maybe just the general misery that life tended to ladle out in them parts. I had a pard once, name o’ Silas. A fella built like a scarecrow and twice as loud, claimed to be a dab hand with a pickaxe, but I swear he spent more time sharpening it than swingin’ the blasted thing. Said his method was all about precision, which I reckon was a fancy word for laziness. We struck a deal, half shares in whatever we found, thinkin’ we’d be knee-deep in gold nuggets before the week was out. Well, the closest we got to gold was the color of Silas’s beard after he’d been chawin’ tobacco all day.

The thing about a pard, though, is he’s often yer only companion in a land where companionship is scarcer than a teetotaler at a saloon. You’d share yer grub, yer fire, yer yarns, and yer gripes, even when you were privately considerin’ pushin’ him down a mine shaft for snoozin’ on the job. He’d be the fella you trusted to watch yer back when you were knee-deep in a claim, prayin’ some claim jumper didn’t decide to stake his own claim on yer head. And Lord knows, he'd be the one you’d argue with the loudest, usually over some fool notion he had about the best way to find gold, which always seemed to involve dowsing rods or followin’ the flight path of a particularly dim-witted buzzard. But truth be told, a pard, even a cantankerous, lazy one like Silas, was a comfort, a familiar face in a world full of strangers. Someone to laugh with when things went right, and someone to cuss at when they went horribly, hilariously wrong, which, more often than not, they did. Just try not to rely on them too much, because as reliable as the sun in the west, that gold fever can change a man quick.
