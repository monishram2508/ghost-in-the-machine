Chamonix, they call it, a nest of craggy grandeur clutched in the bosom of those, shall we say, *imposing* Alps. Imagine, if you will, a valley so crammed with rock and ice that even the most optimistic cow would hesitate before planning a picnic. The place is swarming with tourists, bless their optimistic souls, all draped in more Gore-Tex than is strictly necessary for a stroll to the patisserie. They arrive with eyes wide, ready to wrestle with nature’s raw might, though the closest most will get to actual grappling is a spirited negotiation for the last pain au chocolat. One finds oneself wondering if the mountains even notice them, these brightly colored ants swarming at their feet, taking pictures of things that have been there for epochs and will doubtless remain long after the last selfie has faded from the digital ether.

And the guides! Oh, the guides, with their weathered faces and ropes like unruly serpents coiled about their waists. They speak of crevasses with the breezy nonchalance of a housewife discussing the price of eggs, and one half expects them to pull a map of the Mont Blanc massif from their beard, instead of just the usual crumbs of yesterday's baguette. It's a curious spectacle, this human endeavor to conquer that which cannot be conquered, merely tolerated. One feels a certain sympathy for the mountain, really. All that stoic endurance, all that majestic silence, and then these blithering interlopers arrive, clamoring for bragging rights and a mediocre fondue. Yet, there's a peculiar charm to it all, I suppose. A testament to human folly, perhaps, but also to that irresistible itch we all have to poke our noses into things that are none of our business. In short, Chamonix is a rather stimulating place, if one enjoys observing the human comedy unfold against a backdrop of sublime indifference. Just remember to pack a good pair of boots, and a healthy dose of skepticism. You'll need both.
