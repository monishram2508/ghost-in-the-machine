Now, about this bucksheesh business, which, mind you, ain't a buck at all, but a bit of a nuisance, and a lubricant to the machinery of daily life in these here exotic lands. Imagine, if you will, a fella wishing to cross a bridge; why, that bridge-keeper ain’t gonna let him pass without a little something changing hands, a small offering to the god of greased palms, as it were. A shilling, a piastre, a sweet, or maybe a cigarette, depending on the value of the bridge and the fellow's apparent prosperity. It’s expected, you see, like flies at a picnic, or politicians making promises. You can object to it, certainly; you can stand there and bluster and quote the Magna Carta, but you'll find yourself still standing there come sunset, with dust devils mocking your righteous indignation.

And it ain’t confined to bridges, no sir. It pervades everything, thick as molasses in January. Want your bags carried at the train station? Bucksheesh. Want a decent table at the restaurant? Bucksheesh. Want the policeman to overlook that minor indiscretion involving a camel and a lady’s hat? Well, friend, you better have a substantial wad of bucksheesh ready. One might call it extortion, highway robbery even, but that’s putting it rather strongly. It's more like…a gentle persuasion, a friendly nudge in the direction of cooperation, with the understanding that cooperation comes at a slight premium. It’s a fine art, this bucksheesh business, a delicate dance of offering and acceptance, a silent negotiation conducted with winks and nods and a carefully calculated exchange of small coins. It can be irritating, to be sure, especially when one is fresh off the boat and bursting with the misguided notion that rules and regulations actually mean something. But after a while, you start to understand, you start to appreciate the rhythm of it, the subtle charm of this ongoing transaction that keeps the wheels of commerce turning, albeit with a slightly squeaky sound. And, if you're clever, you might even learn to use it to your advantage, turning the tables on them and extracting a little bucksheesh of your own. But be warned, my friend, for the art of giving bucksheesh is only surpassed by the art of receiving it, and the locals are, as a rule, masters of both.
