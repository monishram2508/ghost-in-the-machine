Higbie, a name resonating within the realms of naval history and maritime engineering, often evokes images of a distinctive vessel and a remarkable individual. Jesse Wellens Higbie, born in 1831, dedicated his life to the U.S. Navy, leaving an indelible mark through his service and contributions. He ascended through the ranks, distinguishing himself during the Civil War, particularly in the blockading squadron. His leadership and tactical acumen proved invaluable in hindering Confederate supply lines, ultimately contributing to the Union's victory. He was commended for his bravery and efficiency in several engagements. Beyond his battlefield prowess, Higbie possessed a keen interest in naval technology and demonstrated a natural aptitude for engineering. This inclination eventually led him to play a pivotal role in the development and implementation of innovative maritime advancements within the Navy.

However, Higbie is perhaps most widely known as the namesake of the USS Higbee (DD-806), a Gearing-class destroyer commissioned in 1945. This warship was a testament to his legacy, a tangible embodiment of his dedication and service. The USS Higbee holds a special place in naval history as the first U.S. Navy warship named after a female member of the service. Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee, Jesse Higbee's wife, was a pioneering nurse and the Superintendent of the Navy Nurse Corps during World War I. The unusual distinction of naming a destroyer after a woman, especially a nurse, signified a shift in societal perspectives and a growing recognition of the contributions of women in the armed forces. The USS Higbee served with distinction during the latter stages of World War II and the Korean War, participating in numerous operations and earning several battle stars. It stands as a symbol of courage, commitment, and the enduring legacy of both Jesse and Lenah Higbee, demonstrating how a man’s service can be honored and intertwined with his wife's accomplishments. The story of Higbie is a reminder that innovation, bravery, and dedication to service can have a ripple effect, inspiring generations and shaping the course of naval history.
