Damascus, they call it the "Pearl of the Orient," which sounds grand enough, I suppose, until you actually get there and find the pearl has a bit of grit and tarnish. Been around since, well, Methuselah probably stopped in for a fig or two. A city with more layers than an onion crying into the Euphrates. History oozes from every crack in the pavement, sticky and sweet as date syrup. You can hardly swing a dead cat – not that I recommend trying it, mind you, though I’ve seen worse things done in the bazaars – without hitting a ruin older than your grandma's gossip. The streets themselves are narrower than a miser's heart, twisting and turning like a politician dodging a straight answer. You'd think with all that history, they’d have figured out indoor plumbing by now, but I suspect the Romans held onto the blueprints just to keep the Syrians guessing. 

Oh, the noise! A symphony of donkey brays, hawkers hollering about carpets that are “genuine Persian, guaranteed!” (though suspiciously resemble a flock of molting pigeons), and the ever-present bleating of sheep heading to their final reckoning. Makes a man long for the quiet solitude of a New York tenement, nearly. And the dust! Enough to build a second Damascus, brick by gritty brick. I swear, I coughed up more sand in a week than a camel buries in its lifetime. But, bless their cotton socks, the people are a curious lot. Hospitable as all get-out, once they figure out you're not there to steal their rugs. They’ll offer you tea sweeter than sin and tell you tales tall enough to make Baron Munchausen blush. Just don’t ask about the Crusades. Seems a bit of a sore spot, still. All in all, Damascus is a marvel, a mess, and a mystery, all rolled into one dusty, noisy, utterly unforgettable package. Worth the trip? Well, that depends. Are you fond of history, strong coffee, and the distinct aroma of goat? If so, saddle up, pilgrim. You're in for a ride.
