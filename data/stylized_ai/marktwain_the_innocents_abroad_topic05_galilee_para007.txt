Now, Galilee, bless its heart, is a curious sort of place. One hears tell of it being lush and fertile, a veritable Eden of the East. Well, I reckon that’s what folks say who’ve never spent a scorching afternoon swatting flies the size of bumblebees whilst trying to coax a stubborn mule cart up a hill that seems to have no top. Lush, they say? I suppose if you consider rocks covered in sun-baked shrubbery "lush," then alright. There are patches, mind you, where the soil relents and yields a decent crop. Olives, mostly. Enough olives, I wager, to grease every politician's palm from here to Constantinople. And the Sea of Galilee, they call it. A sea, mind you, no bigger than a decent-sized puddle after a rainstorm back in Missouri. But it’s got a fine reputation, I grant you that. Tiberias, on its shore, tries to pass itself off as a resort town, full of folks with more shekels than sense, haggling over trinkets and bathing in water probably cleaner in my old washbasin.

They claim this is where miracles happened, mind you. Fish being multiplied, water being walked upon, demons being evicted from unfortunate souls and sent into pigs—the whole shebang. Well, I didn’t see any of that, though I did see a vendor trying to sell me a "genuine" piece of the True Cross, carved, apparently, from the finest Galilean olive wood. I told him I’d sooner buy a plot of land on the moon. He didn't get the joke. The people of Galilee, bless their simple souls, are earnest folk, dedicated to their small plots of land and their ancient customs. They will tell you stories with faces so sincere, you almost believe them, even when you can tell they're embellishing at least a third of it. All in all, Galilee is a place of contradictions, a land of dust and dreams, where the past hangs heavy in the air and where, if you squint just right and ignore the flies, you can almost, just almost, see the shimmer of a miracle. Just be sure to check the price of that olive wood cross before you buy it. You'll thank me later.
