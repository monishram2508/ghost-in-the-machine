The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, traces its origins to the visions and teachings of Joseph Smith in the early 19th century. Smith claimed to have discovered and translated ancient golden plates containing the Book of Mormon, which, alongside the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, forms the scripture of the faith. A core belief revolves around the idea of continuing revelation, the notion that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets in modern times, with the church president serving as the current prophet. This distinguishes them from many other Christian denominations that believe revelation ceased with the Bible. Mormons believe in a trinitarian Godhead comprised of God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, though their understanding of the Godhead differs in some respects from traditional Christian theology. Family plays a central role in Mormon life, with emphasis on eternal families sealed together through temple ordinances. They prioritize marriage and raising children, believing that family relationships can continue beyond death. The Church promotes a strict moral code, emphasizing honesty, integrity, chastity, and abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs, often summarized in the "Word of Wisdom." Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving two-year missions to proselytize and serve others around the world. Temple worship is distinct from regular Sunday services, involving sacred ordinances and covenants considered essential for eternal progression. Temples are not open to the general public, but require adherents to be worthy members of the church, evidenced by a "temple recommend." While the church has historically faced scrutiny and challenges, particularly regarding its early practice of polygamy (officially discontinued in 1890), it has grown into a global faith with millions of members worldwide, actively involved in humanitarian efforts, community service, and promoting its unique theological perspective.
