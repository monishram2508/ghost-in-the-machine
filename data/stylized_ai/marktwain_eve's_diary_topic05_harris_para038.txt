Harris, bless his simple heart, is a conundrum wrapped in a homespun riddle, tied with a string of utter guilelessness. He’s one of those fellas who could tell you the sky is purple with green polka dots, and you’d find yourself squinting at it, just to be sure you hadn’t missed something spectacular. It ain’t that he lies, mind you. Heavens forbid! It’s just that his observations are filtered through a lens of pure, unadulterated… well, let’s call it optimism. He once swore he saw a cat playing the banjo, a tune remarkably like “Old Dan Tucker.” Now, I’ve known cats, and played a banjo or two myself, and I can confidently declare that the two rarely, if ever, intersect. But Harris, he stood his ground, eyes wide, insisting the critter even tipped its hat to him afterwards.

He’s got a way of simplifying things, too, stripping away all the pesky nuance and complexity that plagues the rest of us. The stock market? “Just bet on the fella with the biggest hat,” he’d advise. Politics? “Pick the one who smiles the most, the rest is just fancy talk to confuse you.” Love? “Find a gal who can cook a decent pot of beans and doesn’t mind your snoring.” It’s a philosophy so simple, it’s almost genius, or perhaps just plain boneheaded. One can never quite tell with Harris. He'll tell you about the time he wrestled a bear for a picnic basket, or how he single-handedly rerouted the Mississippi River with a shovel and a cussed determination, and you wouldn't know whether to believe him or to laugh him out of the state. Probably a little of both. He's a walking tall-tale, that Harris, a reminder that sometimes the most entertaining stories are the ones that never quite happened, or at least, not quite the way he tells them. And heaven help you if you ever find yourself playing poker with him – he’ll clean you out with a hand he claims he learned from a family of talking squirrels.
