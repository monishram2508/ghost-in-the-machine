Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked hides, are a rum lot. One comes across them drifting across the desert like tumbleweeds, only instead of thorny shrubbery, they’re hauling goats and complaining about the price of camels. They claim to be descended from some ancient sheiks and whatnot, though I suspect half of them are descended from fellows who got lost on their way to the market and decided to adopt a more picturesque profession. You see them lounging about in the shade of their tents, brewing coffee that’ll curl your hair, and spinning yarns about genies and buried treasure. Of course, I’ve yet to meet one who’s actually found any of this treasure, which leads me to believe either the genies are remarkably stingy or the Bedouins are keeping it all for themselves.

Their sense of direction is something to behold. Ask them for directions to the nearest oasis, and they’ll point vaguely towards the horizon and declare it’s “just over there,” which, in desert miles, could mean anything from a leisurely afternoon stroll to a three-day trek with a camel that’s determined to lie down every ten minutes. And their hospitality, well, it’s legendary, though I confess it does come with a certain degree of…thoroughness. They’ll offer you the finest goat’s milk and dates, then proceed to haggle over the price of your boots as if they were priceless relics. Still, one can't help admire their resilience, their ability to squeeze a life out of the harshest landscape. They may not be kings and queens, but they are certainly lords and ladies of the sand, content in their ways, and perpetually suspicious of anyone wearing shoes that haven't been properly scuffed by the desert wind. You’ll find them quite happy, if you can get past the sand, the coffee, and the occasional attempt to sell you a carpet that mysteriously appeared from under a rock.
