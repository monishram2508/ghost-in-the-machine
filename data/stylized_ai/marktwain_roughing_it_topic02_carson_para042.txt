Carson City, ye gods, what a place! I reckon if you were to set about designin' a town with the express purpose of makin' a man homesick for the Sahara, you couldn't do much better. It sits there, a-bakin' in the Nevada sun like a forgotten loaf of bread, lookin’ like the very embodiment of a half-hearted promise. Streets wide enough to drive a stagecoach through – not that anyone *is* drivin' stagecoaches these days, mind you, except maybe for the tourist trade, which I suspect amounts to two fellas and a tumbleweed. Buildings that seem to be whisperin' secrets about boom and bust, tales of fortunes made and lost quicker than you can say "silver lode." And speaking of silver, you'd think with all the fuss they made 'bout it, the town'd be paved with the stuff. Nope. Just dust. Dust finer than a politician's promises and just as easily blown away.

The folks there? Well, they're a peculiar breed. A mixture of miners turned shopkeepers, shopkeepers tryin' to look like miners, and politicians tryin' to look like they’re doin’ somethin’ besides collectin' taxes. They’re fond of pretendin' things is prosperous, even when the only money changin' hands is in the saloons, and even then, mostly for credit. They'll tell you all about the next big strike that's gonna put Carson on the map, just like they told you 'bout the last dozen. You listen politely, nod your head, and wonder if maybe a good stiff drink might make the optimism contagious. The air is thick with anticipation, and even thicker with the scent of sagebrush and disappointment. All in all, Carson City has a certain…charm. The charm of a broken-down piano that's only got one key, and that key is slightly out of tune. You can't help but admire its persistence, even if you're hopin' the next stagecoach heads in the other direction.
