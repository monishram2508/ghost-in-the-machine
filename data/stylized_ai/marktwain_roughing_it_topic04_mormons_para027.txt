Well, I reckon I spent a spell in Utah, and you can't swing a cat there without hitting a Mormon, or at least some relative of one. They’re thick as flies on a molasses barrel, these Latter-day Saints, or "Saints" as they like to be called, though whether they're any holier than the rest of us, I ain’t qualified to judge. Seems to me that claiming sainthood is about as presumptuous as a coyote in a church choir, but I'm no theologian, just a simple observer of the human circus. They're a curious lot, industrious as beavers and sober as judges, at least outwardly. Some folks whisper about the old days, about multiple wives and whatnot, but nowadays they mostly keep that under wraps, like a rattlesnake under a blanket. They’ve got this Prophet Smith fella, whose book they swear is gospel truth, even though it reads stranger than a dime novel on a bender. They preach about golden plates and angels appearing, and you either swallow it whole or you're an apostate, destined for damnation quicker than a greased pig at a county fair.

Now, I’ll say this for the Mormons: they’re generous, at least to their own kind. They look after each other like a family of squirrels hoarding nuts for winter. Buildin’ temples finer than any I saw back East, shiny white things that stick out like sore thumbs against the desert landscape. And they’re clean! I’ve never seen a population so obsessed with cleanliness. Their towns look like they’ve been scrubbed with lye soap morning, noon, and night. Maybe they figure if they keep the outside spick-and-span, nobody will notice the peculiar goings-on inside. They're keen on sending young lads out on missions, spreading the good word all over the globe. I reckon they’re hoping to convert the whole world, one earnest handshake and pamphlet at a time. Whether they'll succeed or not, well, that's a question for the ages. But one thing's for sure, they're a force to be reckoned with, these Mormons, a peculiar, prosperous, and persistent bunch. And like it or not, they're a mighty interesting part of the American tapestry, even if that tapestry is woven with some mighty strange threads.
