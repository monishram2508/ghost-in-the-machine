Zermatt, you see, is one of those places that tries, and might I add, mostly succeeds, in convincing you it’s all a dream. A dream dreamed, perhaps, by a particularly fond, somewhat addled, Swiss clockmaker after a heavy lunch of cheese and something that tasted suspiciously like old boots. The first oddity, of course, is the absence of those infernal contraptions they call motorcars. Gone! Vanished! As though some celestial prankster plucked them away, leaving only little electric buggies that purr about like contented, metallic kittens. A most peculiar state of affairs, I assure you, especially when one is accustomed to being nearly run over by a fiendishly grinning driver at every street corner.

Then there’s the Matterhorn, that jagged, toothy mountain that stands guard over the village, flaunting its stony grandeur like a dowager dripping in diamonds. It’s so omnipresent, so very *there*, that one almost expects it to offer a curt nod as you pass. One might even be forgiven for thinking it's a stage prop, cleverly hoisted into place each morning before the tourists arrive, lest they be disappointed by a landscape slightly less…mountainous.

And the people! Oh, the people of Zermatt. A jolly, robust lot, seemingly built from the very rocks they inhabit. They bustle about with a certain Alpine urgency, their cheeks perpetually rosy, as though they've just returned from a brisk waltz with the Abominable Snowman himself. One cannot help but feel a certain envy, a yearning for such rosy-cheeked vigor, even if it does come with the implicit risk of encountering said Abominable Snowman. And the prices, good heavens, the prices! One pays enough for a simple cup of coffee to practically buy the whole blessed mountain, bit by bit. But then again, perhaps that's the point. Perhaps they are slowly, painstakingly, selling off the Matterhorn, one overpriced cup of coffee at a time. It’s a thought that makes one contemplate a career in the coffee import business, though I suspect the locals are far too clever to fall for such an easily hatched scheme. All in all, Zermatt is a captivating conundrum, a delightful absurdity, and well worth the price of admission, even if one does leave slightly poorer and utterly bewildered.
