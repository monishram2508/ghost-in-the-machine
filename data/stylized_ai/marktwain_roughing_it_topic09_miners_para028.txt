Now, these miners, bless their optimistic hearts, were a breed apart, I tell you. A feller could strike up a conversation with one fresh off the boat from Cornwall, dirt clinging to him like a second skin, and by the end of it be convinced that man was about to unearth a silver lode bigger than the Comstock itself. Lord, the dreams they had! Every pick swing was a gamble, every tunnel a lottery ticket dangling in the smoky air. You'd see ‘em come into town, flush with dust and tales of near misses, buyin’ up the saloons and treatin’ all comers like royalty, only to be back in the mines next mornin’, coughin’ up black lung and chasin’ that fickle Lady Luck once more.

They were superstitious too, like a cat crossed your path wearin' a rabbit's foot. A raven croakin' meant disaster, whistlin' in the tunnels brought down the roof, and Heaven forbid you brought a woman underground, lest she jinx the whole operation. Yet, despite all the back-breakin' labor, the danger, and the near certainty of comin’ up short more often than not, they kept at it. Perhaps it was the glint of gold fever in their eyes, or maybe it was just plain stubbornness, but they dug on, deeper and deeper into the belly of the earth. They were a rough bunch, mind you, quick with a cuss and even quicker with a fist if you questioned their claim or their ancestry. But under that gruff exterior, they were loyal as a hound dog and generous to a fault, especially to those down on their luck. Many's the time I saw a miner, barely makin' enough to keep body and soul together, share his meager grub with a down-and-out prospector, hopin' to give the fella a second wind and a chance at strikin' it rich. They were a strange lot, these miners, full of grit and glory, and in their own way, carved out not just fortunes, but the very backbone of this here Wild West.
