A glacier, a colossal river of ice, is a dynamic entity sculpted by the relentless forces of gravity and climate. Formed over centuries, even millennia, from the gradual accumulation and compression of snow, glaciers represent a tangible record of Earth's past environmental conditions. As snowflakes pile upon snowflakes, the increasing weight crushes the underlying layers, expelling air and transforming the delicate crystals into dense, granular ice. This process, known as firnification, culminates in the formation of solid glacial ice, a substance capable of flowing under its own immense weight. The movement, though often imperceptible to the naked eye, is driven by the pull of gravity and the internal deformation of the ice itself. Faster flow rates typically occur in the center of the glacier and near the surface, where there is less friction.

Glaciers are not static formations; they are constantly evolving, either advancing or retreating in response to fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. During periods of cooler temperatures and increased snowfall, a glacier's accumulation zone expands, adding more ice than is lost through melting or evaporation in the ablation zone. This leads to glacial advance, a slow but powerful march across the landscape. Conversely, warmer temperatures and reduced snowfall cause the ablation zone to dominate, resulting in glacial retreat, where the terminus, or snout, of the glacier recedes up-valley. This delicate balance between accumulation and ablation determines the overall health and stability of a glacier, making them sensitive indicators of climate change. The impact of glaciers on the surrounding landscape is profound. As they flow, they carve out valleys, transport vast quantities of sediment, and sculpt unique landforms like moraines, eskers, and cirques. They also act as crucial reservoirs of freshwater, storing significant amounts of water in frozen form and releasing it gradually during warmer months, providing a vital source of water for rivers, ecosystems, and human populations downstream. The shrinking of glaciers worldwide, therefore, poses a significant threat to water resources, sea-level rise, and the stability of mountain ecosystems.
