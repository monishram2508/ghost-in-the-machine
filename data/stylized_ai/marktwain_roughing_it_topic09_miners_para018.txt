Now, these miners, bless their hopeful, ignorant hearts, were a breed apart. You’d find ‘em scattered like buckshot all over these here hills, each with a pick, a pan, and enough optimism to float a steamboat. Most of ‘em couldn’t tell quartz from a cucumber, but by thunder, they could spout geological theories that’d make a professor blush. One fella, called "Lucky" Bill – though the irony was thicker than mud after a spring rain – insisted he could smell gold. He'd sniff the ground like a hound dog after a coon, then plant himself smack-dab on a spot and declare, "Boys, this here's the mother lode!" Of course, it never was. Usually, it was just a particularly stubborn rock or a disturbed badger sett. 

They were a superstitious lot, too. Wouldn’t whistle in a mine shaft for fear of collapsing the whole shebang, and woe betide anyone who dared bring a parson within a mile of their claim. Parsons, they reckoned, brought bad luck, which, considering how often they were skunked, was a prejudice hard to argue with. And their cooking! Lord have mercy, their cooking could curdle milk at fifty paces. Beans, bacon, and biscuits – the trinity of the miner’s diet – usually cooked over a fire that could char a buffalo at sunset. I swear, I once saw a biscuit so hard, a fella used it to drive a nail.

But despite their shortcomings, their ignorance, and their culinary catastrophes, they were a hearty bunch. They'd face floods, cave-ins, claim jumpers, and even each other with a grin and a curse. They were dreamers, every last one of them, chasing the ghost of fortune in these desolate hills. And though most of them would end up no richer than when they started, they’d have stories enough to fill a book – tall tales, mind you, but entertaining nonetheless. And that, I reckon, is worth more than all the gold in California.
