The Bedouin, an Arabic term meaning "desert dweller," represent a diverse group of nomadic Arab peoples who have historically inhabited the arid regions of North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Levant. Their traditional way of life revolved around animal husbandry, primarily the herding of camels, goats, and sheep, which provided them with essential resources such as milk, meat, wool, and transportation. The harsh desert environment shaped their culture, fostering resourcefulness, resilience, and a strong sense of community. Survival depended on their deep knowledge of the desert landscape, including the locations of water sources, seasonal grazing patterns, and optimal routes for migration. This intimate understanding was passed down through generations, forming the foundation of their nomadic existence.

Social structures within Bedouin tribes were typically hierarchical, with a sheikh or tribal leader responsible for maintaining order, resolving disputes, and representing the tribe's interests. Kinship played a crucial role, with strong family ties and a complex system of reciprocal obligations. Hospitality was, and often still is, a cornerstone of Bedouin culture, considered both a moral imperative and a practical necessity in a harsh environment where travelers relied on the generosity of others for survival. The offering of food, shelter, and protection to strangers, even potential enemies, was a deeply ingrained custom. Oral tradition was vital in preserving their history, customs, and values. Poetry, storytelling, and music served as important forms of entertainment, education, and cultural expression, transmitting knowledge and social norms across generations. Despite modernization and sedentarization affecting many Bedouin communities in recent decades, their cultural heritage continues to be cherished, with efforts underway to preserve their traditions, language, and unique way of life. Many continue to maintain aspects of their nomadic lifestyle, adapting to modern challenges while striving to retain their distinct identity as desert dwellers.
