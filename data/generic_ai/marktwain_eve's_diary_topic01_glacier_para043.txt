A glacier, a colossal river of ice, is formed over centuries through the gradual accumulation and compression of snow. The sheer weight of the accumulating snowfall compacts the lower layers into dense, crystalline ice. This transformation is a slow and methodical process, where snowflakes, initially light and airy, become granular and eventually merge into solid glacial ice. Glaciers are not static entities; they are dynamic systems that are constantly moving, albeit at varying speeds. The movement is driven primarily by gravity, causing the ice mass to flow downhill or outwards from its accumulation zone, the area where snow accumulates faster than it melts. The rate of movement depends on several factors including the glacier’s mass, the slope of the underlying terrain, the temperature of the ice, and the presence of meltwater at the base. Meltwater, acting as a lubricant, can significantly accelerate the glacier's flow.

As glaciers move, they sculpt the landscape, carving out valleys, transporting vast quantities of sediment, and leaving behind distinctive landforms such as moraines, eskers, and cirques. The abrasive power of the ice, laden with rocks and debris, erodes the bedrock beneath, creating characteristic U-shaped valleys that starkly contrast with the V-shaped valleys formed by rivers. The sediment carried within and on top of the glacier, known as glacial till, is deposited in various forms as the ice melts and retreats. Moraines, ridges of accumulated till, mark the former extent of the glacier's advance. Eskers, sinuous ridges of sediment deposited by meltwater streams flowing beneath the ice, provide evidence of the glacier's internal drainage system. Cirques, bowl-shaped depressions carved into mountainsides by glacial erosion, are often the starting points for glaciers. The study of glaciers, known as glaciology, provides vital insights into past climate conditions and helps us understand the impacts of ongoing climate change. Glaciers are sensitive indicators of temperature fluctuations, and their shrinking size and accelerated melting rates serve as a stark warning about the warming planet.
