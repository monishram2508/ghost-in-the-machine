Galilee, bless its heart, is no place to write home about if you're expecting pyramids or marble statues. Why, you could ride a camel clear across it in a day, provided the beast didn't succumb to the boredom and lay down for a nap in the dusty road. I've seen more excitement in a Missouri cornfield on a Sunday afternoon. The Sea of Galilee, mind you, is touted as a body of water, though I reckon a good-sized pond in Connecticut might give it a run for its money in terms of size. They say Jesus walked on it, which, considering its dimensions, might not have been as miraculous as some folks make out – a good swimmer could probably do the same, though perhaps without the fanfare. Tiberias, that ancient city shimmering on its shore, claims history aplenty, but history, you see, has a habit of exaggerating. Mostly I found it full of flies, beggars, and the persistent hawkers of trinkets carved from olive wood. Still, the hills that roll down to the water have a certain charm, though I’ve seen hills in upstate New York that boast just as much. The real wonder, I suspect, isn't in the landscape itself, but in the tales spun around it. Every rock, every dusty path, every sun-baked village claims some connection to the Good Book. The air hangs heavy with scripture, and even the most heathen heart can't help but feel a tingle of something – perhaps reverence, perhaps indigestion from the questionable food. They say the air is filled with the ghosts of apostles and miracles, but I suspect that's mostly the locals trying to up the ante on tourism. But who am I to say? Maybe after a few strong cups of Galilean wine, one might just see a water-walking apparition or two. If you squint hard enough, that is. Just don’t expect them to tip well.
