Now, this Neckar, this river they call the Neckar, it’s a German river, naturally. Everything over here seems to be either a beer hall or a river; sometimes, confound it all, it’s both. And this Neckar, she’s no Mississippi, bless her little heart. The Mississippi, that's a river with gumption, a river with stories etched in its muddy banks, a river that knows a thing or two about steamboats and the occasional rascal. The Neckar, well, the Neckar ambles. It meanders. It putters along like a plump little hausfrau on her way to market, laden with cabbage and good intentions. She's charming, I grant you, all lined with tidy little towns sporting half-timbered houses that look for all the world like they're about to topple over from too much gemütlichkeit. You see castles perched on the bluffs, each one more picturesque and utterly useless than the last, remnants of robber barons who probably spent more time polishing their armor than actually robbing anyone.

The Germans, they are exceedingly fond of their Neckar, and who can blame them? It's not as though they have a choice, really. They boat upon her placid surface, sip their local wines along her banks, and generally treat her with a respect bordering on reverence. They even write poetry about her! Can you imagine? Poetry! About a river that mostly just...exists? But then again, these Germans are a poetic lot, always pondering the meaning of everything and finding beauty in the most remarkably mundane things. I suspect if you gave them a ditch filled with ditchwater, they’d pen an ode to the translucence of the sediment. Still, the Neckar has its merits. It's peaceful, it's pretty, and it's infinitely less likely to flood and carry away your entire house than, say, the aforementioned Mississippi. And that, my dear, is a virtue not to be sneezed at, especially when you consider the exorbitant cost of replacing one’s furniture. So, raise a glass of Riesling to the Neckar, the river that proves that even a perfectly ordinary body of water can be rendered utterly captivating, provided you have enough castles and half-timbered houses to gussy it up a bit.
