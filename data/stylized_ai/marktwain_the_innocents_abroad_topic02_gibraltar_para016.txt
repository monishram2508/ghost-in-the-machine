Gibraltar, bless its soul, is a sight to behold, though one might wonder if it wasn't accidentally pinched off Spain like a careless baker's poorly measured dough. A colossal, ungainly rock it is, jutting defiantly into the sea, as if daring Neptune himself to send a rogue wave and dislodge it. The thing has an almost comical air of self-importance, standing there like a pompous gentleman with a particularly prominent nose. Now, I've heard tell it commands a strategic position, controlling the passage between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, but I suspect its true purpose is to serve as a roost for the most audacious apes I've ever laid eyes on. These Barbary macaques, they call 'em, and they are the undisputed lords of the land, or at least, of the tourist trade. They'll snatch your spectacles right off your face, filch your sandwich with the speed of a pickpocket in a crowded bazaar, and generally treat you like a walking, talking snack dispenser. You can't help but admire their sheer audacity, though I wouldn't recommend getting too close, lest you end up missing a button or two. The town itself, perched precariously on the rock's western slope, is a hodgepodge of architectural styles, a testament to the various empires and adventurers who've laid claim to this little spit of land. You’ll find British pubs cheek-by-jowl with Spanish tapas bars, and the general atmosphere is one of amiable confusion. It’s a place where you might hear English spoken with a distinct Andalusian lilt, and find yourself paying for a pint with euros while being watched by a simian monarch plotting your demise. All in all, Gibraltar is a curious little anomaly, a geological oddity populated by brazen primates and a people who seem to have mastered the art of shrugging off the weight of history. It’s a place that both amuses and confounds, and one that I suspect will continue to do so for centuries to come, unless those blasted apes finally decide to stage a full-scale revolt.
