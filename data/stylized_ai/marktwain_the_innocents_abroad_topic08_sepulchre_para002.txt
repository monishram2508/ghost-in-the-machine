Now, a sepulchre, you say. It sounds like a word a dentist might use when he’s about to yank a molar, doesn’t it? “Just hold still, and we’ll have this sepulchre extracted in no time!” But no, a sepulchre, as far as I can ascertain, is a fancy grave. Not just a plain, honest dirt nap with a headstone that reads “Here Lies Jedediah, He Wore His Boots to Bed,” but something altogether more…architectural. Think of it as the five-star hotel of the afterlife, the sort of place where pharaohs and robber barons would feel right at home, surrounded by all the gilt and gaudery their dearly departed hearts could desire.

I’ve seen a few sepulchres in my day, naturally. Mostly in Europe, where they seem to have a positive mania for burying folks in style. You get the feeling they’re not entirely convinced that Heaven is all it’s cracked up to be, so they’re trying to make the interim period as comfortable as possible. And the things they do to these tombs! Marble angels weeping perpetually, Latin inscriptions that nobody can read anymore, and enough carved cherubs to populate a small town. One almost expects a butler to pop out from behind a sarcophagus and offer you a sherry. 

It strikes me as a bit of a waste, if you want my honest opinion. All that money and effort, just for a pile of bones that won’t know the difference between a sepulchre and a ditch. And who’s to say the dearly departed wouldn’t rather have that money spent on something useful, like a decent school or a saloon that serves proper whiskey? But I suppose it’s a matter of taste. Some folks like their afterlife to be opulent, while others are content with just not being eaten by worms. Personally, I’m hoping for a hammock and a good book. And maybe a friendly ghost to share a yarn with. Now that, my friends, would be a sepulchre worth writing home about.
