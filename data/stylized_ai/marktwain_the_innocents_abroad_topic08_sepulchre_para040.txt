Now, a sepulchre, you see, ain't just a hole in the ground covered with a rock, though some might treat it so. Nay, it's a proper house for the departed, a grand declaration that a fella ain't just worm-fodder, but a personage of some consequence, even in death. I’ve seen sepulchres that’d make a king jealous – built like little temples, adorned with carvings finer than a politician's promise, and filled with enough marble to sink a Mississippi steamboat. They’re that elaborate, truly, as though the deceased is expecting company and wants to impress with the latest in afterlife decor.

Of course, the whole business strikes me as a bit of a flimflam. Here we are, sweating and toiling, trying to scrape together enough shillings for a decent supper, while others are spending fortunes on what amounts to a fancy, dirt-covered box. It seems a mite excessive, don't it? I mean, I reckon the dead are likely past caring if their coffin is lined with velvet or stuffed with old newspapers. And frankly, the thought of spending eternity in a cold, damp vault, no matter how opulent, doesn’t exactly set my pulse a-racing. Give me a sunny porch and a glass of lemonade any day of the week, thank you very much.

But there's a certain human vanity at play, I suspect. It's not really about the dead, it's about the living showing off – letting everyone know they could afford to bury their loved one in style. A grand sepulchre is a statement, a proclamation of wealth and status that echoes louder than any funeral dirge. It’s the ultimate posthumous flex, a final opportunity to outshine the Joneses, even if the Joneses are already pushing up daisies themselves. And ain’t that the human condition in a nutshell? Always trying to one-up each other, even when one is six feet under. Makes you wonder if the angels don't have a good chuckle watching us down here, fretting over who has the fanciest tombstone.
