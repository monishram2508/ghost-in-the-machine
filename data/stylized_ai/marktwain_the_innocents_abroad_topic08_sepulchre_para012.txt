Now, about this sepulchre business. It's a curious thing, ain't it? Folks get so riled up about these stone boxes after someone up and kicks the bucket. You'd think the deceased, having shuffled off this mortal coil, wouldn't much care whether they're planted six feet under a weeping willow or stuck in a fancy-dancy crypt with more carvings than a politician's promises. But no, there's all this fuss and bother, as if the departed are still keeping tabs on their earthly real estate.

I reckon the real audience ain't the dead, it's us, the living. We build these magnificent mausoleums, these everlasting edifices, not for the benefit of the dust and bones within, but for the benefit of our own pride and pocketbooks. Shows everyone just how important we are, or *were*, I suppose, if we're the ones inside. A fella can't help but wonder if the angels up yonder get a good chuckle out of it all. Imagine them, looking down at us scrambling to outdo each other in sepulchre splendor, whispering, "Well, ain't they just precious? Still clinging to the notion of earthly significance, even after they've lost the ability to argue about taxes."

And the epitaphs! Lord have mercy, the epitaphs! You'd think every stiff in the graveyard was a saint, a genius, and a philanthropist, all rolled into one. Never mind that he spent half his life chasing skirts and the other half cheating his business partners. On his tombstone, he's suddenly a paragon of virtue. Makes a body question whether they're talking about the same varmint. It's enough to make a fella long for the days when they just carved "Here lies Joe," and left it at that. At least that was honest. But no, we gotta gild the lily, even on the way out. Seems we're determined to put on a show, right up to the very end. I suppose it's human nature, this grand performance. But sometimes, I reckon the worms are the only ones getting a truly unbiased view of the whole darn spectacle.
