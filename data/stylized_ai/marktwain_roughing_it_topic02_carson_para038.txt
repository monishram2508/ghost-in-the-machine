Carson City. A pocket-sized metropolis, they call it. More like a pocket lintropolis, if you ask me. I reckon the entire population could fit comfortably in a reasonably sized circus tent, with room left over for a particularly lazy bear act. Why, I've seen ant hills busier than a Carson City Saturday night. But don't let its diminutive stature fool you. Oh, no sir. Carson is the political heart of this here Nevada, a state notorious for having a heart only slightly larger than a gnat's eyebrow. It's where the laws are hatched, the fortunes squandered (mostly the state's), and the deals cut so crooked they'd make a snake blush.

Now, the legislature, bless their cotton socks, is a sight to behold. A collection of gentlemen, and a sprinkling of ladies, mostly resembling farmers who wandered in off the back forty and accidentally got handed a gavel. They deliberate with the gravity of a goldfish trying to solve a Rubik's Cube, and the results are generally about as coherent. One fellow, I recall, spent a whole afternoon arguing whether the state flower should be the sagebrush or a prickly pear. Seemed a vital matter to him. Meanwhile, the silver mines were playing possum and the grasshoppers were plotting world domination.

Then there's the Governor's mansion, a grand affair, comparatively speaking, that sits perched atop a slight rise. It looks down on Carson with an air of regal condescension, as if to say, "Yes, I know you're all a bunch of dusty dreamers, but I'm keeping an eye on you." Rumor has it, the Governor spends most of his time inside trying to figure out how to stretch the state's budget, which is about as elastic as a dry biscuit. He likely dreams of gold and wakes up to more unpaid mining bills. Still, Carson has a certain charm, a sort of end-of-the-road, what-you-see-is-what-you-get honesty. It ain't much, but it's honest. Or, at least, as honest as a politician can be in a town built on silver and sustained by the faint hope of striking it rich. A hope, mind you, that's about as likely as finding a sober mule skinner in a saloon at midnight.
