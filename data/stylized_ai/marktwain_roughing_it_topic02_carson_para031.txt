Carson City, you say? Well, now, there's a spot on the map that could use a good scrubbing, both figuratively and, I suspect, literally. It squats there in the dust like a tired old hound dog, panting under the Nevada sun, and just about as lively. I reckon if you stuck a thermometer up its tailpipe, it’d register somewhere south of tepid. Folks call it the capital, which is a highfalutin’ term for a place where men in ill-fitting suits spend their days arguing about things that matter about as much as a fly buzzing ‘round a mule’s behind. Gold and silver brought ‘em flockin’ in like vultures to a carcass, minds set on gettin’ rich quick and leavin’ just as quick. Some did, and some stayed, and I’d wager the ones that stayed probably lost their way tryin’ to leave.

The streets themselves are wide enough to drive a herd of elephants through, but you’re more likely to encounter a stray tumbleweed or a politician lookin’ lost than any majestic beast. The buildings, bless their sun-bleached hearts, sport a look of faded grandeur, like a dowager queen tryin' to recapture her youth with a bad wig and too much rouge. They whisper tales of boom and bust, of Comstock kings and queenly harlots, though mostly you just hear the wind whistlin’ through the cracks in the windowpanes. And the saloons? Oh, the saloons! Full of the same sad stories as anywhere else, just served with a little more dust and a little less refinement. They still pour a mean whiskey, though, I’ll give ‘em that. Keeps the ghosts of ambition company, I suppose. All in all, Carson is a place that ain't much to look at, ain't much to do, and ain't likely to set your soul on fire. But it’s got a certain grit to it, a stubborn refusal to be anything other than what it is: a relic of a wilder time, slowly sinkin’ into the desert sand, and clinging to its peculiar brand of faded glory with both hands. And sometimes, I reckon, that’s enough.
