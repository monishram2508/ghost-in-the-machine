Now, Harris, that specimen of sturdy humanity – sturdy in build, at least, though his mental framework resembled more a rickety gazebo after a hailstorm – Harris, I say, possessed a peculiar knack for attracting calamity, a talent I’d wager he was born with, perhaps even bartered for in some unholy pact made with a particularly disgruntled gremlin. We were attempting, on a day that started out promisingly sunny, to navigate the Thames, a task I’d imagined would be a pleasant diversion, a bucolic balm for the soul. Harris, however, had other plans, or rather, a singular plan: to thoroughly demoralize the riverbank’s inhabitants and transform a serene excursion into a comedy of errors worthy of the stage.

First, he insisted on steering, a decision immediately regretted by yours truly, as he navigated the little vessel with the grace of a drunken walrus attempting ballet. We zigzagged across the river, nearly capsizing into the startled lap of a picnicking family on the opposite bank, much to their audible dismay and the visible terror of their prize-winning poodle. Then, bless his oblivious heart, he decided to demonstrate his ‘expert’ knot-tying skills. Lord, the knots! They resembled more a tangled nest of vipers than anything resembling nautical expertise. We spent a good half-hour attempting to unravel the mess, during which time, I swear, I aged a decade and contemplated a career change that involved more solitude and significantly fewer Harris-related incidents.

And then, as if the river gods themselves were conspiring against us, the rain arrived. Harris, naturally, had forgotten the waterproofs. So there we sat, drenched to the bone, battling a gale, while Harris rummaged through the picnic basket, apparently more concerned with locating a stray pickle than with our imminent drowning. The entire experience, I must confess, left me questioning the very sanity of engaging in any activity that involved Harris and open water. Perhaps next time, I'll stick to the parlor, a good book, and a healthy dose of skepticism whenever Harris suggests a "relaxing" outing.
