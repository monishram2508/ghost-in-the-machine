The Neckar, bless its heart, is a river of such unassuming character, one might almost mistake it for a glorified ditch. Not that I mean to be unkind, you understand, for it does its duty, transporting barges laden with whatever treasures those industrious Germans deem worthy of conveyance, be it coal dust or sausages. And it’s ever so picturesque, in that quaint, Germanic fashion, with its half-timbered houses clinging to its banks like barnacles on a particularly stubborn whale. Why, I swear I saw a goose, just yesterday, waddling along the towpath with an air of such solemn purpose, one would think it was personally responsible for the entire region’s prosperity. The castles perched precariously above the Neckar are another thing altogether; grand, imposing structures, seemingly built solely to remind one of the futility of earthly ambition. They stand there, crumbling ever so elegantly, whispering tales of knights and princesses and wars fought over, no doubt, the most trivial of offenses. One can almost hear the echoes of clashing swords and the rustling of silk gowns, though more likely it's just the wind whistling through the broken battlements. The river itself, though, remains imperturbable, meandering onward with the serene indifference of a confirmed bachelor at a village dance. I’ve noticed, too, that the sunsets over the Neckar are particularly prone to histrionics, splashing the sky with hues of orange and purple and gold, as if trying to compensate for the river's inherent lack of flamboyance. Makes one wonder if the river itself even notices, or if it’s too busy fretting over the next barge filled with sauerkraut to pay any mind to such fleeting beauty. Likely the latter, I suspect, for the Neckar, like most things German, is nothing if not practical.
