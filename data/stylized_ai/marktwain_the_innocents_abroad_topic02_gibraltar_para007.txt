Gibraltar, a place, by Jove, that sticks out like a sore thumb, or perhaps more accurately, a calcified toe stubbed on the endless Mediterranean. Aye, a veritable geologic oddity, it is, rising defiant from the sea, a lump of limestone daring the winds and waves to have their say. One is struck, upon first sighting it, by its utter improbability. It looks for all the world as though some giant, in a fit of pique, plucked a chunk of the Sierra Nevada clean off its moorings and chucked it haphazardly into the Strait. And there it sits, playing sentinel for the English, bless their hearts, who cling to it with the tenacity of barnacles on a long-forgotten galleon. They do say the apes, the Barbary macaques as they call ‘em, are the true inheritors of the rock. Scoundrels, every last one! Bold as brass, they are, these little imps, picking pockets with more finesse than a seasoned London pickpocket. One must keep a sharp eye on one’s spectacles, and even sharper eye on one’s luncheon, for they’ll have it away quicker than a politician promising reform. They are, I suspect, in cahoots with the local merchants, who gleefully sell overpriced trinkets to the bewildered tourists, no doubt financed by the apes’ ill-gotten gains. The town itself, a proper muddle of narrow streets and sun-baked buildings, has a decidedly British air about it, though liberally seasoned with a Mediterranean spice. Fish and chips jostle for attention with tapas, and red phone boxes stand defiantly beside Moorish archways. The inhabitants, a curious blend of nationalities and accents, seem quite content to bicker in a dozen different languages about the price of duty-free whisky. One can’t help but wonder, whilst gazing out upon the endless blue expanse, what all the fuss is about. But there it is, Gibraltar, a small rock with a large story, a testament to stubbornness, empire, and, of course, the eternal allure of a good bargain.
