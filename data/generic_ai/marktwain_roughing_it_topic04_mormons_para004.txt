Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, emerged in the United States in the 19th century with Joseph Smith as its founder. At its core, the faith shares many commonalities with Christianity, emphasizing Jesus Christ as the Savior and holding the Bible in reverence. However, Mormonism distinguishes itself through its belief in additional scriptures, most notably the Book of Mormon, which Smith claimed to have translated from golden plates revealed to him by an angel named Moroni. This text, along with other revealed writings like the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, is considered scripture alongside the Bible and provides further doctrine and historical context.

A central tenet of Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, asserting that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets in modern times, just as he did in biblical times. This belief informs their openness to adapting doctrine and practices as they receive divine guidance. They believe in a triune Godhead, though their understanding differs from traditional Christian theology, with God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost being distinct and separate beings united in purpose. Latter-day Saints also hold unique beliefs regarding the nature of the afterlife, including the concept of eternal families sealed together through temple ordinances. Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving full-time missions, spreading their faith across the globe. Their commitment to community is strong, emphasized through regular attendance at church services, participation in church activities, and adherence to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which discourages the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. Over time, the Church has become a global organization, known for its strong emphasis on family values, self-reliance, and humanitarian efforts, while also navigating complex discussions and evolving perspectives on issues like LGBTQ+ inclusion.
