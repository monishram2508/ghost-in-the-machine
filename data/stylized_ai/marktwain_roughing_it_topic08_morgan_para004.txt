Now, Morgan. There was a feller, not precisely a saint, mind you, nor even the roughest sort of angel what might’ve fallen on hard times out Nevada way, but a human contraption through and through. He hailed, as I recall, from somewheres back East where they refine politeness like silver and dish out respect on a teaspoon – habits he promptly shed like a rattlesnake’s skin the moment he crossed the Mississippi. Morgan, he wasn’t one for gilding lilies, unless gilding lilies meant covering ‘em in playing cards and betting a month’s wages on which lily would wilt first.

He possessed a mind quicker than a greased pig at a county fair, though its workings were often as mysterious to me as the habits of a hen in a thunderstorm. He could wheedle a miner out of his gold dust with a smile sweeter than sorghum and then turn around and use it to buy a team of mules known only for their stubbornness and complete lack of forward locomotion. His logic, it meandered like a lost river in the desert, but somehow always seemed to end up at the desired destination: usually a saloon or a promising poker game.

He claimed, with a wink that could stop a clock, to have been everything from a riverboat gambler to a travelling dentist, and I’m inclined to believe at least half of it, which is to say, none of it. Morgan could spin a yarn thicker than a California redwood, and deliver it with the earnest conviction of a preacher promising salvation. You’d be hanging on every word, convinced you were hearing the gospel truth, right up until you realised you’d just been convinced to buy a patent medicine guaranteed to cure everything from consumption to Tuesday-itis. Still, I’ll grant you this, he was never boring. In a land where excitement was often measured in degrees of dehydration or the frequency of gunfights, Morgan was a walking, talking, somewhat disreputable sideshow all on his own. A scoundrel? Maybe. A rascal? Certainly. But dull? Never.
