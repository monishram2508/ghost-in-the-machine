Well, I reckon I’ve seen sights in my time, what with Adam always dragging me hither and yon on some fool's errand or another, but none so peculiar as this river of ice. They call it a glacier, which sounds to me like something a physician would prescribe for a chill, but bless my bloomers, it's nothing of the sort. It's a mountain of ice, mind you, but moving—oh, agonizingly slow, like a snail with a headache, or Adam trying to remember where he left his fig leaf. This particular one, I saw when my dear husband and I journeyed way up north. It gleamed such a pale blue I felt I was looking at the sky fallen down and frozen stiff.

And the sounds! A glacier groans and grumbles like a grumpy old patriarch, creaking with the weight of a thousand winters. It'll crack and pop louder than Adam's bones after he’s been wrestling with a woolly mammoth. And when a chunk of it breaks off, why, it's like the whole world is sighing a long, sad breath before sending ice falling from heights greater than trees! People say it's caused by things beyond simple life, the changes to the air itself.

I asked a man what caused it to move, and he went on and on about gravity and pressure, words that all sounded equally confusing as when Adam tries to explain why we have to keep naming all these critters. So, I have come to the conclusion of my own: I think the glacier moves 'cause it's homesick. It remembers the North Pole and is just trying to get back where it belongs, pushing and shoving its way through the land like a stubborn child determined to get back to his mama. Or maybe it's just showing off, you know how nature can be. Whatever it is, it’s a sight to behold, and one I wouldn't trade for all the pears and peaches in Eden. Though, if the darn thing decides to melt and flood the garden, I might change my tune, and start carrying an ark on my back, just to be safe.
