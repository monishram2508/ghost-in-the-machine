Well, I reckon I’ve seen a thing or two in my time, but this glacier business is a spectacle fit to curl your eyelashes. Imagine, if you will, a river, not of water, mind you, but of ice. Ice solid enough to make even the most stubborn mule reconsider its position on movement. This glacier ain't no dainty, melt-in-your-mouth ice cream. This is the granddaddy of all ices, a behemoth dragging its chilly carcass down a mountain like a bride late for her wedding, only considerably slower and considerably less apologetic.

Now, they tell me it moves, these learned fellas with their spectacles and clipboards. Moves! Why, I could plant a turnip in front of this thing and come back next spring and it’d still be getting a good sun tan. But they insist it does, inching along at a pace that would shame a snail on tranquilizers. And as it goes, this icy beast just scoops up the mountainside like a hungry child after a particularly large helping of mashed potatoes. Boulders the size of houses, trees that have stood for centuries, all crunched and ground down like so much grist for its mill, which I suppose it is, in a way.

And the sounds! Grinding, groaning, cracking like a thousand old bones protesting the cold. It's a symphony of discomfort, orchestrated by Mother Nature herself, and conducted with a frosty baton. You half expect to see the glacier clutch its back and mutter about its rheumatism. Folks flock to see it, naturally, humans being what they are, always eager to witness the slow, inexorable destruction of something grand. They stand there, snapping pictures with their contraptions, oohing and aahing at the sheer audacity of it all. I dare say, if a glacier could wink, it would, just to show them who's really in charge. And then it’d go right back to its glacial pace, chewing on the scenery and reminding us all that even the most solid things can be worn down, given enough time and a healthy dose of cold-hearted indifference.
