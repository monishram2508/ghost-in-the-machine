Carson, you say? Well, now, there's a town that could charm the hinges off a brass kettle, and bore you deader than a doornail all in the same afternoon. A paradox it is, a conundrum wrapped in sagebrush and alkali dust. It sits there, squatting like a prosperous toad, right at the foot of the Sierra Nevada, pretending to be civilized while the wilderness peeks over its shoulder, laughing fit to bust. They call it the capital, you know, the beating heart of Nevada. Though I reckon a tin lizzie engine backfiring has more rhythm and vim. I saw the legislative halls once, full of fellas lookin' important and spewin’ pronouncements weighty as a hummingbird's sneeze. Laws gettin' made quicker than you can boil a pot of coffee, though whether they actually do any good is a matter best left to saloon debates and philosophers with nothing better to ponder.

The streets are wide enough to turn a freight wagon, which comes in handy seeing as half the population is either coming from or going to Virginia City, and the other half is busy tryin' to sell 'em somethin' they don't need. You'll find grand hotels, built like Roman temples on the sweat of Comstock miners, standin' shoulder-to-shoulder with shanties that make a coyote's den look palatial. They're filled with eastern money trying to buy a western spirit, and a western spirit tryin' to get its hands on some eastern money. Mostly, I reckon, they both end up feelin' cheated. But don’t fret too much, for just when you are about to decide Carson is nothing but a collection of ambitions and misplaced civic pride, some old coot will saunter by on a mule, offer you a plug of tobacco and a story so tall it’ll make your hat fly off and then, by gum, you’ll see the soul of the place. It's a town that’ll drive you crazy or charm your socks off, and I haven't quite decided which it did to me. Still, I wouldn't mind another slice of that apple pie at Mrs. O’Malley’s place, even if it does cost a man a small fortune.
