Now, this Coliseum, bless its venerable heart, is a spectacle that fairly tickles the ribs of imagination, though I suspect it may have tickled a few ribs rather more directly in its younger days. Imagine, if you will, a bowl of stone the size of a small town, and not a terribly clean town at that, mind you. One can picture the Emperor, puffed up like a poisoned toad and sweating like a summer melon, holding court up there, deciding who shall live and who shall, shall we say, contribute to the burgeoning fertilizer industry. They say the sands ran red with blood, which is a dramatic touch, of course, though I suspect a good deal of that red was perfectly respectable Tuscan wine spilled during particularly rousing rounds of betting. 

And the animals! Oh, the lions and tigers and bears – oh my! Though I daresay the bears were rather less prone to whimsical Dorothy-esque pronouncements. Picture them, poor devils, roused from their naps in far-flung corners of the Empire, stuffed into cages barely bigger than a hatbox, and then thrust into this arena, where they’re expected to perform a dramatic dance with a heavily armed fellow in a tunic. No wonder they looked grumpy! It's enough to make a Baptist preacher take to drink, I tell you. And the gladiators, those strapping lads oiled up like Thanksgiving turkeys and eager to demonstrate their skill in the ancient art of disembowelment. They were celebrities, you know, almost as popular as a politician promising lower taxes – and just about as likely to deliver on that promise, I suspect. One can almost hear the roar of the crowd, a great, unwashed chorus of cheers and jeers, a sound guaranteed to curdle milk at fifty paces. It’s all quite impressive, really, this monument to carnage and spectacle. Makes one wonder what marvels of barbarity future generations will erect to celebrate, say, the efficient automation of tax audits. Food for thought, wouldn't you say? Or perhaps, in this case, more appropriately, fodder.
