Now, about this portier, or portière, as some fancy-pants folks call it, you know, one of those heavy, draped curtains hanging in a doorway like a tired old uncle after Thanksgiving dinner. Seems like a simple enough contraption, meant to keep out drafts and whatnot, but let me tell you, there's more to it than meets the eye. First off, the name itself is enough to cause a mild apoplexy. "Portier" sounds like some foreign dignitary with a penchant for bad poetry, and "portière" is just plain showing off. Why can't we just call it a "door-curtain" and be done with it? Simplicity, I tell you, is a virtue lost on these modern times.

But the real humbuggery lies in the expectation it sets. A portier promises privacy, a sanctuary, a barrier against the prying eyes and boisterous intrusions of the world. And what does it deliver? A flimsy bit of fabric that flutters with the slightest breeze and reveals all the secrets it swore to keep! You might as well hang a fishing net and call it Fort Knox. And the sound! Why, a mouse tiptoeing across the rug makes less racket than someone attempting to slip past a portier without alerting the entire household. It’s a symphony of rustles and shuffles, a theatrical announcement of one's presence that completely undermines the entire purpose.

Then there's the question of decoration. Some folks go and embroider them with flowers and birds, transforming a simple draft-dodger into a garish display of domestic "art." Others opt for velvet so thick it could smother a small dog, turning their doorway into a theatrical stage. Honestly, it's enough to make a body yearn for the simple days when doorways were just doorways, uncluttered by pretense and unburdened by expectations. Give me a good old-fashioned door, with a proper latch and a satisfying slam, any day over one of these deceptive, drafty, and overly-ornate portiers. A door at least *tries* to keep things out. This fancy fabric just whispers sweet lies about privacy while letting the cold air, and the gossip, slip right through.
