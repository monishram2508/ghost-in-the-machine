Zermatt, you say? A village clinging to the skirts of the Matterhorn like a burr to a mule's tail. A preposterous little place, stuffed to bursting with more gilded chalets and fur-draped ladies than you can shake a Swiss chocolate stick at. It’s a town where the air itself seems to carry the scent of fondue and freshly printed banknotes. You arrive, perhaps, in one of those peculiar little electric carts, chugging along with a sound like a constipated bumblebee, having been unceremoniously deposited at the edge of town by a train that dares not proceed any further. Gasoline, you see, is verboten, a crime against nature punishable, I suspect, by banishment to Zurich, which, between you and me, is a far crueler fate than death by avalanche. 

The cobblestone streets are crammed with a gaudy pageant of tourists, all swathed in expensive woollens, snapping photographs of the Matterhorn as if it might vanish at any moment. And bless their hearts, perhaps it will. Geology, after all, is a patient but relentless fellow. The entire village seems predicated on the worship of this one, particularly pointy mountain. You'd think they'd never seen a hill before. I dare say, a decent anthill in Missouri has more personality. Yet, there they stand, gazing upwards with an almost religious fervor, as if the Matterhorn holds the answers to the universe, or at least the secret to a perfectly aged Gruyère. And of course, the shops! Laden with cuckoo clocks that chirp incessantly, Swiss Army knives that could disembowel a small bear, and enough chocolate to keep Willy Wonka in business for a millennium. One is tempted to buy it all, and then promptly throw it off the nearest precipice, just to feel the thrill of rebelling against such rampant commercialism. Still, one can’t deny the sheer audaciousness of it all. Zermatt is a spectacle, a carefully constructed illusion of rustic charm, designed to extract every last franc from the pockets of the unwary traveler. And yet, somehow, it’s charming precisely because of that absurdity. You can’t help but admire the Swiss for their dedication to turning a mountain into a money-printing machine. They’ve got that thing running smoother than a cog in a Rolex, I tell you what.
