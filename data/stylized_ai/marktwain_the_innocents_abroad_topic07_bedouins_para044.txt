Now, about these Bedouins, bless their wandering souls. One might think a fellow with a camel and a tent has life figured out, a minimalist existence, if you will. But let me assure you, simplicity ain't always simple. I saw 'em out there in the desert, draped in enough cloth to sail a small schooner, swigging coffee strong enough to tan leather, and arguing over the price of a goat like it was the Crown Jewels. You'd think a fellow who spends his days contemplating the endless horizon wouldn't be fussing over a few piasters, but no, sir. Human nature, it seems, flourishes even amongst the sand dunes.

They're a peculiar bunch, these Bedouins. Fiercely independent, they are, with a code of honor stricter than a New England schoolmarm. Hospitality, they call it. Offer a man food, water, and shelter, even if he's just robbed you blind. Strange logic, you might say, but then again, who am I to judge? I once saw a Bedouin share his last date with a starving camel, then proceed to haggle over the price of a rug with a merchant who looked like he hadn't seen water in a decade. The man had his priorities, I'll grant him that.

And their camels! Oh, those mournful beasts. They look at you with an expression that suggests they know the secrets of the universe, and are deeply disappointed in what they've found. They lumber along, carrying tents, wives, and a mountain of possessions that would make a pack mule weep with envy. I once asked a Bedouin how he could stand to travel with those stubborn critters. He shrugged, took another swig of that potent coffee, and said, "They carry my troubles, Effendi. And I carry theirs." Now, I don't know if that's philosophy or just resignation, but it stuck with me, I confess. These fellows are full of contradictions, these desert wanderers. Noble and stubborn, generous and shrewd, and utterly, hopelessly, fascinating. You might not want to trade places with them, but you sure as shootin' want to hear their stories.
