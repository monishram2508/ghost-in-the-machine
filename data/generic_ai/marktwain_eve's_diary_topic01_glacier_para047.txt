A glacier is a colossal, enduring body of ice, formed over centuries from the gradual accumulation and compaction of snow. These icy rivers, often described as "rivers of ice," are not static entities but rather dynamic systems, constantly moving under the relentless force of gravity. Their formation typically begins in high-altitude or high-latitude regions where snowfall exceeds melt during the year, leading to the progressive build-up of snowpack. As the snow accumulates, its weight compresses the lower layers, transforming individual snowflakes into granular ice called firn. Continued pressure from overlying snow gradually compacts the firn, squeezing out air and increasing the density to form glacial ice, a solid, crystalline mass. This process can take decades, or even centuries, depending on the climate and snowfall rates.

Glaciers are not uniformly thick; their depth can vary significantly, ranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters. The immense pressure exerted by this thick ice causes it to deform and flow, albeit at a painstakingly slow pace. The rate of movement can vary greatly depending on several factors, including the slope of the underlying bedrock, the ice temperature, and the presence of meltwater at the base of the glacier. Meltwater acts as a lubricant, reducing friction and accelerating the flow. Some glaciers, known as "surging glaciers," can experience periods of rapid acceleration, moving several meters per day.

Glaciers play a vital role in shaping the Earth's landscape, acting as powerful agents of erosion and deposition. As they move, they scour the bedrock beneath them, plucking away rocks and sediment and transporting them downstream. This process carves out valleys, sharpens mountain peaks, and creates distinctive U-shaped valleys, a telltale sign of past glacial activity. The debris carried by the glacier, known as moraine, is eventually deposited as the ice melts, forming ridges and mounds that mark the glacier's former extent. The melting of glaciers also contributes significantly to sea-level rise, posing a growing threat to coastal communities worldwide, and provides essential freshwater resources for many regions, supporting ecosystems and human populations. Studying glaciers is vital for understanding past climate changes and predicting future trends, allowing scientists to monitor their retreat and assess the impact on global water resources and sea levels.
