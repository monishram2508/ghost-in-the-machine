Now, pard, about this here pard business. It’s a thing you hear bandied about like a politician’s promises come election time. “Howdy, pard,” they’ll say, all smiles and sunshine, while their hand’s already halfway to your poke, figurin’ to relieve you of some dust faster than a sidewinder slithering through sand. Don't be fooled, son. "Pard" ain't always a term of endearment, more often it's just a lubricant, slicking up the gears of a swindle or softening the blow of a proposition that'll leave you poorer than a church mouse on Sunday. I recollect one fella, called himself "Whispering Willie," who addressed everyone as "pard," even the mules. That oughta told me somethin', but no, I was greener than a gourd vine. He sweet-talked me into investin' in a silver mine that turned out to be nothin' but a hole in the ground big enough to bury my hopes and my hard-earned dollars.

Then you get the genuine article, the fella who’ll share his last biscuit with you when your belly’s growlin' like a grizzly bear, the fella who’ll stand back-to-back with you when trouble comes a-callin’, even if you are uglier than sin and dumber than a box of rocks. Those pards, they’re scarcer than hen's teeth and worth more than all the silver in the Comstock Lode. I’ve had a few of that sort, praise be. Men who didn’t use the word lightly, men who understood that bein’ a pard means more than just spittin’ in the same direction. It means watchin' each other's backs, speakin' your mind even when it’s a prickly thing to do, and acceptin’ the other fella, warts and all. So, next time someone slaps you on the back and calls you “pard,” take a good long look at their eyes, and listen to the tone of their voice. Might just be a genuine offer of friendship, or it might be the preamble to a pickpocket’s symphony. Either way, keep your hand on your wallet, and your wits about you. Trust is a mighty fine thing, but in this here world, a touch of skepticism never hurt nobody.
