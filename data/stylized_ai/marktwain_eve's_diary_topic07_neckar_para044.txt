Ah, the Neckar! They call it a river, I suppose, which is technically accurate, seeing as it possesses water and a bed for that water to loll about in. But if you're expecting a grand, roaring spectacle akin to the Mississippi, prepare yourself for a gentle disappointment. The Neckar is more of a docile streamlet that's been puffed up with a touch of self-importance, convinced of its own significance merely because it meanders picturesquely through tidy German towns. It is, in essence, the very soul of respectable German orderliness, a watery embodiment of punctuality and a profound aversion to any sort of unruly behavior. Why, I wouldn't be surprised if it keeps a detailed schedule of its own ebb and flow, and docks itself a penalty for running late.

I've watched it ripple past Heidelberg Castle, a magnificent ruin, which I suspect the Neckar secretly envies for its sheer audaciousness in crumbling so dramatically. The river, you see, prefers to maintain a steadfast composure, not a single splash out of place. Barges laden with…well, I never quite managed to decipher what they were laden with, probably something incredibly practical and sensible like coal or perhaps precisely measured portions of sauerkraut – chug along its surface with the rhythmic solemnity of a Sunday church procession. And the swans! Good heavens, the swans! They glide with such haughty grace, they could curtsy more convincingly than most society ladies. They seem to believe they own the entire river, and judging by their imperious glares towards the pigeons on the bank, they likely do. But even they, I suspect, are secretly bored stiff, yearning for a good old-fashioned flood, just to ruffle their feathers and inject a little chaos into the proceedings. But alas, the Neckar, like a dutiful German hausfrau, remains stubbornly placid, ever the epitome of unexciting, yet utterly dependable, mediocrity. One can only admire its sheer tenacity in being so consistently…Neckar-ish.
