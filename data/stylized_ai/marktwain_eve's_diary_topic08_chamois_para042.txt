Now, about this chamois creature, a beast I’ve never laid eyes upon, truth be told, but have heard tell of from travelers and books that are, undoubtedly, embroidered with more fancy than fact. They say it’s a goat-antelope, which sounds like some sort of cruel experiment gone awry in a Swiss clockmaker’s workshop. A goat crossed with an antelope? Preposterous! One can just picture the bewildered expression of the antelope, or the general air of surly disapproval emanating from the goat. 

They live, these chamois, up in the Alps, clinging to precipices steeper than a church steeple. Why? One wonders if they haven't just had a falling out with societal norms. I suppose there’s some philosophical satisfaction to be found in staring down upon the world from a height that would give a buzzard the jitters. I imagine they are quite the melancholic lot, these chamois, forever looking down on us mere mortals scrambling about in the valleys. 

They're prized, I understand, for their leather, which is said to be softer than a politician's promise. It’s apparently used for polishing fine things, which strikes me as terribly ironic. Here you have a creature spending its days dodging avalanches and scaling rock faces, only to end up as a rag for cleaning spectacles. It’s enough to make a body question the fairness of the universe, and whether someone’s got a celestial thumb pressing down rather heavily on the scales. 

And those horns! Crooked little things they are, like a pair of commas perpetually questioning everything around them. Perhaps they're wondering, just as I am, why anyone would choose to live on a mountain made entirely of sharp bits, when there’s perfectly good meadowland available at the bottom. But, then again, as my dear Adam used to say, “There’s no accounting for taste, especially when it comes to goats with existential crises.”
