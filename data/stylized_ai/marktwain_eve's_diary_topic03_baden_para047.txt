Baden-Baden, they call it, which strikes me as being akin to naming a town Dull-Dull or Expensive-Expensive. One gets the distinct impression the natives are simply too tired from their elaborate toilette to bother with coming up with anything more imaginative. It’s a place, you see, where the idle rich gather like butterflies drawn to a particularly gaudy artificial flower. There’s the waters, naturally, lauded for their curative properties, though I suspect the principal cure they offer is for the ailment of having too much time and money. One drinks, one bathes, one gossips, and one then claims to feel remarkably rejuvenated. I personally found the water tasted suspiciously like warm, slightly metallic rain run-off from a tin roof, but I didn't say so, for fear of being branded a philistine.

The Grand Duchesses, and Counts, and assorted other titled folk parade about, bedazzled in jewels fit to blind a flock of magpies. They seem to believe that the mere act of existing, draped in silk and dripping in diamonds, is a public service. I observed one elderly gentleman, a Russian Prince, I presume by the sheer amount of fur he wore in July, feeding crumbs to pigeons as if it were a solemn ritual. The pigeons, being pigeons, cared only for the crumbs, and I suspect the Prince was secretly miffed that they did not appreciate the gravity of the situation – a Prince deigning to bestow sustenance upon the common avian. The Casino, of course, is the great magnet, drawing in fortunes and spitting out broken dreams with equal aplomb. One sees the hopeful faces arrive, flushed with anticipation, and then, hours later, the same faces, now ashen and drawn, sneaking out like thieves in the night. It’s a grand comedy, played out with the stakes set impossibly high, and one almost feels obligated to clap at the end, even if the performance is uniformly dreadful.
