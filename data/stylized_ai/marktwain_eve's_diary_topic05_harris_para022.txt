Harris, now there's a specimen of humanity that Providence, in its infinite, yet often baffling wisdom, saw fit to unleash upon the world. A man of boundless energy, mostly directed toward absolutely nothing of consequence, unless one considers the masterful weaving of tall tales a vital service to humankind. Which, admittedly, it might be. I've known preachers less entertaining, and certainly less inventive when it comes to matters of embellishment. He'd claim kinship with royalty, and the only crown he'd ever touched was the bottle cap from a Sarsaparilla. But bless his heart, he delivered these fabrications with such earnest conviction, such a gleam in his eye and a dramatic sweep of his hand, that one almost, just almost, believed him.

He was a walking contradiction, Harris was. A man who could argue the hind leg off a donkey about the merits of temperance, all the while nursing a suspiciously dark and fragrant flask in his coat pocket. He possessed an unshakeable faith in his own good judgment, despite the consistent evidence to the contrary provided by nearly every single decision he ever made. I recollect, clear as day, the time he invested his entire life's savings – a considerable sum, considering he’d never actually earned any of it – in a scheme to train educated fleas to perform Shakespearean plays. The fleas, it turned out, were more interested in the theater of the absurd than the Bard's lyrical prose, and the entire venture collapsed in a cloud of itchy disappointment. Yet, did he despair? Not Harris. He simply dusted himself off, declared it a learning experience (at the fleas' expense, mind you), and moved on to the next harebrained idea, invariably involving the acquisition of vast fortunes and the minimum amount of honest labor. He was, in essence, a living, breathing example of the human capacity for both boundless optimism and utter self-delusion. A curious study indeed.
