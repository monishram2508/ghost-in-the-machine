The PARD protein family, a collection of evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinases, plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining cell polarity, particularly in the context of epithelial cell development and neurogenesis. Across various organisms, from invertebrates like Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, PARD proteins orchestrate a complex interplay of signaling pathways to define the apical and basolateral domains of polarized cells. These domains, distinct in their protein and lipid composition, are essential for proper cell function, including nutrient absorption, waste excretion, and cell-cell communication. The founding member of this family, PARD-1 (also known as MARK in mammals), acts as a master regulator of cell polarity by phosphorylating downstream targets, thereby influencing their localization and activity.

Specifically, PARD proteins interact with other polarity determinants, such as the CRB (Crumbs), LGL (Lethal giant larvae), and SCRIBBLE complexes, to fine-tune the organization of the cytoskeleton and the trafficking of membrane proteins. For example, PARD-3 and PARD-6, in conjunction with atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), form a complex that segregates to the apical domain, preventing the formation of basolateral structures in this region. Conversely, LGL and SCRIBBLE proteins localize to the basolateral domain, inhibiting apical identity and ensuring proper compartmentalization. PARD-1/MARK often phosphorylates LGL, regulating its interaction with the cell membrane and ultimately contributing to the maintenance of basolateral identity.

Dysregulation of PARD signaling has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, including cancer. Aberrant expression or mutations in PARD genes can disrupt cell polarity, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation, migration, and invasion – hallmarks of tumor development and metastasis. In particular, the loss of apical-basal polarity, often associated with PARD dysregulation, allows epithelial cells to detach from their surrounding tissues and invade adjacent areas, contributing to tumor progression. Furthermore, PARD proteins are crucial for neuronal development, guiding axon formation and dendrite branching. Disruptions in PARD signaling during neurogenesis can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairments. The complex and multifaceted roles of PARD proteins make them attractive targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring cell polarity and combating diseases associated with its disruption.
