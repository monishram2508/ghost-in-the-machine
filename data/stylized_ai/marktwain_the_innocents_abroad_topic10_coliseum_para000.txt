Now, this Coliseum, mind you, is a sight, though perhaps a bit overrated by your excitable tourist, the kind who thinks anything old must necessarily be grand. It's certainly large, I’ll grant you that, big enough to hold half of Rome, plus their donkeys and stray dogs, though I doubt they ever let the dogs in, not with the lions already providing the entertainment. One imagines the planning meetings: "Right, let's build a thing so big it can be seen from the moon! And then we'll fill it with screaming Romans and hungry beasts. Good show, chaps!" And good show it was, for the spectators at least. For the Christians and gladiators? Well, that’s a different matter entirely. Likely as entertaining for the lions as it was terrifying for the aforementioned Christians.

They say the sands of the arena drank up enough blood to float a battleship. Exaggeration, of course. I daresay the Tiber itself has seen more than its fair share of crimson tides. Still, it paints a picture, doesn't it? A rather lurid one, I admit, but these Romans, they weren’t exactly shrinking violets. They liked a bit of blood and thunder, and the Coliseum was just the place to get it. Imagine the scene: emperors thumbing up or down with the fickle grace of a weather vane in a hurricane; senators puffing themselves up like pigeons, pretending they weren’t secretly placing bets; and the common rabble, hollering for more blood, bless their simple hearts. And now it's just tourists, snapping pictures of the ruins as if they were posing with a particularly large pile of rocks, utterly oblivious to the ghosts screaming silently into the ages. Ah, progress, I suppose. From bloodsport to selfie stick, quite a transition. One wonders what the lions would make of it all. I suspect a well-aimed swipe at a selfie stick would have been considered a rather sporting gesture in their day.
