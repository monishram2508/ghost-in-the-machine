Morgan, now there was a specimen! Found him kicking around Virginia City, looking for all the world like a stray dog who’d swallowed a dictionary and hadn’t quite digested it. He claimed to be a prospector, naturally, every scalawag this side of the Mississippi claimed to be a prospector, even the ones who couldn't tell quartz from a turnip. Morgan, though, he’d read books, that much was plain. He could quote Shakespeare one minute and then complain the next about the price of beans at O’Riley’s Emporium. Quite the card, that one. He never did find gold, mind you. Spent most of his time chasing rainbows and lecturing mules on the finer points of Greek philosophy, which, as you can imagine, went over like a skunk at a church social. 

He had a theory, Morgan did, that the mountains were whispering secrets only he could hear. The rest of us just heard the wind, mostly, and the occasional coyote serenading the moon. But Morgan, he insisted the mountains were offering him clues to a lost Mother Lode, hidden away by Spanish conquistadors who'd probably gotten lost themselves and died of scurvy. He even drew maps, elaborate affairs filled with fantastical beasts and Latin phrases that would make a priest blush. Said he deciphered them from the patterns in the sagebrush. Sagebrush! As if the Almighty would entrust the location of untold riches to a weed best suited for flavoring rabbit stew. Still, you couldn't help but like the fella. He was so earnestly convinced of his own brand of lunacy, it was almost contagious. Almost. The town certainly got its entertainment value out of him, though whether it was worth the price of his bean consumption is a matter for the historians.
