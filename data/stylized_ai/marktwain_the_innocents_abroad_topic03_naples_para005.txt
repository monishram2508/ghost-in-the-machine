Ah, Naples! A city, I say, that would make even the patron saint of pickpockets blush. One arrives expecting sunshine and song, and, to be sure, finds plenty of both, liberally seasoned with a dollop of chaos the likes of which would make a New York traffic jam look like a well-ordered church procession. I’ve seen more carts careening down those narrow streets than I’ve seen sermons in a decade, and I daresay the carts were driven with more fervor. The buildings, bless their crumbling hearts, lean against each other for support like a gaggle of old gossips, each whispering secrets of centuries gone by. Laundry hangs like defiant flags from every window, a kaleidoscope of mismatched stockings and unmentionables that lend the city an air of perpetually airing its dirty linen in public, which, come to think of it, is rather apt.

The Neapolitans themselves, well, they're a breed apart. Loud, passionate, and possessing a talent for gesticulation that would put a symphony conductor to shame. They haggle over the price of a lemon with the tenacity of a terrier after a rat, and then turn around and give half of it away to a beggar with a theatrical flourish. And the noise! A symphony of shouting vendors, honking carriages, and the incessant chatter of a thousand conversations all vying for dominance. One can scarcely hear oneself think, which, I suspect, is the point. Thinking, after all, might lead one to question the sheer glorious absurdity of it all. The food, however, is another matter entirely. One could forgive Naples any sin, any transgression, for a single bite of its pizza. A simple creation of dough, tomato, and cheese, yet elevated to a culinary masterpiece. It’s enough to make one forget the near-constant threat of being run over by a scooter and to declare, in that very moment, that life, despite its inherent follies, is undeniably good. And then, of course, one remembers the leaning buildings, the laundry, and the pickpockets, and one realizes that Naples, in its own peculiar way, is a most excellent cautionary tale. A reminder that even in the midst of delightful chaos, one ought to keep a firm grip on one's wallet.
