Ballou, now there’s a specimen for the naturalist’s cabinet, a curiosity fit to stand beside the petrified man and the jumping frog of Calaveras County. A more innocent and unsuspecting tenderfoot I never did clap eyes on, and I’ve seen stagecoachloads fresh off the boat, ripe for fleecing. This Ballou hailed from some green and godforsaken corner of the East, where they likely used buttercups for currency and considered a rattlesnake a formidable house pet. He arrived in Nevada, bless his heart, with the naïve assumption that gold grew on trees, or at least could be coaxed out of the earth with a charming smile and a polite request. 

He’d brought along a library of etiquette books, presumably to educate the coyotes on proper dining protocols. Picture him, if you will, perched precariously on a claim, attempting to read “Debrett’s Peerage” while simultaneously swatting away mosquitoes the size of hummingbirds. He’d address the miners with a courtly bow, offering them advice on the finer points of conversation, which, naturally, fell upon deaf ears. They were far more interested in whether his claim showed any promise of yielding enough dust to buy a bottle of whiskey, or maybe two, depending on the quality.

He took to mining with the same enthusiasm one might approach dental surgery without anesthetic. I recollect him once trying to blast a stubborn rock with dynamite. He’d read the instructions, mind you, meticulously, but clearly overlooked the crucial step involving getting out of the vicinity before the explosion. He emerged from the smoke cloud looking like a chimney sweep who’d lost a wrestling match with a badger. Covered head-to-toe in soot, only his spectacles remained gleaming, peering out with that same bewildered innocence. He even tried to teach his mule, Penelope, to perform parlor tricks, which resulted only in Penelope developing a fondness for chewing on his frock coat and a complete disregard for the Queen’s English, which Ballou, in his infinite patience, attempted to instill in her. The man was a walking, talking, breathing illustration of the adage that ignorance is bliss, though I suspect even bliss had its limits when confronted with the sheer, unadulterated Ballou-ness of the man. He was, in short, an accident waiting to happen, a human tumbleweed drifting through the rough and tumble landscape of the Nevada Territory.
