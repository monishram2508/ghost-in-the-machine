Brigham, that solemn old coot, was quite the spectacle out there in the desert. A man of God, they called him, though he reminded me more of a shrewd banker counting gold nuggets in a darkened tent. He held the reins of that Mormon empire tighter than a drunk prospector clings to a bottle of whiskey on a Saturday night. Salt Lake City, you see, was his chessboard, and the good folks there were the pawns he moved about with nary a blink of an eye. A man of visions, they said, and maybe he was, for I’ll be hanged if I could fathom the logic behind half the rules he laid down.

One had to admire his grit, though. Driving a whole flock of folks across that unforgiving landscape – that was no Sunday picnic. It took a will sharper than a rusty Bowie knife and a tongue smoother than a greased pig. And that man possessed both in spades. He could preach fire and brimstone one minute, then charm a widow out of her last cow the next. He was a walking paradox, that Brigham. A blend of pious pronouncements and hard-headed pragmatism, seasoned with a dash of frontier cunning.

He had this way of staring that’d make you feel like you were squirming under a magnifying glass on a hot summer day. You never quite knew if he was judging your soul or just calculating how many bricks you could lay in a day. Some folks claimed he had a direct line to the Almighty. Others whispered that his real power came from a secret stash of prime real estate and a well-managed printing press. Whatever the truth, Brigham was a force of nature out there in the wilderness, a human dam holding back the tide of chaos. And Lord knows, there was plenty of chaos to go around.
