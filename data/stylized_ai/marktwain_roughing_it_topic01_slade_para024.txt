Slade, now there was a town, or at least a collection of saloons and shacks pretending to be one. I reckon the devil himself drew up the blueprints for that place, using brimstone for ink and a shot of rotgut for inspiration. One arrived there, weary from the coach and smelling worse than a month-old skunk, and the first thing to greet ye was a blast of noise that could curdle milk at fifty paces. Pistols barkin', fiddles sawin' away like they were tryin' to escape the tune, and the general uproar of fellas arguin' over cards, women, or which brand of whiskey could peel paint faster. 

The buildings, Lord love 'em, looked like they'd been built by a blind man using a toothpick and a prayer. Half of 'em were leanin' further than a politician in a scandal, and the other half threatened to collapse at the slightest breeze. I saw one dog there, a mangy cur with more ribs than meat, that looked like it was actively tryin' to outrun its own shadow – and failing. And the dust? Well, you could write your name in it six inches deep, and it tasted remarkably like gunpowder mixed with broken dreams.

But mind you, Slade wasn’t without its charms, such as they were. The fellas who frequented the establishments there had a certain… directness about them. You always knew where you stood, which was generally in the way of a flying fist or a stray bullet. And the ladies! Bless their hearts, they were as tough as nails and twice as sharp. They could fleece a gambler cleaner than a sheared sheep and then outdrink him under the table. I recall one time I saw a gal, barely five foot nothin', who could handle a six-shooter faster than a hummingbird could flap its wings. All in all, Slade was the kind of place that made you thankful for the smaller mercies in life, like havin' all your teeth or a roof that didn't leak directly onto your face while you slept. You wouldn't want to settle down there, mind you, but it certainly made for a memorable…experience. You'd be hard-pressed to find a place more lively, albeit deadly lively, than that hive of activity.
