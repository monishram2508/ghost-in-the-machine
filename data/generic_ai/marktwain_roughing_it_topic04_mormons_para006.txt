The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormonism, emerged in the early 19th century in the United States through the teachings of Joseph Smith. Smith claimed to have received divine visitations, including the discovery of golden plates inscribed with ancient scripture. These plates, purportedly translated by Smith through divine power, formed the basis of the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible by members of the church. A central tenet of Mormon belief is the restoration of the true church of Jesus Christ, which they believe was lost after the death of the original apostles. This restoration, according to Mormon theology, occurred through Smith, who received priesthood authority directly from heavenly messengers.

Historically, Mormonism has faced considerable controversy and persecution. Early followers were driven from several states due to their religious beliefs and practices, including the now-abandoned practice of polygamy. While officially renounced in 1890, the legacy of polygamy continues to be a sensitive topic, often fueling misconceptions about the faith. The church is structured hierarchically, with lay members participating in various roles, including local leadership and missionary work. Missionary service, typically undertaken by young adults, plays a vital role in spreading the church’s message globally.

Today, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a global religion with millions of members worldwide. It emphasizes strong family values, community involvement, and a commitment to living a moral and righteous life. Members adhere to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. Tithing, the donation of ten percent of one's income, is also a key practice, used to fund church operations, temples, and charitable endeavors. While some aspects of Mormon theology and historical narratives differ significantly from mainstream Christian beliefs, Latter-day Saints consider themselves Christians, emphasizing their faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior and Redeemer.
