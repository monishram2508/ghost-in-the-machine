Slade, now that was a town. More of a grease stain on the grand Nevada landscape, really, but a town nonetheless. Population, if you could call those grizzled prospectors and saloon keepers a population, hovered somewhere between "a handful" and "a plague of locusts," depending on whether you were asking the county assessor or the fellow who just lost his shirt at the faro table. I reckoned I hadn't seen so many men who looked like they'd been chewed up and spat out by a badger since I left St. Louis. There weren't any trees, naturally, unless you counted the stunted sagebrush that clung to the hills like a miser to his gold. Water, ah, water was scarcer than hen's teeth, and twice as valuable. They say a man could get murdered for a canteen full, though I suspect a decent bottle of whiskey would fetch a better price. 

The main street, if you could call a rutted dirt track a "street," boasted two saloons, a livery stable overflowing with more flies than horses, and a general store that looked like it was constructed out of old dreams and borrowed planks. The wind howled through that place like a banshee with a toothache, carrying with it the scent of dust, stale beer, and unwashed humanity. Every building leaned at a drunken angle, as if the whole town was about to tip over and spill its contents into the desert. And the people! Lord have mercy, the people. They squinted, they chewed, they spat, and they looked at you like you owed them money. I saw a dog fight over a bone one afternoon that was more civil than most conversations I overheard in the saloons. They were all there, the gamblers, the con men, the dreamers, the desperados – all drawn to that dusty little patch of nowhere by the allure of silver, or the lack of options back east. I tell you, a man could make a fortune in Slade, if he could just figure out how to sell air conditioning in hell.
