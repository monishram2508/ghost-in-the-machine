Higbie, now there’s a specimen. A feller could study him for a month and still be scratching his head trying to figure out what makes the critter tick. Claimed to be a mining expert, Higbie did, but I reckon a blind mole could find ore quicker. He was all bluster and pronouncements, full of hot air enough to power a Mississippi steamboat, always ready with an opinion on everything from the price of beans to the political machinations in Washington, and usually wrong on both counts. And honest? Well, Higbie's honesty was like a mirage shimmering on the desert floor – looked promising from a distance, but disappear when you got close.

He was a walking contradiction, Higbie was. A man who could spend a week prospecting for gold, suffering blisters and sunstroke, only to blow the meager pickings he'd acquired on a single hand of poker down at the saloon. He'd wear the same tattered coat for months, but always sported a flamboyant neckerchief, claiming it warded off the evil eye, though I suspect it was mostly to draw attention to himself. And he was a storyteller, Lord, could that man spin a yarn! Each tale grew taller and more improbable with every telling, featuring himself as the hero, naturally, facing down grizzly bears and outsmarting claim jumpers. Whether there was a grain of truth to any of it, well, that's a question best left to the philosophers down at the university, the kind who spend more time theorizing than living. Truth be told, despite his flaws and foibles, Higbie had a certain charm about him. A rascal, yes, but a lovable rascal. He had a way of making you laugh, even when he was swindling you blind. And in a land as harsh and unforgiving as Nevada, a little laughter was worth its weight in gold, maybe even more than Higbie could ever find. He was a fixture in those parts, like the sagebrush and the tumbleweeds, a permanent part of the scenery, and the landscape wouldn't be the same without him, the ornery old cuss.
