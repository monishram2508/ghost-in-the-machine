Now, a sepulchre, you see, is just a fancy, highfalutin word for a tomb. Not your common, garden-variety grave where folks are just tossed in with a hymn and a handful of dirt. No, sir. A sepulchre is for folks who think they're a cut above the rest, even in death. It's got to have carvings, and maybe a statue or two of the deceased looking noble – which, if you knew him when he was alive, was probably a considerable stretch of the truth. Likely had the sculptor flattering him up a good bit, smoothing out those wrinkles and adding a touch of righteousness to his jowls. 

I reckon the appeal is wanting to leave behind a lasting impression, proving you weren't just another tumbleweed rolling through life. As if a pile of stone can change what folks really thought of you when you were around. Still, you can't blame them, can you? We all want to be remembered for something, even if it's for having the biggest, gaudiest box in the graveyard. Funny thing is, though, the longer that sepulchre sits there, the more it just becomes another weathered rock. The inscriptions fade, the moss grows over the fancy carvings, and before you know it, some adventurous young’un is using it as a base for hide-and-seek. 

And those grand intentions? All gone to pot. Turns out, time has a way of leveling the playing field, sepulchre or no sepulchre. It makes you wonder if the deceased, assuming he can see all this from wherever he landed, isn't having a good chuckle at his own expense. Maybe he's thinking, "Well, ain't that a fine how-do-you-do? All that money wasted on a glorified pigeon roost." You know, I always figured a good, plain pine box was good enough. Save the money for a decent whiskey, that's my motto. At least *that* would be put to good use, and probably remembered a sight longer than any tombstone.
