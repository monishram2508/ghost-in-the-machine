Damascus, ah, that venerable old humbug of a city! Why, they say it's the oldest inhabited city in the world, though I wouldn't wager my best cigar on it. These old cities, you see, are like old men: full of tall tales and short on verifiable facts. Still, there's a certain charm in the pretense, a delightful bit of theatrics played out on a grand, dusty stage. I wandered through its narrow alleys, dodging donkeys and inhaling the aroma of spices so potent they could knock a lesser man clean off his feet. One feels positively swaddled in history, though I suspect half of it was fabricated to impress gullible tourists like myself. The locals, bless their entrepreneurial hearts, will swear on a stack of Korans that every stone whispers secrets of Saladin and that the very dust beneath your boots is composed of the pulverized bones of Roman legions. I half expected to trip over Cleopatra's asp myself, though my companion, a fellow traveler with a penchant for historical accuracy (a most unfortunate trait, I assure you), pooh-poohed the notion. 

The souks, or marketplaces, are a glorious riot of color and chaos, a perfect testament to the human capacity for haggling. One can purchase anything from a rusty nail to a genuine, certified (by a gentleman who looked suspiciously like he'd slept under a camel) antique sword. I, of course, acquired the latter, after engaging in a spirited debate with the merchant that involved much arm-waving, theatrical sighs, and the eventual threat of summoning the American Consul. I suspect the sword was no more antique than my own dentures, but it makes a fine conversation piece nonetheless. And the food, good heavens, the food! Enough lamb kebabs to build a small fortress, mountains of hummus smoother than a politician's promises, and sweets so cloying they threaten to glue your teeth together permanently. One leaves Damascus feeling thoroughly stuffed, both with dates and with dubious historical anecdotes, ready to regale acquaintances with tales of ancient glory, embellished, of course, with a healthy dose of American exaggeration. It's a city that leaves you smelling of incense, feeling slightly poorer, and convinced you've seen the very cradle of civilization, even if it's just a very cleverly constructed imitation.
