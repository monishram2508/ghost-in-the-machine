Now, a sepulchre, you understand, is not your common, everyday dirt nap. No, sir. That’s a graveyard, and graveyards are like barbershops – plentiful, and offering a service most folks eventually avail themselves of. A sepulchre, though, that's something altogether different. It's a residence, built for the long haul, a veritable mansion in the underworld. Think of it as the Ritz-Carlton of the afterlife, only with significantly less room service and a clientele that is decidedly less lively. They don't call for bellhops, mind you.

I saw one once, down in Egypt, dug into the very heart of a pyramid. Must have cost a king's ransom, and likely a king's life as well, given the work conditions. The fellow who owned it, a Pharaoh of some importance if the hieroglyphics were to be believed, had spared no expense. Gold leaf thicker than a gambler's excuses, alabaster smoother than a politician's promises, and enough statues to populate a small town, all designed to keep him company in his eternal slumber. Of course, all that wealth didn’t seem to prevent the little tomb robbers from making a dent in the merchandise over the centuries, a testament to the universal truth that even the afterlife can't escape a good sale, or in this case, a good pilfering.

The amusing thing is, here was this fella, king in life, catered to hand and foot, building himself the ultimate retirement home, and for what? To lay there, mummified and motionless, while tourists snap pictures of his underwear – linen underwear, I might add, finer than anything I’ve got. It's enough to make a man question the value of ambition, isn't it? I wager that Pharaoh never thought he’d become a sideshow attraction, a historical oddity viewed through a glass case. Goes to show, even death can’t protect you from a clever marketing strategy. They even sell miniature replicas now, I heard, you can have your own little pharaoh at home. The irony of it all is thicker than the desert dust, I swear. You spend your life accruing treasures, only to become one yourself.
