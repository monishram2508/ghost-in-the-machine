Carson, Nevada, the state's unassuming capital, presents a unique blend of historical charm and modern development nestled in the shadow of the Sierra Nevada.

The V&T Railway, meticulously restored, offers scenic rides through the rugged landscape, providing a glimpse into the past when the railway transported ore and passengers during the silver boom.
