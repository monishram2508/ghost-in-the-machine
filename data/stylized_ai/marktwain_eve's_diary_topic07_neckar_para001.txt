The Neckar, bless its meandering heart, is what you might call a river of modest ambition. It’s no Mississippi, booming with the grand pronouncements of steamboats and the secrets whispered by muddy banks. No, the Neckar is content to ripple along, a silver ribbon draped across the Swabian countryside like a slightly askew shawl. It pretends to be important, mind you, with its barges lumbering along laden with what I assume are goods of tremendous value, though to my untrained eye they appear to be mostly gravel and the occasional disgruntled-looking cow. One half expects the cattle to let out a mournful moo like a steamboat whistle. One almost wishes they would, as that might relieve the tedium of watching them. 

The towns clinging to its edges, Heidelberg the most brazen of the lot, are all determined to convince you that their reflections in the water are the very pinnacle of picturesque charm. And, well, some of them manage a decent imitation. Heidelberg, with its castle perched precariously above like a tipsy gentleman clinging to a balcony, certainly has a certain… *something*. A certain knack for attracting tourists armed with cameras and a disconcerting fondness for bratwurst, perhaps. The Neckar, you see, allows this to happen, it provides the reflective surface, the watery stage upon which these little dramas of German life play out. It’s like a patient old aunt, tolerating the antics of her over-enthusiastic nieces and nephews, occasionally murmuring a gentle “Shhh” when the revelry gets a bit too loud. It hasn’t the energy to complain much, and honestly, neither have I. After all, it is quite peaceful sitting here, watching the Neckar nudge along, carrying its burdens and its reflections, content in its quiet, un-spectacular way. One could almost call it… agreeable. But let's not get carried away.
