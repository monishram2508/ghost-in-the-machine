Now, pardners, about these here pardnerships, or "pards," as some folks call 'em. They're a funny critter, a regular chimera of human interaction, if you ask me. You see a fella, maybe lookin' a bit lonesome chew'n on a hunk of bacon and beans by the campfire, and you think, "Well, might as well throw my lot in with that one. Two hands is better'n one, especially when it comes to siftin' through tailings for gold." That's the theory, anyhow. In practice, it often amounts to two fellows arguin' over which way the creek flows, or whether a particularly promising-lookin' rock is fool's gold or the real McCoy.

I recall one time, me and a fella named "Shorty" Henderson, on account of his stature, naturally, decided to team up. Shorty, bless his soul, had the vision of a bat in a coal mine and the work ethic of a hibernating bear, but he could tell a rattlesnake from a garter snake, which, out here, is a skill that outweighs a whole heap of other shortcomings. We agreed, fair and square, to split the profits fifty-fifty. What we didn't agree on was who did which chore. Shorty reckoned his talent for snake identification exempted him from anything involving a pickaxe, while I, naturally, thought the same logic applied to my uncanny ability to brew coffee that could stand a spoon straight up.

The upshot was, we spent more time disputin' than diggin', and by the time we finally hit a vein, it was barely worth the powder to blow it out. We did manage to scrape together enough to buy a round of drinks at the saloon, though, which, come to think of it, might have been the whole point of the enterprise in the first place. Point being, a pardnership ain't always about gold or silver, sometimes it's just about havin' someone to argue with besides your own reflection in a muddy puddle. And sometimes, that's worth more than all the nuggets in California. Just don't expect it to make you rich, unless rich in the currency of tall tales and shared misery counts.
