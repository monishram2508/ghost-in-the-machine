Now, this "bucksheesh," as the Orientals call it, is a curious institution, and one that colors the whole Eastern experience like a gaudy, unreliable dye. It ain't your simple, straightforward tip, mind you, like one might leave for a weary waiter who braved a blizzard to bring you a lukewarm mutton chop. Nay, bucksheesh is far more...fluid, shall we say? More pervasive, like the dust that coats everything from the pyramids to the whiskers of the humblest donkey. It's a lubricant, a key, a whispered password to unlock all manner of doors, both real and figurative. Want your luggage to miraculously appear at the front of the camel train? Bucksheesh. Need a particularly choice spot to observe the whirling dervishes? Bucksheesh. Desire the local rug merchant to suddenly "discover" a priceless antique buried deep in the recesses of his dusty shop? Well, I reckon you know the answer.

The beauty, or perhaps the absurdity, lies in its omnipresence. You can’t escape it, try as you might. One attempts to navigate the teeming bazaar with a noble, upright intention, to bargain fairly and honestly, only to find oneself entangled in a web of outstretched palms, each murmuring the magic word with varying degrees of insistence. Even the fellow sweeping the dust from your path expects a little something, as if the very act of preventing you from tripping over a stray date pit were an act of heroic proportions. And the children, bless their innocent little souls, are the most shameless practitioners of all. They’ll follow you for blocks, chanting “bucksheesh, bucksheesh,” until you’re ready to trade your prized pocket watch just for a moment of blessed silence. It’s a wonder, truly, that the entire region doesn’t sink beneath the weight of all the coins being exchanged. But somehow, it all works, after a fashion. It keeps the wheels turning, the tea brewing, and the palms perpetually open, a constant reminder that in the East, a little something for everyone goes a long, long way. Just be sure to keep a full pouch, friend, lest you find yourself stranded in the desert with naught but sand and a profound, and rather expensive, lesson in local customs.
