Now, about this Morgan, mind you, a fellow who’d likely make a parson blush with the stories he carried ‘round in that thick skull of his. Claimed he was a prospector, though I suspicioned he'd spent more time prospectin' saloons than actual mines. Dressed like he'd been attacked by a badger wearing a feed sack, all patched denim and a hat that looked like it had lost a fight with a threshing machine. Said he’d made a fortune in the Comstock, naturally, but when pressed, the details were as slippery as a greased pig at a county fair. Seems his "fortune" consisted of a few glittering flecks in a pan and a grand story to tell the greenhorns.

He possessed the kind of confidence that only comes from either immense wealth or a complete lack of sense, and I reckon it was the latter with Morgan. He’d hold court at the Golden Gulch Saloon, spinning yarns about mountains of silver and veins of gold thicker than your arm, all while nursing a whiskey that probably cost him his last dime. He was a walking, talking advertisement for the dangers of believing everything you hear in a mining camp, yet folks seemed drawn to him like moths to a flickering lamp. Maybe it was the sheer audacity of his lies, or perhaps it was the faint glimmer of hope he offered in a land where hope was rarer than hen's teeth. Whatever it was, Morgan was a fixture, a character, a good-for-nothin' who somehow managed to be both irritating and oddly charming at the same time. I wagered he’d die penniless, buried beneath a rockslide chasing some fool's gold dream, but even then, he’d probably manage to convince Saint Peter that he deserved a prime piece of real estate in heaven, right next to the pearly gates, naturally.
