Well, Carson City, bless its heart, wasn't much to look at then, and I reckon it ain't got no younger since. A scattering of shacks and saloons, like someone flung a handful of dice and built a town where they landed, more or less. It clung to the foot of those sere, unforgiving mountains like a burr to a blanket, determined not to be shaken off. The dust, now that was a permanent fixture, a free-floating haze that seasoned your supper and painted your lungs the color of a well-worn saddle. You could write your name in it on the table, and probably plant potatoes if you watered it right. The citizens, a motley crew collected from the four corners of the earth—and a few corners I suspect came straight from the infernal regions—were all looking for that lucky strike, that vein of silver that would turn them from humble prospectors to highfalutin nabobs overnight. They talked loud, walked proud, and drank harder, each one convinced he was only a shovel's worth of dirt away from riches. You'd hear more lies told in an hour in a Carson City saloon than you would hear in a lifetime back East, and most of 'em were about how close someone was to striking it rich. The architecture, if you could call it that, was strictly utilitarian: build it quick, build it cheap, and hope it lasts until you sell out and move on. And the wind, oh, the wind! It howled down those mountain canyons like a banshee with a toothache, rattling the windows and stripping the paint from whatever unfortunate structure dared to stand in its way. But despite all its shortcomings, or maybe because of 'em, there was a certain charm to Carson, a raw, untamed spirit that clung to the place like that persistent dust. It was a place where a man could be anybody he wanted, even if that anybody was a liar, a drunkard, or a dreamer. And Lord knows, there were plenty of all three to go around.
