Zermatt, bless its heart, is perched upon a precipice of the Alps, a little village that appears to have been accidentally dropped from the heavens and stuck there by a particularly stubborn glacier. One approaches it with a certain amount of trepidation, for the modern contraption of the motor-car is forbidden, a decree enforced, I suspect, by a secret society of goats with a vested interest in the maintenance of the local hay-fueled economy. Thus, one must arrive by train, a clattering, puffing beast of iron that seems perpetually surprised to find itself so high up in the world. Once disembarked, the place unfolds with a quaint, almost theatrical, charm. Little electric buggies, like overgrown children’s toys, whiz about, carrying tourists burdened with more luggage than common sense would dictate. The hotels, grand affairs with gingerbread trim and names that suggest a Habsburg residence, huddle together as if sharing secrets about the latest snowfall.

The matterhorn, of course, dominates the scenery, a jagged fang thrust into the cerulean sky. The locals, bless their industrious souls, have turned it into a veritable cottage industry. One can purchase postcards depicting it in every conceivable light, carve miniature Matterhorns from questionable wood, or even consume it in chocolate form, though I suspect the original is considerably less digestible. The air, thin enough to induce poetic delirium, is filled with the sound of cowbells and the breathless pronouncements of alpinists boasting of their latest conquest, conquests that usually involve considerable expense and an alarming lack of oxygen. One half expects Heidi to come bounding down the slopes, pursued by a particularly persistent St. Bernard bearing a barrel of something stronger than milk, though I suspect that is more wishful thinking on my part than a genuine expectation. All in all, Zermatt is a delightful, if somewhat expensive, escape from the humdrum of the everyday, a place where the scenery is breathtaking and the prices are equally so, a testament to man's enduring ability to capitalize on the natural world, and a reminder that even the most picturesque of places can be improved by a decent cup of coffee and a slightly less harrowing descent.
