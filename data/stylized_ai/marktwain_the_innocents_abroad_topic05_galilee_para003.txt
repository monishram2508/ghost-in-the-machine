Galilee, bless her simple heart, is not what you'd call a show-off. Jerusalem, now there's a city that likes to flaunt, all gold and history and holy hubbub. But Galilee? She's more like that quiet cousin who works the land, content with her lot, though you suspect she’s seen things that would curdle the milk of the most pious Jerusalemite. The Sea of Galilee, or Lake Gennesaret as some fancy it up, is a fine enough puddle, mind you, shimmering and sparkling like a new penny in the sun. Fishermen still cast their nets, though I dare say they’re mostly catching tourists these days, eager to sample the 'Saint Peter's fish' which, if I'm being honest, tastes suspiciously like any other fish plucked from a lake. Tiberias, clinging to its shores, is a town that's seen better centuries, a bit like a dowager queen, still wearing her faded finery and reminiscing about past glories.

The hills, though, are something to behold. Rolling green waves, they are, dotted with olive groves that look older than Methuselah and villages that seem to have slumbered since the days of Noah himself. You can wander through these hills, breathing in air so fresh it feels like a tonic, and almost imagine you hear the echo of sermons on the mount or the rustle of sandals hurrying to witness a miracle. Almost, mind you. More likely you'll hear the bleating of goats and the distant roar of a tour bus engine, bringing in a fresh batch of pilgrims eager to be enlightened, or at least purchase a few holy trinkets. Don't go expecting dazzling palaces or breathtaking architecture. Galilee is more about the subtle beauty, the unpretentious charm of a place that's been witness to so much and yet remains, stubbornly and endearingly, just Galilee. A place where you can ponder profound truths while swatting at flies and wondering if that fig tree really *is* the one. And after you get tired of pondering and swatting, there's always the fish.
