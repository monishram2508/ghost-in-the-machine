Well, now, a portiere, you say? It's a drapery, a curtain, a blamed big fancy rag, really, that folks hang in doorways 'stead of a proper door. Seems a bit daft when you think about it. Like tryin' to build a house outta spiderwebs and expectin' it to keep out the wind. I reckon Eve would've used one in the Garden of Eden, had they invented them then. Probably made out of fig leaves, cleverly stitched together. It'd been a sight more useful than some of those flimsy things you see today. Keeps out about as much drafts as a politician keeps promises. But then again, a door is such a definite thing, ain't it? Shuts you in, shuts you out. A portiere, now, that’s different. It’s suggestive. Mysterious, almost. You can peek around the edge, slip through unnoticed, pretend you ain’t really entering the room at all, just explorin’ a bit of draped fabric. Women, bless their hearts, they like that sort of thing. It adds a certain…je ne sais quoi, as the Frenchies say, even if they haven't got a clue what that 'quoi' truly is. Perhaps it's the promise of secrets, or the illusion of grandeur. Or perhaps it's just a way to keep the dust bunnies from rollin' out of the parlor and into the hallway. Whatever the reason, these portieres are here to stay, I imagine. Civilization progresses at a snail's pace, you see. We still use forks when fingers would do the job just as well, don't we? So a flimsy curtain in a doorway? Makes as much sense as most things, I suppose. And at least it’s something to hide behind when you're eavesdropping on the neighbors' conversation. Now *that's* what I call a real convenience.
