Now, Morgan, that fella was a study in contradictions, a regular human paradox wrapped in a dusty overcoat and a perpetual squint. Claimed he was a prospector, though I reckon he was more of a prospector of opportunities, sniffing out get-rich-quick schemes like a bloodhound after a ham bone. Lord knows what he actually *did* out in them hills besides stir up dust and chase jackrabbits – never saw him strike it rich, never saw him even strike it mediocre, come to think of it. He'd boast of veins of silver thicker than a wagon wheel, but somehow, he was always borrowing enough for beans and bacon from whoever was gullible enough to listen to his tall tales. And listen they did, bless their simple hearts. Morgan had a way with words, a silver tongue gilded with fool’s gold, that could convince a mule to trade places with a congressman. 

He was a walking encyclopedia of improbable anecdotes, each one more outlandish than the last. Why, he once swore he'd outsmarted a grizzly bear in a poker game, using a deck made from dried sagebrush leaves. Said the bear folded on a full house – claimed it couldn't read the pips, the poor dimwit. Truth be told, Morgan probably couldn’t read the pips either, but he had a certain *style* of bluffing that could intimidate even the most seasoned gambler, or in this case, a bear with a penchant for high stakes. And his clothing – well, it looked like it had been through a war, and lost badly. Patches upon patches, held together by hopes and dreams and maybe a stray safety pin or two. One leg of his trousers always seemed shorter than the other, giving him a peculiar, lopsided gait that suggested he’d spent his youth dodging bullets, or maybe just avoiding paying his bar tab. Despite his obvious lack of success and questionable grooming, Morgan possessed a certain undeniable charm. He was a scoundrel, no doubt, but a lovable scoundrel, the kind you’d gladly share a campfire with, even if you kept a close eye on your wallet.
