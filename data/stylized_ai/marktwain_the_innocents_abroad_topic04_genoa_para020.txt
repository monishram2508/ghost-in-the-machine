Genoa, they call it "La Superba," which being translated, I reckon means "The Stuck-Up One." Now, that ain’t altogether wrong, mind you. She sits perched upon the Ligurian coast like a haughty dowager, all crumbling grandeur and faded finery. The harbor, a chaotic jumble of fishing boats, steamers puffing importantly, and yachts gleaming like so many dandies at a ball, all vying for attention like children pulling at their mother's skirt. Narrow streets, or *caruggi* as they’re so eloquently termed, snake and twist like a nervous politician trying to avoid a direct answer. They are so close together you could practically lean out of your window and pinch the baker’s rolls, assuming you possess the inclination and the reach. I say, a fellow could get lost in them for days, though whether that would be a misfortune or a delightful escape, I leave to the individual.

The Genoese themselves, well, they’re a curious breed. They seem to conduct their business with a grim determination, like they are engaged in a perpetual feud with their bank accounts, which, knowing bankers, they might be right. They hoard their precious pesto with the fervor of a miser guarding his gold, and should you dare suggest adding cream to it, be prepared for a lecture that could peel paint. But then, just when you think you have them figured out, they’ll surprise you with a wink and a story about the city's glorious past when they practically owned the Mediterranean, which by the telling of it, you'd think happened yesterday. Their pigeons, on the other hand, possess no such charm. They’re brazen creatures, these feathered brigands, forever demanding tribute in the form of discarded bread crusts, and I wouldn't put it past them to steal a button off your coat if you stood still long enough. Genoa, she’s a city of contrasts, a bit dusty, a bit loud, a bit overwhelming, but then again, life itself can be a bit like that, and Genoa, at least, has the good grace to admit it.
