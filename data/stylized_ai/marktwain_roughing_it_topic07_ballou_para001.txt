Ballou, now there was a specimen. A tenderfoot if ever there was one, fresh from the East, a place so civilized you half expected folks to faint at the sight of a genuine mule. He arrived in Carson City looking like he’d stepped out of a bandbox, all starched collars and polished shoes, an outfit utterly wasted on the alkali dust and sagebrush. He claimed to be a lawyer, and I reckon he was, in the sense that a hog can be said to be a connoisseur of fine dining. He knew books, I'll grant him that, though the only law he ever practiced out here was the law of unintended consequences.

The man was harmless enough, mind you, just relentlessly, gloriously inept. He’d buy a gold mine guaranteed to yield fortunes, only to discover it was mostly fool's gold and gopher holes. He tried his hand at mining, bless his heart, but was more likely to strike water than pay dirt. I recall one time he was determined to learn how to ride a horse, got himself a swaybacked nag named Betsy, and spent half the day picking himself up from the dirt. He’d emerge from these escapades looking like he’d lost a fight with a cactus, his dignity in even worse shape than his trousers.

But Ballou had a certain stubborn optimism, a dogged refusal to admit defeat that was both exasperating and oddly endearing. He’d dust himself off, mend his spectacles, and launch into some new scheme with the same unwavering enthusiasm, despite all evidence pointing towards imminent disaster. You couldn’t help but feel a sort of reluctant affection for the fella. He was like a walking, talking lesson in the school of hard knocks, proving that even the greenest Easterner could find a way to make a fool of himself, even in the grand, unforgiving theater of the West. He never did strike it rich, mind you, but he provided us with plenty of laughter, which in this neck of the woods, is worth more than its weight in gold dust.
