Now, about this matter of bucksheesh, a word you'll hear rattled off in every dusty corner of the Orient, a word that clings to the air thicker than the scent of jasmine and donkey dung. It's a slippery thing, bucksheesh, hard to pin down with the rigid rules of a Sunday School lesson. Some call it bribery, and these are likely the same fellows who complain about the heat and the flies, missing the poetry in a well-placed palm greasing. I prefer to think of it as a lubricant, a necessary oil to keep the machinery of daily life from grinding to a halt. You see, in these lands, time ain't exactly money, but a well-timed bit of bucksheesh can certainly bend its ear and hurry it along.

Try, for instance, navigating a custom's house without a little "gift" for the fellow in charge. You'll be stuck there longer than a Baptist preacher trying to explain Darwin. Or perhaps you fancy a ride on a camel, but find the owner singularly unenthusiastic. A touch of bucksheesh, and suddenly that beast is practically begging for you to climb aboard, its humps wiggling with eager anticipation. Mind you, it ain't always about cutting corners. Sometimes it's just about recognizing the natural order of things. A little something for the sweeper, a little something for the water carrier, a little something for the man who guards your shoes – and suddenly, you're surrounded by a veritable army of loyal and remarkably attentive servants.

Of course, there's a fine line, a tightrope walk between a helpful gratuity and an outright fleecing. I once witnessed a particularly green traveler attempt to "encourage" a desert nomad to reveal the location of a hidden oasis with a sum that could have bought a small kingdom. The nomad, bless his cunning heart, led the poor fellow on a wild goose chase for three days, ending up right back where they started, only several degrees sunburnt and considerably poorer. The moral of the story? Bucksheesh is an art, not a science. One must learn the language, the nuances, the delicate dance of the coin. And above all, one must never, ever underestimate the innate entrepreneurial spirit of a man who's spent his entire life bargaining with the desert sun.
