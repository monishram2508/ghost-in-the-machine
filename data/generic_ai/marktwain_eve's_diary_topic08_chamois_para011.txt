Chamois, often referred to in singular or plural form identically, are captivating alpine mammals belonging to the genus *Rupicapra*, encompassing two distinct species: the Alpine chamois (*Rupicapra rupicapra*) and the Pyrenean chamois (*Rupicapra pyrenaica*). These agile creatures inhabit mountainous regions across Europe, from the rugged Alps and the imposing Pyrenees to the Balkan Peninsula and the Carpathian Mountains, generally favoring elevations between 1,000 and 3,500 meters. They are remarkably well-adapted to their challenging environment, possessing a lithe and muscular build that allows them to navigate steep, rocky terrain with incredible speed and grace. Their sure-footedness is aided by specialized hooves with a hard outer rim and a soft, rubbery inner pad, providing exceptional grip on slippery surfaces. Their coat color varies seasonally, typically transitioning from a rich reddish-brown in summer to a darker, thicker black or dark brown in winter, offering camouflage against the changing landscape. Both sexes sport short, hooked horns, typically between 15 and 25 centimeters long, which curve backwards near the tips. These horns, though present in both males and females, tend to be slightly larger and more curved in males, making them a subtle indicator of sex.

Chamois are primarily diurnal, meaning they are most active during daylight hours, especially in the early morning and late afternoon. They are primarily herbivores, feeding on a diet of grasses, herbs, leaves, and shoots, adapting their foraging habits to the seasonal availability of vegetation. During winter, when food is scarce, they may resort to browsing on pine needles and lichen. Social structure varies depending on the time of year. During the warmer months, chamois often form larger herds, consisting of females, kids, and younger males. Older males tend to be more solitary, joining the herds only during the mating season, which typically occurs in late autumn or early winter. During this period, males engage in fierce competition for mating rights, engaging in displays of dominance and occasionally violent clashes. The gestation period lasts around six months, with females typically giving birth to a single kid in late spring or early summer. The young chamois are precocial, meaning they are relatively well-developed at birth and able to follow their mothers shortly after. The kids remain with their mothers for about a year, learning essential survival skills before becoming independent. Chamois face threats from predators such as wolves, lynx, and golden eagles, as well as habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities. Climate change also poses a significant challenge, altering vegetation patterns and potentially impacting their distribution.
