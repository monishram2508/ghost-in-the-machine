Well, I do declare, this portier fellow, this… doorway drape, has been givin’ me fits, and not the kind a corset does after a hearty supper. Now, Adam, bless his simple heart, he don't notice nothin’ unless it’s got fur or feathers. He walks right past that fancy velvet curtain hangin’ there like a sad excuse for a rainbow, never once wonderin' how it got there or what purpose it serves beyond keepin' the drafts off his bare backside. But me? Oh, I've been ponderin' on this portier business like a hen ponderin' a particularly stubborn egg.

See, it's supposed to add a touch of elegance, a whisper of sophistication to our humble Eden abode. That's what the Seraphim catalogue promised, anyways. "Transform your cave into a cozy corner of Paradise with our luxuriant portiers!" it gushed. Luxuriant! It sounds like somethin' you'd find swimmin' in a swamp, not hangin' gracefully in your doorway. And graceful it ain't. It catches on my heel every time I try to pass, sendin' me a-stumblin' and a-cussin' (though I quickly apologize to the Almighty for my unladylike outburst, naturally).

Then there's the matter of its color. It's described as "sunset blush," but it looks suspiciously like the bruised end of a banana to my eye. And try as I might, I can't seem to find any way to make it hang straight. One side always droops lower than the other, like a melancholy elephant's ear. Adam just shrugs and says it gives the place "character." Character, indeed. Character is what I call the way he tracks mud all over the garden after a rainstorm. This portier? This is just pure, unadulterated aggravation disguised as interior decoratin’. Maybe I'll just unravel it and make myself a new apron. At least then it would be useful, instead of just standin' there, all droopy and bruised-lookin’, like a silent judge silently mockin' my homemakin' abilities. A woman deserves better than a banana-colored portier, I tell you what.
