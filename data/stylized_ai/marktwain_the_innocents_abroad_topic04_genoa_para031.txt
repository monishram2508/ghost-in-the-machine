Genoa, bless her heart, is a city built like a layer cake gone wrong, a jumble of tenements stacked precariously high, so that even the pigeons must suffer from vertigo. One wanders through the caruggi – those narrow, snaking alleyways that would make a self-respecting rat think twice before venturing forth – and wonders if sunlight ever dared to penetrate such gloomy depths. They say the sun shines brightly on Genoa, and I'm sure it does, somewhere up there above the rooftops; but down below, it’s perpetually twilight, like being trapped in a perpetually dusty drawing-room. The buildings themselves, oh, they’re fine enough, in a crumbling, faded sort of way, like dowager countesses who’ve seen better days. You see remnants of faded grandeur, the ghost of painted frescoes, the echoes of noble laughter, now replaced by the shouts of fishmongers and the rumble of Vespas piloted by fellows who appear to have a death wish – or perhaps a genuine desire to reach their destination five minutes sooner. The Genovese themselves are a study in contradictions. They strike a bargain harder than a flint striker striking steel, and they'll haggled over a lira with the ferocity of a dog guarding a bone, yet possess a startling kindness hidden beneath layers of gruffness and a decided suspicion of outsiders. They have a history long and storied, of merchant princes and naval battles, of daring explorers and shrewd financiers. One can almost smell the brine and gunpowder still clinging to the stones of the harbor, though nowadays, the battles are more likely to be fought over parking spaces than control of the Mediterranean. The harbor, ah, the harbor, a chaotic ballet of fishing boats, ferries, and monstrous container ships, all jostling for position, while seagulls screech their disapproval from above, as if they alone understand the utter absurdity of it all. Yes, Genoa is a peculiar place, a city that manages to be both beautiful and repellent, charming and infuriating, all at once. One leaves with a feeling of mild exhaustion, a faint ringing in the ears, and the distinct impression of having witnessed something utterly, and gloriously, unique.
