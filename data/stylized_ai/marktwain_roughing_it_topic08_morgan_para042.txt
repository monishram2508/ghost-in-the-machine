Now, Morgan, bless his ever-lovin' hide, was a specimen carved right out of the granite of the Sierra Nevada, and just about as subtle. He weren't much for book-learnin', mind you; declared Shakespeare gave him the hives and Milton was only good for lining birdcages. But he knew the worth of a good mule, could sniff out gold from a mile off, and possessed a talent for tellin' tall tales that would make Baron Munchausen blush and stammer. He claimed to have once wrestled a grizzly bear for a prime claim, using nothin' but a rusty pickaxe and a wad of chewing tobacco. Whether there was a kernel of truth in that or not is anybody's guess, but nobody in their right mind would call him a liar to his face. He had a beard that could house a family of field mice and eyes that twinkled like fool's gold in a pan. Wore the same buckskin jacket for nigh on twenty years, said it held the scent of luck. Reckon it also held the scent of dust, sweat, and stale beans, but you couldn't tell Morgan that.

He was a walking contradiction, that one. Could be as generous as a drunken prospector splurging his newfound fortune one minute, and as tight-fisted as a church deacon the next. He'd lend you his last dime if you were down on your luck, then haggle over the price of a cup of coffee like it was a king's ransom. He had a heart of gold, buried deep beneath layers of cynicism and a stubborn streak that could stop a runaway stagecoach. He was a marvel to behold, really, a throwback to a wilder, untamed time. A man who lived life on his own terms, feared no man, and worshipped nothin' but the promise of riches and the open road. He was, in short, the quintessential Westerner, and the West wouldn't have been the West without a few Morgans kicking up dust and causing a ruckus. Even if half of what he said was a flat-out fabrication, he made life a darn sight more entertainin'.
