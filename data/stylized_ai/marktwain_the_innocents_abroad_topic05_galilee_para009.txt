Galilee, they call it. Galilee! Why, it sounds like some sort of exotic pastry, doesn't it? Perhaps filled with dates and figs, dusted with powdered sugar and offered on a silver platter by dusky maidens. But alas, reality, as is its wont, plays a cruel jest upon the unsuspecting traveler. It's a region alright, but more rugged than romantic, and filled more with rocks and thistles than anything a sensible fellow would want to sink his teeth into. They say it's fertile, a land flowing with milk and honey, which is a pretty thing to say, mind you. But I, having tramped over most of it, must confess I've seen more goats than cows, and the only honey I encountered was clinging to the beard of a particularly persistent bee who seemed determined to make my acquaintance in a most unpleasant manner.

The Sea of Galilee, now there's a body of water that's heard a tall tale or two. They say the savior himself walked upon it, which is either the most miraculous feat of engineering I've ever heard of or the water wasn't quite as deep as they let on. I reckon the latter, knowing how these biblical sorts have a tendency to embroider their narratives with a bit of fancywork. It's a modest lake, certainly no ocean, though it has a certain charm. The fishermen there are a salty lot, though whether from the sea's spray or their own inherent dispositions, I couldn't rightly say. They mend their nets with a diligence born of necessity, their faces tanned and creased by the sun, their eyes as keen as a hawk's searching for the day's catch. I attempted a bit of angling myself, but the fish seemed to possess a sharper wit than I, remaining stubbornly submerged and ignoring my bait with a studied indifference that bordered on insult. One imagines, however, that it is beautiful in the right light, or perhaps after enough wine. All things are, I suppose.
