Slade, that hell-roaring, gulch-gouging, pistol-packing son-of-a-jackalope, was a study in controlled demolition disguised as a man. He was a sight to behold, him, with eyes that could bore a hole through a granite mountain and a jaw that looked like it had taken more than a few hits from a saloon brawl. You wouldn't find him in a church pew on Sunday morning, unless it was to settle some sort of a score with the preacher about a stray hog or a gambling debt. No, Slade was more at home in the smoky backrooms of saloons, dealing faro with a deck that likely had more cards up his sleeve than a magician at a county fair. Claimed he was fair, always, but fair in Slade's dictionary probably meant everyone else got a fair chance to lose their shirt to him.

He was a law unto himself, that one. Carried more iron on him than a blacksmith’s apprentice, and used it with a speed that would make a hummingbird look like it was stuck in molasses. I heard tales, mind you, whispers around campfires and muttered in stagecoaches, about Slade settling disputes with a swiftness that left everyone wondering if they’d actually seen what they thought they had. Some said he was a murderer, plain and simple. Others claimed he was just a necessary evil, a sort of… uh… industrial-strength broom to sweep the riff-raff out of the West. Me? I reckon he was probably a little bit of both.

But you couldn't deny the man had a certain presence. Like a thunderstorm brewing on the horizon, you felt it in your bones before you ever saw it. And when he spoke, well, even the wind seemed to hold its breath. He ran the stagecoach lines out this way, a king in his own dusty kingdom, and did so with an iron fist and a wink. Always with a wink. Makes one wonder if he actually had a heart under all that leather and gunpowder, or if it was just another cleverly disguised pistol. Either way, I'd rather not be the one to find out.
