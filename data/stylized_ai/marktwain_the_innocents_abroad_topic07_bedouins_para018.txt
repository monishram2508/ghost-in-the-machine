The Bedouin, bless their sun-baked hides and nomadic souls, are a peculiar bunch, I tell you. Imagine a fellow swaddled in more cloth than a pharaoh's mummy, squinting at a horizon that stretches farther than a temperance preacher's sermon. They roam the Arabian deserts, these chaps, with their camels swaggering along like ships of the sand, thinking themselves grander than any railroad tycoon. They follow the rain, these wanderers, chasing after a few paltry blades of grass for their mangy goats and those aforementioned, haughty camels. Why they don't just settle down and take up a respectable trade, like selling patent medicines or swindling gullible tourists, is beyond my comprehension. 

Now, don't misunderstand me, they are hospitable sorts, or so I’m told. Offer you a cup of coffee so strong it could curdle milk, and a tent woven from goat hair that smells vaguely of goat. You'll be itching for a bath after a mere five minutes, mind you, but manners are manners, and one must endure such trials when traveling in foreign lands. Their tales, however, are a thing of wonder, spun from moonlight and sandstorms, featuring Djinns and flying carpets, all of which I suspect are greatly embellished, much like a politician's campaign promises. And their knowledge of the stars! They navigate by them, these Bedouins, while I have difficulty navigating my way back to the hotel after a particularly robust supper. They claim to know the desert better than they know their own children, which, considering the number of children they tend to have, is perhaps not saying much. Still, one cannot deny a grudging respect for a people who can not only survive but seemingly thrive in a place where a lizard would pack his bags and move to a more temperate climate. They are, in essence, a stubborn, dusty, and rather charming enigma, those Bedouins, a living reminder that comfort and common sense aren't always the measure of a life well-lived. Though I, for one, am quite content with my plush armchair and a glass of something considerably less potent than Bedouin coffee.
