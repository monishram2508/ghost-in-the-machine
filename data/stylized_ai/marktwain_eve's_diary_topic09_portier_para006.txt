Now, about this portier contraption. Land sakes, what a peculiar notion some fellas have about decorating! Here was a thing, hanging right there in the doorway, like a lost soul waiting for Judgment Day. Not a proper door, mind you, no slammin’ or lockin’ to be done. Just a swathe of fabric, usually thick and heavy as a winter’s conscience, trying to impersonate a wall. Said to keep out the drafts, it was, but I reckon a well-fed cat would do a better job, and provide entertainment to boot. This portier, though, just hung there, a silent judge of comings and goings.

The colors they choose! Often something deep and brooding, as if the room beyond was harboring a dark secret. Reds and browns, mostly, like a sunset gone bad, or maybe a spilled pot of coffee that nobody bothered to clean. Sometimes you’d find one with fringes, dangling like the beard of some forgotten patriarch. Those fringes, now, they were a playground for dust bunnies and mischievous kittens. I’ve seen more than one cat swinging from those things, convinced they’d discovered a new species of vine.

And the purpose? Well, that’s a question fit to vex a philosopher. They said it was for privacy. Privacy! With a good holler, you could hear everything happening on the other side, and the shadow puppets cast upon its surface offered a fair approximation of the goings-on. It was more a suggestion of privacy, a sort of polite fiction we all agreed to maintain. "Oh, I can’t see you undress behind that crimson curtain," we’d pretend, "but I can certainly hear every rustle and sigh." I tell you, the things we do in the name of decency would make a saint blush. And as for beauty? Well, beauty’s in the eye of the beholder, they say. And I reckon some beholders must have mighty peculiar eyes indeed. All in all, the portier seemed to be a whole lot of fuss over not very much at all, but like a stubborn mule it always remained.
