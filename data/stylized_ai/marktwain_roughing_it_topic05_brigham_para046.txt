Brigham Young, now there's a specimen ripe for the pickin'. A man of iron will and a vocabulary that could bend the ten commandments to his purpose. They say he ruled those Mormons out in the desert like a Caesar with a holy hymnbook in one hand and a branding iron in the other. Now, I ain't one to judge a man’s religious convictions, seeing as how I've seen more varieties of 'em in the West than there are species of jackrabbit, but Brigham, well, he took the cake and ate it too. A fella with a dozen or so wives, they said, each convinced she was the favorite – a domestic arrangement that sounds more like a powder keg waiting for a spark than any kind of celestial bliss I ever heard tell of. Course, try to imagine remembering all their birthdays! That alone ought to qualify him for sainthood, if you ask me.

He built Salt Lake City from dust and dreams, though. No small feat when you're talking about turning a desolate valley into a promised land with nothing but faith, hard work, and maybe a little bit of shrewd financial maneuvering. I heard tell he was tighter than bark on a tree when it came to the Lord's money, but he sure knew how to make a dollar stretch. Some folks called him a prophet, others a tyrant; I reckon he was probably a bit of both, mixed in with a healthy dose of practicality. He figured out how to keep those Mormons together in the face of hell and high water and federal troops. A showman, alright. He knew how to work a crowd, to paint a vision of Zion that was so compelling folks would trek halfway across the continent just to get a slice of it. Maybe he believed every word he said, maybe he didn't. But either way, he built something out there, something that's still standing, and that, my friend, is more than most of us can claim.
