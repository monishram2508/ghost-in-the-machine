Heidelberg, you say? A place renowned, I am told, for its university and its castle. I found it all rather charming, in a dilapidated, crumbling sort of way. Imagine, if you will, a town crammed full of young men in spectacles, all furiously scribbling and debating in guttural German. One might think they were plotting the overthrow of empires, but I suspect they were merely arguing over the correct translation of some long-dead philosopher – bless their diligent, misguided hearts. The castle, oh, that glorious ruin! A monument to vanity and gunpowder, perched precariously on a hill like a drunken uncle at a wedding. One could almost picture the lords and ladies of yore, bedecked in finery, quaffing flagons of wine and plotting the ruin of their neighbors. Now, all that remains are moss-covered stones and the echoes of laughter, a silent testament to the ephemeral nature of human endeavor. I even stumbled upon a giant wine barrel, a vessel so large it could comfortably house a family of hippopotamuses. The Germans, you see, take their wine seriously – or perhaps they simply have a preternatural fear of going thirsty. And the Neckar River! Flowing merrily along, reflecting the sunlight and carrying with it the secrets of centuries. A truly lovely sight, until one considers the number of unfortunate souls who likely met their end within its murky depths, perhaps while fleeing a particularly stern professor or a particularly demanding landlord. In truth, Heidelberg is a place that grows on you, like a particularly tenacious vine. One begins by mocking its quaintness, its history, its preponderance of erudite young men. But before one knows it, one is captivated by its charm, seduced by its story, and hopelessly entangled in its old-world allure. One departs with a sigh, a touch of melancholy, and the unsettling feeling that one has left a small piece of one's heart behind, nestled amongst the ivy-covered stones and the endless flow of the Neckar.
