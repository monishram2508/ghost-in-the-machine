Now, about this edifice they call a mosque, a sight you’re bound to stumble upon in your travels through lands touched by, shall we say, the Ottoman persuasion. It’s a curious affair, really, like some sort of architectural confectionery, all domes and minarets striving for the heavens as if trying to outdo the local mountains in a game of pomp. They paint these minarets a startling white, too, so they fairly singe your eyeballs on a sunny day, making you wonder if they couldn’t have settled on a more agreeable shade, perhaps a sensible beige or a calming moss green. But no, white it is, declaring its devout purpose to all and sundry, even the heathen goats bleating in the distance.

Inside, things are generally spacious, though somewhat short on furniture, unless you consider a rather lavish carpet furniture. One would almost expect to see a grand piano or a billiard table tucked away in a corner, but alas, no such luck. Instead, there are rows upon rows for the faithful to prostrate themselves, facing, as I understand it, toward Mecca – a place I’ve heard mentioned with a reverence generally reserved for a well-aged whiskey. They murmur and bow and chant, a practice I confess I haven’t quite mastered, though I’ve attempted to mimic the bowing part after a particularly potent dinner, with results that were, shall we say, less than reverent.

And the muezzin, bless his soul, he climbs that minaret five times a day and howls out his call to prayer. A fellow can't help but wonder if he ever gets tired of it, like a rooster who’s crowed once too often. It's a sound that’ll wake the dead, assuming the dead are hard of hearing and haven't already gotten used to it. Some folks claim it's beautiful, and who am I to argue with beauty? It's certainly... persistent. All in all, the mosque is a peculiar and intriguing landmark, a testament to faith and a fine example of what humans can accomplish when they set their minds to building something really, really tall. Even if it *does* require a pair of dark spectacles.
