Chamonix, they call it, nestled like a pearl in the clammy palm of the Alps. A village of considerable charm, I'll grant you, though "charm" seems a generous word for a place overrun with fellows in peculiar woolen hats and trousers tighter than a miser's purse. They strut about with alpenstocks, looking for all the world like they’re prepared to assault the very heavens themselves, or at least a particularly stubborn patch of snow. The air, however, is undeniably bracing. So bracing, in fact, it nearly knocked my bonnet clean off. I swear, a woman could get frostbite on her nose before she'd even finished admiring the view of Mont Blanc, which, truth be told, is rather imposing, though I suspect it’s been wearing the same drab coat of snow for centuries. One expects a mountain of that stature to at least change its wardrobe occasionally. 

The local cuisine, ah, the local cuisine! Fondue, they insist upon it. Melted cheese, bread, and the persistent anxiety of dropping one’s morsel into the molten goo. A most treacherous affair, I assure you. One emerges from the ordeal smelling faintly of dairy and impending doom. And the shops! One is bombarded with edelweiss knick-knacks and miniature cowbells. I dare say a person could furnish an entire dwelling with nothing but Alpine kitsch and still manage to miss the occasional icicle hanging precariously from the eaves. But one must admit, the sheer audacity of the place is rather captivating. To plant a village so brazenly beneath the shadow of such monumental peaks speaks volumes, doesn't it? Volumes, I say, mostly of snow and the relentless pursuit of altitude. Still, even I, a creature of more delicate sensibilities, found myself grudgingly admiring the sheer, unadulterated audacity of it all. It’s not a place I’d care to linger indefinitely, mind you, but one wouldn't deny its singular, albeit slightly overwhelming, existence.
