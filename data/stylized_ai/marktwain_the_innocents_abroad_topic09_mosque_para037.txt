Now, I reckon a mosque, that’s a sight to behold, in its own peculiar way, mind you. It ain’t your run-of-the-mill church, spires reaching for the Almighty like a fellow grasping for a stray feather in a windstorm. No sir, a mosque tends to squat a bit, humble-like, with a dome or two swelling up like a baker’s yeast gone plumb mad. These domes, they ain't just there for show, though show they do provide, especially when the sunlight hits them just so and bounces back like a sassy wink from a painted lady. Inside, it's a world away from the bustling marketplace outside, or the clatter of life in general. You shed your boots, lest you track in the dust of the world, and step onto carpets thick enough to lose a small dog in.

The walls are often adorned with calligraphy, swirls and loops that look like a spider got hold of an ink pot and went on a philosophical rampage. Of course, I ain't learned enough to decipher the meaning of these fine doodles, but I’m told they’re verses from the holy book, words that are supposed to soothe the soul and remind you to be a decent human being, which, let's be honest, most folks need reminding of now and again. There ain’t pews, you see, none of that formal sit-down business. Folks just kneel, heads bowed towards Mecca, all lined up like a flock of birds ready for migration. And then the imam, bless his booming voice, starts chanting, a melody that rises and falls like the Missouri River in springtime. It's a sound that can rattle your bones and make you feel like you're standing in the presence of something grander than yourself, even if you can't understand a single blessed word. It’s a peaceful sight, a reminder that no matter what foolishness we humans get up to, there’s always a place for a bit of quiet contemplation, away from the hullabaloo and the scheming. Unless, of course, you happen to be standing next to a fella who’s got a persistent case of the sniffles, then all bets are off on the peace and quiet front.
