The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a Christian restorationist church founded by Joseph Smith in the United States in 1830. Smith, whom Latter-day Saints consider a prophet, claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates revealed to him by an angel named Moroni. This book, along with the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, serves as foundational scripture for the church. A central tenet of Mormon belief is the restoration of the original church established by Jesus Christ, with a focus on modern-day prophets and continuing revelation. This distinguishes them from traditional Protestant denominations. Historically, the church faced significant persecution due to its unique doctrines, including plural marriage, which led to their migration westward and eventual settlement in Utah under the leadership of Brigham Young.

Mormon theology encompasses a unique view of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as distinct beings united in purpose, forming what they term the Godhead. They believe in the importance of temple worship and rituals, including proxy baptism for the dead, aimed at offering salvation to ancestors. Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving voluntary missions for two years or more, spreading the church's message globally. Members adhere to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which encourages avoiding alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, and illicit drugs while promoting healthy eating habits and exercise. Strong emphasis is placed on family values, community involvement, and personal righteousness. The church maintains a hierarchical structure with local congregations, called wards, led by lay members. At the higher levels, the church is guided by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Presidency, which consists of the President of the Church and his counselors. Despite facing past controversies and continued scrutiny regarding certain doctrines, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown into a global faith with millions of members worldwide, known for its strong community, charitable efforts, and emphasis on personal and spiritual development.
