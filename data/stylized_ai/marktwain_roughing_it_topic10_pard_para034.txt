Now, Pard, there's a creature that walks amongst us, generally upright, mostly harmless as a kitten until riled up, and possessed of a hide tougher than a miner's pickaxe. This pard, you see, he ain't your average feller. He's the one who'll clap you on the back with a force that dislocates your shoulder and tell you it’s just a friendly gesture, just before he borrows your last dollar with a promise that's flimsier than a politician's pledge. He's the kind who'll swear he saw a mountain lion wearing a top hat in the saloon last Tuesday, and argue the point with the conviction of a preacher defending the Gospel, even if you saw him swilling whiskey straight from the bottle that very night.

You can usually spot 'em by their proneness to exaggeration, a trait so deeply ingrained it's practically a sixth sense. He'll tell you about the gold nugget he found that was bigger than his head, conveniently forgetting that his head ain't much bigger than a cantaloupe. He'll claim he wrestled a grizzly bear single-handed, leaving out the part where the bear was mostly preoccupied with eating a salmon the size of a small dog. He's got a story for every occasion, and each one is taller than a redwood. 

They also possess a peculiar talent for creating chaos. Leave 'em unattended for five minutes and you'll find your mule trying to climb a tree, your campfire fueled with your best shirt, and a rumor spreading that you've struck a vein of pure silver that rivals the Comstock. Not that he intends any malice, mind you. It's just that his brain works a little sideways, like a burro trying to understand algebra.

But here's the rub, pard: underneath all the bluster and balderdash, beneath the tall tales and accidental catastrophes, there's usually a good heart beating like a triphammer. He'll give you the shirt off his back, even if it's the only one he owns (and probably borrowed in the first place). He'll defend you against a bully, even if he's smaller than the bully's boot. And he'll always be there with a crooked smile and a tall story to cheer you up when you're down in the dumps. So, you gotta take the good with the bad when it comes to a pard, and remember that a little bit of nonsense makes the world a darn sight more interesting. Just keep a close eye on your wallet, and maybe hide your favorite shirt.
