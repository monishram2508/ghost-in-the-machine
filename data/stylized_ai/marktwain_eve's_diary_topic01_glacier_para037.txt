Well, I reckon I've seen sights aplenty in my long stretch on this here planet, but a glacier? Now, that's a contraption designed by a committee of geological busybodies with far too much time on their hands. Imagine, if you will, a river made of ice, but afflicted with a terrible case of sloth. A river that ain't in no particular hurry to reach the sea, and when it does, why, it's liable to bring half the mountain along with it. It's a marvel, I grant you, but a marvel of such monumental and lethargic proportions that it’s nearly impossible to fully comprehend without growing a beard down to your knees just staring at it.

It crawls along, this icy beast, grinding rocks into powder finer than any dusting flour you ever did see, and carving out valleys deep enough to bury a whole town. It's a powerful creature, though a mightily slow one, like an elephant trying to waltz. And it leaves its mark, I tell you. Big rocks tossed about like marbles, landscapes rearranged like a lady changing her mind about wallpaper. Why, it's enough to make you think the world's a grand experiment run by a gang of mischievous giants with a penchant for playing with ice cream.

And the color! That ice, it ain't just white, not by a long shot. It's blue, the bluest blue you ever did see, so deep and pure it makes the sky look like a washed-out rag. It's like looking into the heart of winter itself, a cold and beautiful heart, that's been buried there for centuries. Then it melts and gets all watery, and creates new rivers, so the landscape keeps changing, forever. It's enough to make your head spin and send you for a bottle of whiskey, that's what it is! It's proof that this old world keeps changing, whether we like it or not.
