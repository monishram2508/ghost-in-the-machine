The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, represents a distinct branch within Christianity, characterized by its belief in continuing revelation and unique scriptures alongside the Bible. Founded in the early 19th century by Joseph Smith, the faith centers on the Book of Mormon, which members believe to be another testament of Jesus Christ, containing a narrative of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Key tenets include a belief in the literal gathering of Israel, the restoration of priesthood authority, and the importance of temple worship and ordinances. Mormons hold a distinctive view of the Godhead, believing in three distinct and separate beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, unified in purpose. This departs from the traditional Trinitarian view held by many other Christian denominations.

A strong emphasis on family and community is central to Mormon life. The Church actively promotes traditional family values, encourages large families, and provides extensive support networks for its members. This support extends beyond spiritual guidance, encompassing welfare programs, educational opportunities, and social activities. Missionary service is a significant aspect of the faith, with young men and women often dedicating one to two years to proselytizing and serving in various parts of the world. This missionary work contributes to the Church's global presence and its diverse membership. Mormon culture is often characterized by a commitment to wholesome living, including abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, as well as adhering to a strict moral code. The Church's historical origins are marked by periods of persecution and migration, ultimately leading to the establishment of Salt Lake City, Utah, as its headquarters. While the practice of polygamy, once a central doctrine, was officially discontinued in the late 19th century, it remains a significant aspect of the Church's history and continues to be a subject of discussion and debate. Modern Mormonism strives to balance its unique beliefs and practices with engagement in broader society, participating in interfaith dialogues, humanitarian efforts, and contributing to various fields of endeavor.
