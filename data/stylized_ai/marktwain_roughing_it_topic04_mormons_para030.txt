Well, I reckon I've seen a thing or two in my ramblings across this here continent, and let me tell you, the Mormons, they're a breed all their own. I stumbled upon Salt Lake City, a place built seemingly out of pure grit and faith, like some kind of divine carpenter had a blueprint and a whole lot of stubbornness. Now, I ain't here to preach, mind you, but these folks have got a story, and a peculiar one at that. Claimed an angel by the name of Moroni showed up and delivered some gold plates, all written up in a language no living soul could decipher – except, of course, for one Joseph Smith. Seems mighty convenient to me, but who am I to argue with divine intervention? They translated that thing into the Book of Mormon, a whole new chapter in the Bible, practically.

And polygamy, bless their hearts! Brigham Young, that fella had more wives than I've had hot dinners, and that's sayin' something. They've officially given that business up, mind, but it was quite the spectacle while it lasted. I heard tales of houses full of children, all calling the same man "Papa," like some sort of organized, divinely sanctioned chaos. They work hard, these Mormons, like bees in a hive. Made the desert bloom, they did. Irrigation ditches all over the place, crops growing where you wouldn't think a tumbleweed could survive. They’ve got their temples, grand structures that gleam in the sun, fancier than any saloon I ever saw. Dedicated folks, they are. I reckon they believe it all down to their very bones. And while I might scratch my head at some of their notions, I can't fault a person for holding fast to what they believe in. Makes a fella wonder sometimes, doesn't it, what strange and wonderful things folks will believe in, just so long as it gives them a little hope in this rough and tumble world.
