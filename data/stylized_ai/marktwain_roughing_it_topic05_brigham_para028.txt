Brigham, now there’s a name that echoes through the gullies and canyons of Utah like a lovesick coyote’s howl at midnight. Brigham Young, Prophet, President, and purveyor of wives beyond counting – why, the man had more spouses than a centipede has shoes, and twice the trouble keeping track of them all, I reckon. I saw him once, riding through Salt Lake City on a mule that looked about as enthusiastic about the whole affair as I was about prospecting for fool’s gold after a week of nothing but hardtack and alkali water. Brigham, bless his booming voice and his canny eye for a profitable bit of land, had that certain…*gravitas*, you might call it. Or maybe it was just the sheer weight of responsibility, what with leading a flock of thousands across the plains, dodging Indians, and trying to convince 'em that crickets were a delicacy best enjoyed deep-fried.

He was a builder, that's undeniable, laying out Salt Lake like a particularly ambitious game of dominoes and preaching the gospel with a fire that could singe the beard right off a grizzly. Some folks called him a tyrant, naturally. Those were generally the fellas who hadn’t quite cottoned to the idea of communal farming or sharing water rights with the entire blessed territory. But he held things together, somehow. Imagine wrangling that many souls, each with their own opinions, their own grievances, their own hunger for a bit of decent tobacco. Why, it'd be easier to teach a jackrabbit to play the banjo.

And yet, there he was, stern-faced and determined, carving a kingdom out of the desert with nothing but faith, grit, and a healthy dose of, shall we say, “persuasion.” He wasn't exactly a saint, mind you – saints don't usually accumulate wealth and wield the kind of power Brigham did. But he was a force. A raw, untamed force of nature, like a flash flood barreling down a canyon, leaving behind a trail of dust, debris, and, eventually, a thriving civilization. Now, whether that civilization was worth the price of admission, well, that's a question for another time, and another bottle of rye.
