Gibraltar, bless its sun-baked little heart, is a sight and a story all its own, perched there like a defiant, if rather diminutive, lion guarding the entrance to the Mediterranean. It's a place where one is reminded that the British Empire, though much shrunk and pruned like an overzealous gardener's rose bush, yet clings to a few choice cuttings with the tenacity of a lovesick leech. The Rock itself, a monstrous lump of limestone thrusting skyward, is undoubtedly the main attraction, and it is quite the geological oddity, if you'll pardon my bluntness. One can take a carriage, though the scent of horse and the constant, desperate pleas from the driver for “just one more shilling” do rather detract from the romance of it all. Or, for the more adventurous soul, there is the cable car, a contraption that creaks and groans its way upward with all the enthusiasm of an arthritic donkey, offering a panoramic view that is undeniably grand, provided you can stomach the stomach-churning sway of it all.

The town below is a peculiar jumble, a veritable stew of British familiarity and Mediterranean flair. Red telephone boxes stand incongruously beside tapas bars, and the locals, bless their hearts, conduct their business with a charming blend of British reserve and Spanish zest. The main street, filled with shops hawking perfumes and trinkets, is a veritable gauntlet for the discerning traveler, who must navigate a throng of tourists while fending off the insistent calls of shopkeepers eager to part them from their hard-earned coin. Then there are the apes. Ah, the Barbary Macaques, Gibraltar's notorious residents, who are said to be the guardians of the Rock, and who, if one is to believe the local lore, will cause the whole of Gibraltar to crumble should they ever leave. They are amusing creatures to be sure, with their mischievous eyes and their nimble fingers, prone to snatching anything that isn't bolted down, from sunglasses to sandwiches. One might even say they are the most cunning and unapologetic thieves south of London, though perhaps I am being a tad unkind. Still, one can't help but feel a bit taken advantage of when a simian rascal absconds with your prize-winning pasty! Gibraltar, you see, is a place of such captivating contradictions.
