Heidelberg! A town clinging to the Neckar like a lovesick leech, so enamored of the river it practically spills into it. I swear, the burghers must spend half their days propping up the buildings to keep them from sliding into a watery grave. But bless their industrious little hearts, they manage, even if the streets themselves are as crooked as a politician’s promises. The castle, ah, the castle! A majestic ruin, they call it. Majestic, indeed! Majestic in its state of arrested decay, like a once-handsome gentleman discovered years later in tattered finery, still boasting of his youthful conquests. One half expects a rusty suit of armor to come clattering down the hill at any moment, ridden by a spectral knight searching for his lost lance, or perhaps just a decent stein of beer. And the Great Vat! Good heavens, what an invention! Capable of holding enough wine to drown the entire population of Bavaria – a rather appealing thought, when one considers some of the brass bands one encounters there. I half-expected to see Bacchus himself reclining within, attended by a chorus line of tipsy nymphs. Of course, it was empty, as these things invariably are. Still, one could imagine. The students, though. Ah, the students! A rambunctious lot, forever puffing at their pipes and carousing in the taverns, their faces scarred with the evidence of collegiate combat. They claim it’s all terribly romantic, these duels, but frankly, it looked rather painful. Still, who am I to judge? Perhaps a good scar is just what a young man needs to give him the proper air of world-weariness. And the beer, of course, flows like the Neckar itself – murky, relentless, and ultimately, rather enjoyable, provided one doesn’t overindulge. Which, naturally, I did. Heidelberg, you see, has a way of persuading one to embrace the fleeting pleasures of this mortal coil, even if it leaves you with a headache the size of the castle itself the next morning.
