Chamonix, they call it. A place seemingly stapled to the foot of Mont Blanc, which, let me tell you, cuts the sky like a badly sharpened kitchen knife attempting to carve a particularly obstinate roast. It's a town overflowing with the sort of robust individuals who seem to think battling gravity on a sheer ice face is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Bless their cotton socks, they've probably never spent a restful afternoon swatting flies and sipping lemonade. One sees them everywhere, these mountaineering fellows, swaggering about in their brightly colored garb, looking for all the world like escaped parrots who've stumbled upon a hardware store. They’re forever discussing ropes, crampons, and the various degrees of peril, employing terminology that sounds suspiciously like a secret language devised specifically to baffle a humble observer such as myself. One hears tales of daring rescues and near-death experiences with alarming regularity; it gives one the feeling that the air itself is thick with the ghosts of ill-advised yodels.

And the tourists! Good heavens, the tourists! An international horde, converging upon this tiny village like ants upon a dropped éclair. They come armed with cameras, guidebooks thicker than bibles, and a fervent desire to prove they too have conquered the Alps, even if their conquest consists only of standing in a queue for the Aiguille du Midi cable car, which, by the way, is an experience akin to being squeezed into a sardine can with a bunch of anxious strangers. Afterwards, one can observe them, slightly green around the gills, posing for photographs with the aforementioned mountain in the background, trying to appear nonchalant while secretly wondering if they've left the oven on back in Dusseldorf. The entire spectacle, I confess, is both bewildering and strangely captivating. One might even say, with a touch of theatrical flair, that Chamonix is a play performed daily, with the mountain as the stoic, silent backdrop, and humanity, in all its glorious absurdity, as the leading players. A drama played out amidst breathtaking beauty and a healthy dose of sheer, unadulterated, nerve-wracking altitude. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I shall seek out a slightly less precarious locale and contemplate the inherent folly of mankind over a small glass of something fortifying.
