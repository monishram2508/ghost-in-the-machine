Them miners. Lord, a more curious and ornery bunch never did scrape at the bowels of the earth. You'd find 'em, come dawn, already halfway to China, pickax swingin' like a preacher's fist on Sunday, searchin' for that glint of fool's gold or, if they was lucky, the real McCoy. Didn't matter if they found nothin' but hard granite and disappointment, they'd keep at it. Stubborn as a Missouri mule, they were. And just as prone to kickin' if you got too close to their claim. Each one thought his hole in the ground was the next Comstock Lode, just waitin' for him to unearth it. Dreams bigger than all Nevada crammed into those grubby pockets, alongside a wad of tobacco and maybe a lucky charm, usually a petrified lizard or a rusty horseshoe.

They were a sight, too. Covered in more dirt than clothes, lookin' like they'd been baptized in mud. Whiskers thicker than sagebrush, squintin' eyes that could spot a nugget at twenty paces, and a vocabulary that'd make a sailor blush. Arguments were their pastime, and gamblin' their religion. They'd argue over the best way to blast a vein, the true color of a jackrabbit's eye, or which saloon served the stiffest whiskey. And then, quick as you please, they'd be sharin' a chew and laughin' like old friends. Generous souls, mostly, though they'd haggle with the devil himself over a pinch of salt. Never saw a miner refuse a hand to someone down on their luck, even if he was down on his own. They had a code, these fellas, unwritten but respected. "Strike it rich, or die tryin'," seemed to be the motto, etched in sweat and grit on their weathered faces. And Lord knows, a good many of 'em did just that – died tryin'. Still, you had to admire their grit, their audacity, and their unwavering belief that tomorrow, maybe just tomorrow, that blessed yellow metal would finally shine on them. They were fools, yes, but they were *our* fools, and this here territory wouldn't be nothin' without 'em.
