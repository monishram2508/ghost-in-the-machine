Now, this Colosseum, this grand old amphitheater in Rome, is quite a spectacle, ain't it? A mountain of stone, chipped and scarred by the tooth of time, a testament to both the grandeur of empires and the sheer idiocy of human nature, if you ask me. They say gladiators fought here, you know, these burly fellows, oiled and gleaming, hacking at each other with swords and shields, all for the amusement of a crowd roaring like a pack of wolves at a particularly succulent sheep. Picture it – senators in their togas, ladies fanning themselves with peacock feathers, all utterly delighted by the sight of a man getting his innards rearranged. Makes you wonder about the march of progress, doesn't it? We’ve swapped swords for stock options, but the craving for a good show of misery seems remarkably persistent.

And the animals, Lord have mercy! Elephants, lions, ostriches – dragged from the far corners of the earth, just to be slaughtered in this colossal arena. One can only imagine the thoughts running through the mind of a poor giraffe, suddenly finding itself in the middle of a Roman holiday, facing off against a gladiator with a rather unkind-looking trident. No doubt the giraffe was pondering the existential absurdity of its predicament, while the crowd cheered on the carnage. Some say the sands were stained red with blood for centuries, though I suspect a bit of romantic exaggeration there. Still, enough blood was spilled within those walls to fill the Tiber, I reckon. And for what? Glory? Entertainment? Vanity? A good day out for the family? It all smacks of a rather barbaric picnic, if you consider it carefully. Though, I must admit, the acoustics were magnificent, even after all these years. I tried yelling "Land ho!" just to see if it echoed, and by Jove, it did. A testament to Roman engineering, even if the whole enterprise was built on a foundation of brutality and bad taste.
