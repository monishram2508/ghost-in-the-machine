Now, about this creature they call the chamois – a kind of goat-antelope hybrid, I suspect, for Providence, in its infinite wisdom, seems to have taken a liking to mixing things up. It occupies itself mainly in the Alps, those mountainous piles of rock and snow where, if you ask me, a sensible creature would not choose to live, let alone raise a family. But the chamois, bless its simple heart, does just that. It spends its days leaping about on precipices that would give a bird vertigo, nibbling at the scant vegetation that dares to poke its head out of the stony ground. It's a curious life, you see, all near-death experiences and chewing on what looks like dried grass clippings.

And what's more, the creature seems to *enjoy* it! I suppose, like with most things, it's all a matter of perspective. To a chamois, a sheer drop of a thousand feet is probably just a minor inconvenience, akin to stepping over a puddle in the street. To me, of course, it's a reason to require smelling salts and a strong beverage. But then, I am a creature of comfort, not one designed for aerial acrobatics.

It is also a wary beast, which I cannot fault it for. Being preyed upon by eagles, wolves, and the occasional adventurous human, one develops a certain alertness, a quickness of foot, and a healthy distrust of anything that isn't a rock or a particularly stubborn patch of moss. I observed, during a brief, and frankly terrifying, expedition to one of these "Alps," that even a falling snowflake seemed to give them pause. They would freeze, those beady eyes fixed on the heavens, then resume their grazing as if to say, "Well, that was almost the end of me. Now, where were we?" It's this resilience, this comical dedication to life in the face of constant danger, that gives the chamois a certain charm, even if it is a charm best appreciated from a very safe distance, with a good pair of binoculars and a firm grip on a cup of something fortifying. One must appreciate Nature's jokes from afar, lest you find yourself a part of the punchline.
