Now, Galilee, that’s a region that could give a saint the itch to pack up and seek solace in a billiard hall. They call it “the Galilee,” mind you, as if there's just the one. As if you could mistake it for some other dusty, sun-baked parcel of land where the goats bleat at the crack of dawn and the donkeys argue theology in their own stubborn way. The Sea of Galilee, they have there, which I reckon is more a sizable pond than a sea, but who am I to argue with a place that's been around since the dawn of time, or at least since some fish fancied a swim in a slightly bigger puddle? The landscape, you see, is all rolling hills and olive groves, picturesque enough to bore you blind with its tranquility. Every single hill seems to be angling for the best light, so it can show off its meager patch of greenery.

And the villages? Bless their humble hearts, they huddle together like frightened sheep against the vast, indifferent sky. You could fire a cannon through most of them and barely disturb a soul, save maybe a stray dog napping in the shade. Folks tell you, with a straight face, that the air is pure and the water is crystal clear. I wouldn't bet my last dollar on it, though. I tasted some water that claimed to be "straight from the mountain spring," and it tasted like a mountain spring that had recently housed a family of frogs.

Now, I will say this for Galilee: it does have a certain... charm. It's the kind of charm that makes you want to leave within an hour of arriving, but then, in retrospect, it seems almost... romantic. Like a faded photograph of a long-lost love, or a forgotten promise scribbled on a dusty chalkboard. But mostly, it's a place that proves the good Lord has a sense of humor, and that He likes his scenery best when it is a bit dusty and slow. And full of stubborn donkeys, naturally.
