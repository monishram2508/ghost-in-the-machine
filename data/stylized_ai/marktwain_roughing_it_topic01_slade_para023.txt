Slade, now there was a spectacle fit for a sideshow, a human curiosity shipped straight from the infernal regions, if you asked me. They called him a station agent, but I reckon he was more of a glorified gatekeeper to hell itself. Why, the man had eyes like a snake charmer's cobra, never blinking, always sizing you up like you were a prize bull at a county fair. And his disposition? Blacker than a moonless night in a coal mine. He held court in that dusty, fly-blown office of his, surrounded by enough firearms to outfit a small army, and a demeanor that suggested he wouldn't hesitate to use 'em. He was a walking, talking advertisement for the restorative properties of lead poisoning, only it appeared he'd thrived on the stuff.

I heard tell tales about Slade that would make your hair stand on end, and I’ve seen a few sights myself, mind you. Stories of shootouts and stabbings, barroom brawls that left saloons looking like they'd been hit by a tornado. One yarn had him single-handedly holding off a band of road agents, armed with nothing but a bowie knife and a glare that could curdle milk. Now, I ain't one to believe everything I hear, but I will say this: the man possessed a certain… presence. An aura of danger, if you will, that seemed to settle over the town like a dust storm whenever he was around. He was a law unto himself, Slade was, and the only authority higher than him was probably sitting down below, polishing his pitchfork and chuckling to himself. He wasn't a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley, or even a well-lit saloon, for that matter. He made Calamity Jane look like a Sunday school teacher, and Wild Bill Hickok a timid church mouse. Yes sir, Slade was a character, a genuine, unvarnished article, and a testament to the sheer cussedness that the West seemed to breed.
