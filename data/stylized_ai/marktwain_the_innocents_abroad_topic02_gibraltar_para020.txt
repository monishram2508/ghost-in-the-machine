Gibraltar, bless its heart, is a sight to behold, though one might add, a rather *peculiar* sight. Imagine, if you will, a gigantic grey lion couchant in the azure sea, its haunches planted firmly in Spain, and its noble head, well, trying its best to appear British. It's a rock, of course, but not just any rock, mind you. This one has been fought over and fussed about for centuries, a veritable bone of contention between nations with entirely too much time on their hands. One climbs this precipice, huffing and puffing like a steam engine, only to find the views are, admittedly, magnificent. But then, one is immediately accosted by a Barbary ape, a cheeky fellow with more brass than a politician, intent on relieving you of your spectacles, your hat, and possibly your very dignity. They say these apes are the key to Britain holding Gibraltar – if they ever leave, the Union Jack comes down. A curious strategy, I must say. Relying on simians to maintain an empire seems a rather precarious footing upon which to build international relations.

The town itself, nestled at the foot of this geological behemoth, is a curious jumble. One finds red telephone boxes and pubs serving proper English ale, cheek by jowl with tapas bars and shops hawking duty-free perfumes that smell vaguely of regret. The people, ah, the people! They speak a language I can only describe as a bouillabaisse of English, Spanish, and Genoese, seasoned with a dash of pure, unadulterated gibberish. It's a charming chaos, truly, a place where the past refuses to be buried and the present is constantly tripping over it. And the wind, good heavens, the wind! It howls off the Strait of Gibraltar like a banshee with a grudge, threatening to blow one clean into Morocco. But then, perhaps that wouldn't be so bad. At least the apes couldn't get your hat over there. All in all, Gibraltar is an oddity, a geographical anomaly, a historical footnote blown up to epic proportions. It’s a place that leaves you scratching your head and chuckling simultaneously, wondering if you've just experienced a waking dream. And, truth be told, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
