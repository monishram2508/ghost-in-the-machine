Ballou, now there's a specimen for you, a study in misplaced enthusiasm and a talent for the utterly absurd. He arrived in Nevada with a trunk full of law books and a head full of courtroom dramas, expecting to single-handedly bring order and justice to the Wild West. Bless his heart, he did try. Saw him once, pacing back and forth in front of a saloon, declaiming Blackstone to a hitching post and a couple of disinterested burros. They seemed more captivated by the flies, mind you. He figured to be the next Daniel Webster, I reckon, only Daniel Webster knew when to fold 'em. Ballou, he'd double down on a pair of twos against a royal flush, guaranteed.

He had a way of attracting trouble, too. Not the kind where you end up in a gunfight at high noon, mind you, more the kind where you're arguing over the correct pronunciation of "habeas corpus" with a grizzly bear who'd wandered into town for a drink. And he never learned, not him. You'd see him the next day, dusting off his frock coat and ready to tackle another case, convinced he was one good argument away from converting the whole territory to temperance and good grammar. I remember him trying to defend a claim-jumper who'd been caught red-handed. He went on and on about the sanctity of property rights, only to have the judge, a fellow who looked like he’d been carved from a sequoia log, interrupt with, "Sanctity, you say? Well, the sanctity of *my* nap is about to be violated if you don't wrap this up quick!" Ballou, undeterred, simply raised his voice and launched into a particularly convoluted point about riparian rights, until the judge declared him in contempt and sentenced him to clean out the courthouse spittoons for a week. That's Ballou in a nutshell - earnest, misguided, and generally a whole lot funnier than he ever intended to be. A man who could argue the bark off a tree, and then be surprised when it didn't sprout legal briefs.
