The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a Christian restorationist church founded by Joseph Smith in the United States in 1830. It's a faith rooted in unique scriptures that supplement the Bible, including the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price. These texts, believed to be divinely inspired, detail the history of ancient American civilizations and provide further guidance on faith and practice. At the core of Mormon theology is the belief that the Church of Jesus Christ was lost after the death of the apostles and subsequently restored through Joseph Smith, who received revelations and translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates. Members emphasize the importance of Jesus Christ as their Savior and Redeemer, adhering to principles of faith, repentance, baptism by immersion, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands.

A key element of Mormon belief is the concept of eternal families, teaching that familial relationships can continue beyond death through temple sealings. Temples are sacred structures distinct from meetinghouses, serving as places for performing ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, endowments, and sealings. Missionary work plays a significant role in the Church, with young men and women often dedicating one to two years of their lives to serving full-time missions, proselytizing and performing service in various parts of the world. The Church emphasizes community, family values, and personal righteousness. Members adhere to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which discourages the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. The Church's organizational structure is hierarchical, led by a prophet and apostles. It operates a vast network of welfare programs, educational institutions, and humanitarian aid initiatives worldwide. While facing historical and contemporary scrutiny regarding its early practices and doctrinal differences from traditional Christianity, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown into a global faith with millions of members across the globe, contributing significantly to various aspects of society.
