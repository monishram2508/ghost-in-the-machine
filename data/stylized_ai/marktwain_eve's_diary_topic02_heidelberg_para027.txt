Heidelberg, bless its heart, is a town that knows how to pose. It's situated on the Neckar, a river so charmingly green it almost seems painted, and backed by hills crowned with a ruin that would make even a ghost long for the good old days of rampaging and roasting. That castle, mind you, is the main attraction, a magnificent wreck that seems to have exploded in slow motion, leaving behind a delightful jumble of turrets and shattered walls just begging to be photographed. One can climb up there, puffing and panting all the way, and find themselves surrounded by German tourists and Japanese photographers, all clicking away as if they might capture the ghost of Frederick V in their lenses. Down below, the town itself is a charming little warren of cobblestone streets, filled with shops selling cuckoo clocks and leather lederhosen to tourists eager to embrace their inner Bavarian. 

And oh, the students! They swarm the streets like bees to honey, their faces bright with youth and their pockets conveniently empty. They fill the Kneipen, singing beer-soaked songs and arguing about philosophy with the fervor only a young German can muster. One observes them and wonders if they're truly concerned with weighty matters, or merely putting on a show for the benefit of the impressionable young ladies who cluster around them. It's a grand old show, of course, and one suspects it's been playing in Heidelberg for centuries, with only minor adjustments to the costumes and the dialogue. 

The overall effect, if I may say so, is one of studied romanticism. Heidelberg is a place that exists, perhaps, more in the imagination than in reality. It's a carefully constructed stage set, designed to evoke feelings of nostalgia and wonder, even if you're not quite sure what you're nostalgic *for*. It is a charmingly fake, but in that fakeness resides much of its beauty. One visits, one snaps a few pictures, one perhaps buys a cuckoo clock as proof of the visit, and one departs, feeling like one has participated in a delightful and slightly absurd theatrical production. And who can resist a good, slightly absurd theatrical production? Not I, certainly.
