Genoa, now there's a city that'll give your senses a right proper clatter, like a cymbal player gone mad with the percussion. Imagine, if you will, a place where the buildings are stacked taller than a sailor's yarn, squeezed tighter than a miser's fist around a gold sovereign, and painted in colours that would make a rainbow blush. Why, they're all crammed cheek-to-jowl, as if each were desperately trying to eavesdrop on its neighbour's secrets, these buildings. You can scarcely swing a cat without knocking over a geranium pot or landing yourself in the lap of a dour-faced Genoese woman selling pesto, and heavens knows, you wouldn’t want to provoke her temper. The streets? Well, they’re a labyrinth designed, one suspects, by a committee of particularly mischievous gremlins. So narrow are some of them that one might reach out and shake hands with the fellow across the way, assuming said fellow wasn't already occupied battling his way through a gaggle of tourists clutching gelato and maps turned every which way but loose. 

The harbour, ah, the harbour! A lively, bustling affair, teeming with ships of all shapes and sizes, from sleek yachts to rusty old tubs that look like they’ve seen more sea battles than Nelson himself. Sailors swagger about, their voices thick with the salt of the sea and tales of faraway lands, all vying for your attention and a generous tip, naturally. The air itself hums with the clamour of commerce, the shouts of vendors hawking their wares, and the mournful wail of seagulls lamenting the loss of a dropped crumb. And the food, my word, the food! Pesto, of course, reigns supreme, but there are also focaccia flatbreads drizzled with olive oil and rosemary, and enough seafood to populate Neptune's kingdom. One could easily spend a lifetime exploring Genoa's crooked alleys, sampling its culinary delights, and listening to the outlandish stories spun by its seafaring folk, and still only scratch the surface of its peculiar charm. But mind you, watch your pockets, for Genoa, like any city with a long and storied history, has its share of rogues and rascals eager to lighten your load with practiced ease.
