Well, I swan, Lucerne. It's a town plumped right down smack on the edge of a lake so blue it could shame a peacock’s tail, and surrounded by mountains that seem to think they're taller than they really are. Pretentious peaks, if you ask me, but the sort that do lend a certain picturesque something to the scenery, like a well-placed ruffle on a dame's Sunday-go-to-meeting dress. The river Reuss cuts through the town like a clever little serpent, all aquiver with reflections of gingerbread houses and tourists snapping photographs with contraptions that look suspiciously like miniature magic lanterns. Now, these tourists, they're a peculiar breed, all bundled up in woollies regardless of the season, clutching maps bigger than bedsheets, and speaking in tongues that would make a Pentecostal preacher blush. They wander about, peering at the Chapel Bridge, a covered monstrosity festooned with paintings that depict historical events so dull they could cure insomnia quicker than laudanum. It's supposed to be ancient and important, that bridge, but to my eye, it's just a glorified shed with a leaky roof. Still, folks seem to get a powerful kick out of it. The Lion Monument, carved into a cliff face, is another head-scratcher. It's a mournful lion, perpetually dying, supposedly commemorating some Swiss guards who got themselves killed defending the French King. Seems to me, it’s a rather expensive way to weep over spilled milk, but there you have it; Europeans do love their monuments, even when they're as gloomy as a tax collector on a rainy Tuesday. As for the town itself, well, it's clean as a hound's tooth and tidy enough to make a spinster sigh with envy. Shops overflow with cuckoo clocks, Swiss Army knives, and chocolate that melts in your mouth faster than a politician’s promise. All in all, Lucerne is a pretty enough place, but give me a good ol' Mississippi mud puddle and a banjo any day. At least then, things are honest about being messy.
