Ah, the portier, that fellow stationed at the grand front door, a sort of human doorknocker, only considerably more judgmental. One might fancy him a pillar of propriety, observing the comings and goings of the world from his perch, but I suspect his true fascination lies in deciphering the social standing of each unfortunate soul that dares to approach. He’s a curious specimen, the portier, often padded about the midriff as if harboring a colony of disgruntled pigeons, and sporting a uniform so laden with braid it could likely support a small sailing vessel. He regards the swells and the snobs with a practiced obsequiousness, bending low enough to examine the quality of their boot-blacking, while offering a curt nod – hardly a bow, mind you – to those who haven’t quite managed to secure their place in the gilded cage.

It's rumored the portier possesses an uncanny ability to sniff out scandal and impropriety from a block away, like a truffle hound for secrets. He likely maintains a mental ledger of assignations and indiscretions, a veritable chronicle of the foolishness of humankind, all filed neatly in the gray matter beneath his peaked cap. And yet, he remains maddeningly silent, the secrets locked away like prize-winning pickles in a hermetically sealed jar. What tales he could tell, this silent sentinel! What delicious gossip he could peddle! But no, he stands there, a monument to discretion, an impenetrable fortress of stoicism, broken only by the occasional rustle of his starched collar and the barely perceptible flicker of amusement in his eye when a particularly flamboyant scandal finally bursts forth. One does wonder, though, whether he ever dreams of chucking it all, of trading the grand entrance for a quiet life tending bees, where the only judging required is determining which flower yields the sweetest honey. But then again, perhaps the honey of scandal is simply too potent to resist.
