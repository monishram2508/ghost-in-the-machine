Now, Damascus, that ancient hussy of a city, she’s seen a thing or two, I tell you. Why, Methuselah himself probably bought figs from a street vendor there. You stroll through her souks, those twisting labyrinths of commerce, and you’re practically tripping over history, though mind you watch your step, as more than likely you’ll trip over a mangy cat or a pile of discarded orange peels. The air hangs thick as pea soup, a blend of spices that could wake the dead, donkey sweat, and the incessant bleating of hawkers peddling their wares. And those wares! Silks shimmering like captured moonlight, copper pots gleaming like a miser’s smile, and enough spices to flavor the entire Ottoman Empire thrice over. You could buy a carpet that whispers secrets of forgotten sultans, or a trinket that’s seen more action than a Mississippi steamboat in a card game.

But don’t go expecting any kind of organized queue, mind you. They’ve got a system there, alright, but it seems to involve a liberal application of elbows, a complete disregard for personal space, and a vocal range that could shatter glass. Bartering is a blood sport, you see, a dance of wits where the buyer pretends to be appalled by the price and the seller pretends to be insulted by the offer. It’s all theater, of course, and you’re expected to play your part. Just be sure to keep a twinkle in your eye and a ready smile, and maybe you'll come out of it only slightly fleeced. And the water! Ah, the water of Damascus, so pure, so cold, so… well, let’s just say I preferred to stick to the questionable lemonade. You know, for hygiene’s sake. Though, if I’m honest, I half suspected that lemonade was brewed with water scooped straight from the Barada River. Still, a man’s gotta take his chances, and besides, what’s a little dysentery when you’re exploring the cradle of civilization? It’s character-building, I tell you.
