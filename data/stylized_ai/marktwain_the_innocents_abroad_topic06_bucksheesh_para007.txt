Now, about this bucksheesh, this grease that oils the wheels of the Orient, this persuader of doorkeepers and expediter of dusty permits – a body might call it bribery, and some do, those with a prissy distaste for reality, but I reckon a bribe suggests something untoward, something against the natural order. Bucksheesh, though, is more like rain. It falls on the just and the unjust, the lazy and the industrious, the rich and, especially, the poor. It’s just there, part of the landscape, like sandstorms and donkey carts. Try navigating the streets of Cairo without a little bucksheesh for the fellah guarding the gate. He’ll see you standing there, sweating like a hog in July, and he’ll stroke his beard, look right through you, and commence to contemplate the mysteries of the universe. But a piaster or two slipped into his palm? Why, suddenly he remembers he has a cousin who’s just arrived from Alexandria and needs directions, and that cousin, wouldn't you know it, just happens to be standing right next to you. And then, presto, the gate swings open!

You see it everywhere, this quiet lubrication. The waiter in Constantinople who can’t seem to find your coffee until your hand dips into your pocket; the customs agent in Port Said who finds your luggage remarkably free of contraband after a small, shall we say, “voluntary contribution” to his retirement fund. It ain’t precisely theft, mind you. It's more a system of supplementary wages, a way for the common man to get a piece of the pie, or at least a crumb or two that fell off the table. And let's be honest, a body can’t fault a man for trying to feed his family, especially when his government seems more interested in feeding itself. Why, I even saw an American missionary, bless his earnest soul, slipping a little something to the dragoman just to ensure his donkey didn’t mysteriously develop a limp halfway to the pyramids. He called it “encouragement,” but I recognized the glint in his eye. It's a universal language, bucksheesh, spoken fluently in every corner of the globe, though nowhere with quite the same art and candor as in the lands of the East.
