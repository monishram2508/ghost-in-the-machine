Now, this Coliseum, bless its heart, is a spectacle and a ruin, all rolled into one grand, dusty package, a sort of ancient, slightly crazed, circus tent made of stone. They tell you, the guides do, with their earnest faces and well-worn spiels, that emperors and gladiators once cavorted within these very walls, engaging in all sorts of unsavory amusements. Lions roared, men bled, and the Roman populace, bless their barbaric souls, cheered with gusto. Imagine that! Why, it's enough to give a modern American a touch of the vapors, what with all the talk of mortal combat. You can almost hear the echoes of those ancient roars, though I reckon it's probably just the wind whistling through the crumbling arches these days. 

And the size of it! Why, a man could get lost in there for days, dodging pigeons and tripping over stray bits of marble. One can’t help but wonder if the original architects ever considered the practicalities of cleaning up after a particularly boisterous lion fight. I suspect they left that particular task to the lower classes, a thought which brings to mind the eternal problem of societal inequality, but I digress. The tourists flock to it, naturally, cameras snapping like locusts at a picnic. They crane their necks and squint, trying to conjure up images of gladiatorial glory, probably imagining themselves as Russell Crowe in that motion picture, the lot of 'em. The place is quite a curiosity, mind you, and a testament to the Romans' predilection for grand gestures and a distinct lack of interior decorating skills. One might say the Colosseum is a rather imposing pile of rocks, evidence of a civilization both magnificent and monstrous. And, of course, overpriced gelato is readily available just outside, catering to those seeking a more palatable taste of Rome's grandeur.
