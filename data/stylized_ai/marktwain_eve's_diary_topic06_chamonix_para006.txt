Chamonix, they call it, a place where the mountains poke at the heavens with such impertinent audacity you half expect a thunderclap to swat them back down to size. Now, I've seen hills before, back in my day, little humps that a self-respecting mole could conquer in an afternoon. But these… these are not hills. These are geological show-offs, draped in so much ice and snow they resemble a chorus line of glaciers in a particularly sparkly revue. The village itself, nestled at their feet like a respectful, if somewhat overwhelmed, audience, is a curious affair. Chalets that look for all the world like gingerbread houses for giants elbow each other for space, their balconies practically daring you to lean over and take a swan dive into the bustling street below. Speaking of bustle, the tourists flock here like moths to a particularly bright lantern, chattering away in a dozen different tongues about "vert," "crampons," and other alarming words best left to the lexicon of lunatics. They arrive swaddled in more layers than an onion, brandishing ski poles with a fervor usually reserved for crusades, and disappear into the snowy wilderness, only to reappear later, looking either exhilarated beyond measure or slightly traumatized, depending, I suspect, on whether they spent the day upright or doing a passable imitation of a human snowplow. And the food! Oh, the food. Cheese. So much cheese. Fondue that could glue a small country together, raclette that melts your very soul, and cheeses so pungent they could knock a badger unconscious at fifty paces. One is left to wonder if the air itself doesn't have a faint cheesy aroma, a subtle yet persistent reminder that one is, indeed, in the land of dairy dominion. All in all, Chamonix is an experience, a spectacle, a place where nature flaunts its magnificence and humanity responds by throwing money at it and wearing unflattering ski pants. One leaves slightly breathless, slightly poorer, and with a distinct feeling that one has just witnessed something truly and utterly ridiculous... in the best possible way, of course.
