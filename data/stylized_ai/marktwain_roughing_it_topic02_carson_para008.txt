Well, Carson City. Lord have mercy, that town. You wouldn't believe the dust devils dance jigs in the streets like drunken miners chasing after a stray dollar. I reckon if a jackrabbit sneezed just right, it could bury the whole darn place under a layer of silt thicker than a preacher's Sunday sermon. And the legislature? Bless their hearts, they were a sight to behold. More like a flock of hens peckin' at seeds of wisdom, only half-digesting 'em and squawking nonsense for the rest of the day. You'd swear they were debatatin' whether the sky was blue or if someone had just spilled a bucket of indigo paint up there. I saw one fella, a senator if you can believe it, try to argue that a cow could fly, if given a strong enough gust of wind and enough beer to embolden it.

The hotels, oh, the hotels were something special. You could practically hear the bedbugs sharpening their tiny little forks and knives each night, ready for a feast. And the water? Well, it tasted like it had been strained through a miner's boot and left to simmer in the Nevada sun for a week. Strong enough to curl your hair and make you reconsider your life choices. But you know, despite all its quirks and eccentricities, Carson had a certain charm to it. It was rough around the edges, sure, like a diamond straight from the mine, but it was honest. What you saw was what you got: a dusty, loud, and slightly lawless town where fortunes were made and lost, and where a man could always find a good game of poker and a tall tale to swap. It was a place that didn’t pretend to be anything it wasn’t, and maybe that’s why I found myself strangely drawn to the place, like a moth to a flickering kerosene lamp, even with the risk of getting burned.
