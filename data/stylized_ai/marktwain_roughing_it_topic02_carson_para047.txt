Carson, bless its heart, ain't exactly a garden party, no sir. Why, I’ve seen tumbleweeds there that looked more lively and ambitious than half the folks milling about. They call it the capital of Nevada, which, frankly, is like calling a jackrabbit the king of beasts. There’s a courthouse, of course, because where there are folks, there are bound to be grievances, and where there are grievances, there are lawyers itching to untangle 'em. Then there's the Governor's mansion, a rather respectable pile of bricks that looks perpetually surprised to find itself in such a dusty, sun-baked locale. The saloons are… well, they’re saloons. No shortage of whiskey, sawdust on the floor, and tales taller than a pine tree, mostly dealing with silver strikes and fortunes made (and lost) quicker than a gambler can flip a card.

The air itself is a peculiar thing, smelling vaguely of sagebrush and disappointment, seasoned with a pinch of optimism held over from the Comstock days. You'll meet fellows there who swear blind they're just one claim away from being richer than Croesus, and others who look like they've been chewing on gravel for a decade, and probably have. Society’s a bit… relaxed, shall we say. You could probably walk down the main street wearing nothing but a hat and a pair of chaps, and nobody would bat an eye, though they might suggest you grease yourself up a bit, to avoid sunstroke. Truth be told, Carson's got a certain charm, a rough-and-tumble honesty that you just can't find back East. It's a place where fortunes are fleeting, dreams are plentiful, and the only thing more common than dust is the unwavering belief that tomorrow will be different. Whether it will or not, well, that's a story best left to be told over a bottle of something strong in one of those aforementioned saloons. Just don't bet the farm on it.
