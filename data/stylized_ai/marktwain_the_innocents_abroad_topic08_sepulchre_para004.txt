Now, a sepulchre, you see, is just a fancy, high-toned word for a grave, but it carries a certain weight, a theatrical flair, that your common, garden-variety hole in the ground just can't muster. It's the sort of thing folks build when they want to make a statement, long after they're gone and in no position to appreciate it. I reckon they think the Almighty, bless His heart, keeps tabs on the grandeur of our earthly remains and grades us accordingly when we show up on the other side. Probably gives extra credit for pyramid schemes and elaborate mausoleums, though I wouldn't put it past Him to be partial to a simple, honest grave with a few wildflowers stuck in a Mason jar.

I've seen sepulchres that look like small banks, all granite and stern pronouncements about eternal rest, as if they were daring the undertaker to pocket the silver fillings. Others are like miniature Grecian temples, complete with stoic-looking cherubs and enough marble to pave a small city. Makes you wonder if the dearly departed wasn't just a little bit vain, even in death. You can almost hear them whispering, "Look at me, still impressing folks even when I'm nothing but dust and bones!" And then there are the cryptic inscriptions, usually in Latin, which, let's be honest, nobody understands anymore except maybe a few dusty professors who spend their days deciphering dead languages. It's all a bit of a sham, really, meant to intimidate and impress. But underneath all the stone and pomp, it's still just a place where a body rots, same as in any ditch. The worms don't care if it's a sepulchre or a pauper's grave; they're just happy to have dinner. And that, my friends, is the great leveler. Death comes for us all, grand sepulchre or not, and turns us into a feast for the earth. So, best to focus on living a life worth remembering, rather than spending all your coin on a fancy box to lie in. Unless, of course, you really, *really* like the idea of impressing those worms.
