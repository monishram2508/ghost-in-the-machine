Now, pard, this pardner I’m about to lay before you, he was a specimen. Not one of them fancy Eastern types, mind you, all starch and sensibilities. No sir. This fella, we called him “Dusty” mostly ‘cause he looked like he’d been dipped head-first into a flour sack and then run through a tumbleweed convention. Dusty wasn’t much for conversation, but he made up for it in sheer stubbornness. You could argue with a mule until the sun surrendered to the moon, and you’d still have better luck persuading that four-legged jackass than convincing Dusty that the sky warn’t green or that panning for gold in a dry gulch was a mite unproductive. He just had this set way of looking at the world, like he’d already decided what the answer was before you even asked the question.

I reckon Dusty was what you might call “economical” with the truth. Not a liar, precisely, but inclined to embellish. If he caught a trout the size of a minnow, it became a salmon by suppertime. If he saw a rattlesnake, it blossomed into a boa constrictor with a Napoleon complex. And his stories about near-death experiences? Well, I swear, the man had been buried alive, mauled by bears, and chased by angry Apache warriors more times than Methuselah had hot dinners. I always figured he was just trying to add some color to his life, ‘cause truth be told, Dusty’s days mostly consisted of spitting tobacco juice, arguing with rocks, and muttering about finding a lost vein of silver so rich it’d make Croesus blush. Still, he was good company, in a peculiar, quiet sort of way. A man could always rely on Dusty to hold his tongue, mostly 'cause his tongue was usually occupied with a wad of chewing tobacco the size of a squirrel. And you had to admire his tenacity. Even when the odds were stacked against him – which, let’s be honest, was most of the time – Dusty would just keep on chugging along, convinced that tomorrow, maybe just maybe, he'd finally strike it rich. Or at least, find a slightly bigger trout.
