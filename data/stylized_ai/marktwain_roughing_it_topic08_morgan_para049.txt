Now, about this feller Morgan, a specimen I encountered out west – not the pirate-y kind, mind you, but just as elusive and prone to sudden vanishings. He was a prospector, or claimed to be, which is a distinction about as fine as a gnat’s whisker. Said he was chasing the mother lode up near Hangtown, a place aptly named, I’d say, considering the characters you’d find swinging around its saloons. Morgan was a study in contradictions, like a preacher who enjoys a nip too much or a banker who’s a whiz at poker. He dressed like he'd wrestled a bear and lost – threadbare clothes, patched with more ambition than skill, and a hat that looked like it’d been used to pan for gold and then forgotten. Yet, beneath that rugged exterior, he possessed a certain… eloquence, if you can call it that. He could spin a yarn about a vein of gold so rich it’d blind a rattlesnake, and do it with the conviction of a revival preacher. Of course, whether that yarn was true was another matter entirely.

He carried a pickaxe with a handle worn smooth from years of… well, leaning on it, mostly. And a mule named Bess, who possessed more sense than Morgan himself, I reckon. Bess, she’d dig in her heels at the slightest hint of fool’s gold, while Morgan would be off whooping and hollering about his find. It was a sight to behold, the two of them, a comedy of errors played out against the backdrop of the Sierra Nevada. Some said he was a fool, chasing dreams in a land already picked clean. Others whispered he knew something they didn't, a secret map tucked away in his ratty waistcoat. Me? I figured he was just having a grand old time, living a story more interesting than any gold could buy, even if it was a story mostly fabricated in his own head. And out west, that counts for something, wouldn’t you agree? More than likely, though, he's probably off chasing a rainbow made of whiskey fumes, and Bess is leading him right into a cactus patch. Serves 'em both right.
