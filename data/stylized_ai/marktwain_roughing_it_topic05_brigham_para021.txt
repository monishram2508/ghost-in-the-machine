Brigham, now there was a fellow. A regular Moses, if Moses had a weakness for wives and a head for business. They called him a prophet, these Mormons, and I reckon he prophesied alright – prophesied a whole dang empire right out of the barren desert. Salt Lake City, a garden blooming where sagebrush held court, all thanks to Brigham’s stubborn vision and a river diverted with a shovel and a prayer, or something mighty similar. Mind you, I’d wager the prayer was mostly aimed at keeping his flock from splintering off again, like a rotten fence post in a windstorm. He was a practical man, Brigham, a man who understood that faith was fine for Sundays, but a good irrigation system was what kept the bellies full come Monday. He built schools, and theaters, and tithing offices overflowing with the harvest of his devoted. Some whispered about the inner workings of the Endowment House, tales that'd curl your whiskers and make even the devil blush, but Brigham, he just puffed on his pipe and looked the other way. He was a shrewd customer, that Brigham, playing politics like a virtuoso fiddler, keeping the federal government at arm's length while holding his little kingdom tight. And wives? Why, he had more wives than a centipede has legs, or so they said. Though I suspect the number got a bit exaggerated over campfire whiskey and tall tales. Still, it gave the gossips plenty to chew on, and Brigham, he just kept building, kept planning, kept making that desert bloom like a rose, even if it was a rose with a few too many thorns hidden beneath the petals. A peculiar fellow, Brigham, a force of nature wrapped in a plain suit and a steely gaze, a man who, whether you agreed with his methods or not, certainly left his mark on this here landscape. And likely, in the record books as well!
