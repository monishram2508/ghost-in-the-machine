The Neckar, bless its heart, is a river. A perfectly amiable river, mind you, if a bit too fond of snaking about the landscape like a tipsy uncle at a wedding. One might accuse it of indecision, really, what with all the looping and twirling. It clearly hasn't made up its mind where it's heading, though I suppose its destination – the Rhine, that great, blustering bully of a river – is preordained. Still, a little commitment wouldn’t hurt, would it? I watched it the other day, lazing under the Heidelberg bridge (a bridge, by the way, that looks as if it’s been caught mid-yawn), and it struck me as a river perfectly content to be picturesque. Not that I blame it, mind you. The hills that hug it are plastered with vineyards, looking for all the world like green carpets haphazardly thrown over rumpled furniture. And the towns that perch on its banks! Each one vying for the title of ‘Most Charmingly Medieval,’ which is a contest about as useful as a screen door on a submarine, but ever so delightful to observe.

The Neckar, then, is the sort of river you’d expect to find serenaded by lutenists, had lutenists not gone the way of the dodo. These days, it's more likely to be serenaded by the chugging of tour boats packed with wide-eyed Americans, all snapping photographs as if they expect the river to disappear if they don't capture it on film. Which, I suppose, is a testament to its beauty. It certainly isn’t a river that threatens or inspires awe. It’s not a Mississippi, roaring with ambition, nor a Nile, thick with ancient secrets. No, the Neckar is a quiet river, a contemplative river, a river perfectly content to mirror the clouds and the occasional swan, and to occasionally deliver a load of barge-borne goods to somewhere or another. A river that asks nothing of you, save that you admire its scenery and perhaps buy a bottle of Riesling grown on its sun-drenched slopes. A modest request, surely, for such an obligingly pretty stretch of water.
