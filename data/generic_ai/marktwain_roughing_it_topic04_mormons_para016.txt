The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, emerged in the 19th century in the United States from the religious experiences of Joseph Smith. Smith, who claimed to receive divine revelations, published the Book of Mormon, which members consider scripture alongside the Bible. The Book of Mormon narrates the story of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. This narrative, coupled with other revelations Smith received, formed the foundation of a new religious movement that emphasized a restored gospel, believing that the Christian church had deviated from its original teachings. Early Mormons faced significant persecution, driven by their unconventional beliefs, including polygamy (which was later officially abandoned), and their concentrated communal living. This persecution led to a westward migration, eventually settling in the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah under the leadership of Brigham Young.

Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a global religion with millions of members worldwide. It retains a strong emphasis on family values, community involvement, and missionary work. Young members, both men and women, are encouraged to serve full-time missions, often for two years, proselytizing and providing humanitarian aid in diverse locations around the world. Mormon theology emphasizes the importance of temples, where sacred ordinances, including baptisms for the dead and eternal marriage sealings, are performed. These ordinances are believed to extend salvation to deceased ancestors and bind families together eternally. The church operates extensive welfare programs to assist members in need and promotes principles of self-reliance, thrift, and hard work. While holding firmly to their unique doctrinal beliefs, the Church actively participates in interfaith dialogues and seeks to build bridges with other religious communities. They emphasize living Christ-centered lives and striving for personal righteousness, contributing to a broader narrative of faith, community, and service that distinguishes them in the landscape of modern Christianity.
