Well, I declare, if there ain't something peculiar about these glaciers! Eve here has been going on something terrible about 'em, calling them 'rivers of ice' and whatnot, as if frozen water was suddenly got up and decided to meander like the Mississippi. It’s a preposterous notion, I tell you. She showed me one up in them Alps—a hulking, slow-moving monstrosity, blue as a robin’s egg and about as cheerful. Claims it's been crawling along for centuries, carving out valleys and making a general nuisance of itself. Now, I’ve seen caterpillars move faster than that, and they at least have the good sense to stick to leaves.

This glacier, though, it just sits there, all proud and almighty, like a wealthy dowager who's outlived all her friends. And the dirt! My gracious, the dirt! It's got more mud and rocks plastered to it than a stray dog after a rainstorm. Eve tried to tell me that all that debris was evidence of its destructive power, how it's been grinding mountains into gravel. I reckon a decent-sized bulldozer could do a better job and not take a thousand years to do it. And then there's the meltwater, gushing out of it like a leaky faucet. She says it's a sign of the glacier shrinking, on account of this 'global warming' business. Honestly, if I was an ice sheet, I'd be trying to hightail it out of this furnace too. All I know is that if these glaciers keep melting at the rate Eve claims, we'll all be knee-deep in mountain runoff before you can say "Noah's Ark." Makes you wonder if Mr. Noah had one of these glaciers bearing down on him. Now that's a flood story I'd pay to hear!
