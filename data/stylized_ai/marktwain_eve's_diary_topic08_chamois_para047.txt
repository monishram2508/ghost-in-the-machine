Now, about these chamois creatures. Droll little fellows, they are, perched up on those confounded Alps like ornaments on a wedding cake crafted by a dyspeptic baker. One minute they're a blur of brown, leaping across a chasm that'd give an angel vertigo, and the next they're frozen still as a marble statue, chewing their cud and gazing down upon us mortals as if we were particularly uninteresting beetles. They’re vain creatures, I suspect, admiring themselves in the reflected shimmer of glacial lakes. And their horns! Those curled black things look for all the world like a gentleman's mustache gone awry, twisted and pointed towards the heavens. I have seen them tangled in the branches of stunted pines, looking quite put out, I assure you, like a debutante caught with her hair in curlers.

The mountain men, bless their simple hearts, are forever chasing after them, lured by the promise of soft leather for gloves that’ll never quite keep the frostbite at bay. They stalk about with rifles longer than their legs, puffing and panting and muttering about the 'wily chamois,' as if the creature were in league with Beelzebub himself. More likely, the chamois is just better at skipping over treacherous terrain, what with its dainty little hooves and all. It occurs to me that if I were forced to live on a diet of rocks and snow, I too would be extraordinarily motivated to avoid being shot. One wonders what the chamois think of us, with our ridiculous hats and our noisy contraptions. Perhaps they laugh, echoing through the silent valleys, a sound lost to all but the most perceptive ear. I daresay, if they could write, they’d pen a far more amusing account of our follies than anything you’d find in those dry, scientific tomes. Yes, indeed, the chamois, a curious conundrum wrapped in brown fur, a comedian of the crags, a testament to the absurdity of existence, and a right fine source of glove leather besides.
