Now, these Bedouins, mind you, are not your garden-variety fellows you’d find sipping lemonade on a veranda. Bless their sun-baked hides, they are as different from civilized folk as a camel is from a canary. They’re the genuine article, roaming the Arabian desert with a devil-may-care attitude that would make a Mississippi riverboat gambler blush. I reckon a fellow could spend a lifetime observing them and still not quite grasp their ways. They’re a hardy bunch, these Bedouins, tough as saddle leather and about as pliable. They live in tents, which they move hither and yon, like a traveling circus with a distinct lack of clowns. And the dust! Good heavens, the dust! It’s everywhere, clinging to everything like a persistent salesman. One wonders if they even notice it anymore, or if it just becomes part of the furniture, so to speak.

They’ve got these magnificent horses, sleek as a politician’s promise, and camels that could win a staring contest with a sphinx. The camels, I suspect, are constantly judging us outsiders, and not in a favorable light, either. And their hospitality! Now that’s something to write home about, even if home is a dusty corner of the desert itself. They'll offer you dates and bitter coffee that could wake the dead, and expect nothing in return but perhaps a yarn or two and a healthy dose of respect. Of course, their notions of personal space are somewhat…expansive. One might find oneself practically sharing a toothbrush with a complete stranger, which, I assure you, is an experience. Their dialect, well, it's a peculiar thing, a collection of guttural sounds and expressive gestures that could launch a thousand debates at a linguistics convention. I'd wager that even a seasoned polyglot would find himself utterly lost in a conversation with a Bedouin elder. All in all, a singular people, these Bedouins; a blend of hardiness, hospitality, and utter bewilderment for the ways of us citified folk. One might just learn a thing or two from them, even if it's just how to squint properly into the sun.
