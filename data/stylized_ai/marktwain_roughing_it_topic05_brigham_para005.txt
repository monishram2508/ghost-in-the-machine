Brigham, ah yes, Brigham. A name that resonates like a struck anvil in these here Mormon lands, a name whispered with reverence and, I suspect, a healthy dose of fear, even now that he’s kicked the bucket and gone to that great celestial choir practice in the sky. Folks claim he was a prophet, ordained by divine appointment, and I ain't one to dispute divine appointments, especially not when staring down the barrel of a Colt revolver. But I saw Brigham once, up close, during the laying of the cornerstone for the Perpetual Emigrating Fund office. He was a stout fella, built more like a blacksmith than a Sunday school teacher, with a face that could curdle milk at fifty paces. He surveyed the crowd, this grand patriarch of a burgeoning kingdom, and I swear he looked like he was calculating how many wives he could fit in that there building.

He had a way of talking, too, slow and deliberate, each word like a carefully placed stone in a dam. You could practically see the doctrine pouring forth, shaping the landscape of their lives. Some said he was a master orator, capable of turning a sow's ear into a silk purse with the sheer force of his rhetoric. Others claimed it was just the hypnotizing effect of his beard – a veritable thicket of gray authority that could make a man believe the moon was made of green cheese. 

But regardless of his methods, there was no denying his power. He ran this territory like a benevolent despot, a father figure with a whip hand. He built roads, established settlements, and kept the Indians at bay, which, let me tell you, is no small feat. He was a shrewd businessman, too, accumulating wealth like a squirrel stockpiling nuts for a long winter. Some said he kept the best pick of everything for himself, but then again, what good is being a prophet if you can't enjoy the spoils? Brigham, he was a character, alright. A scoundrel, a saint, a builder, a believer, and everything in between. A true Western enigma, like a mirage shimmering in the desert, promising water where there's only sand.
