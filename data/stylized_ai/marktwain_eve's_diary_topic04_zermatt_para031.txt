Zermatt, you say? A village clinging to the Swiss Alps like a particularly tenacious tick on a Saint Bernard, and boasting, as all these mountain hamlets do, of its unparalleled "charm." One suspects "charm" in this case translates to "an utter inability to accommodate anything larger than a goat-drawn cart." Indeed, the absence of automobiles is hailed as a virtue, though I suspect this is largely because the streets are scarcely wider than my own hallway, and even a spirited mule might find itself wedged betwixt the chalets. The air, I must grant, is remarkably crisp, owing perhaps to the altitude or the sheer terror of slipping on the cobblestones, which appear to be laid out by a drunken giant with a penchant for obstacle courses. One finds oneself gasping, though whether from exertion or the price of a cup of coffee, is a matter for philosophical debate. And then there's the Matterhorn, that majestic shard of rock that dominates the landscape. It is, undeniably, impressive. Though I couldn’t help but feel that the local merchants, like vultures eyeing a particularly delectable carrion, were counting the francs it generates from tourist postcard sales. It is a majestic mountain, yes, but so persistent in its looming presence that one almost longs for a good, old-fashioned fog to obscure it for a while. The restaurants, oh, the restaurants! Fondue, raclette, rösti – enough cheese to suffocate a regiment of dairymaids. One begins to suspect the Swiss have a secret pact with the cows: "We will glorify your mammary output, and you will never hold us accountable for the caloric consequences." And the tourists, bless their cotton socks! They flock to Zermatt in droves, clad in brightly colored ski suits, snapping photographs with an enthusiasm that suggests they believe the Matterhorn is about to vanish at any moment. They are a merry lot, these skiers and hikers, their faces flushed with sun and exertion, their pockets lighter by several hundred francs. One almost envies their temporary delusion that a week amongst the snow-capped peaks can cure all ills, though I suspect the real cure lies in a healthy dose of cynicism and a stiff drink back down in the valley.
