Lucerne, you see, is one of those places that just pretends to be serious, like a cat eyeing a canary while pretending to be utterly absorbed in washing its face. It sits there, all smug and picturesque, nestled around its lake like a queen swaddled in ermine, bragging about its history and its Lion Monument carved into the blasted rock. Why, I swear that lion looks perpetually surprised, as if he’d just overheard the city fathers plotting to raise taxes again. And the Chapel Bridge, that painted toothpick affair stretched across the Reuss – well, it’s pretty enough, I grant you, with its little triangles of history dangling overhead. But let's be honest, it's also rather drafty and overrun with tourists wielding cameras like weapons. They stalk the bridge, these visitors, snapping away as if the very soul of Switzerland might evaporate if unphotographed. One imagines they return home, show their pictures to friends, and then promptly forget which Swiss city was which, anyway. The whole place oozes a sort of self-satisfied tranquility, like a wealthy uncle who spends his days patting his waistcoat and reminiscing about the good old days when the milkmaids curtsied just so. You can hire a boat, mind you, and putt around the lake, admiring the mountains. They are indeed impressive, those mountains, and probably have not the slightest interest in Lucerne’s tedious affairs. One suspects they’ve seen it all before; generation after generation of wealthy burghers and starry-eyed tourists all exclaiming over the same view. But then, I suppose, that is the entire game. The mountains stay put, providing a majestic backdrop, and Lucerne keeps on charming and charging, the whole business repeating itself year after year, like a particularly well-rehearsed play performed solely for the benefit of those who haven't seen it yet. And I, well, I stand back and observe, much like that lion, perpetually surprised, yet resigned to the peculiar spectacle of it all.
