Now, Carson City, that's a place that deserves a yarn or two, and not just because it's situated smack-dab in the middle of the Great Basin, like a stray marble someone dropped and forgot. It ain't exactly Paris, mind you, nor is it Virginia City, full of silver and swagger, though it tries. No, Carson is more like that fellow at the poker table who always folds, but you suspect he’s got a trick or two up his sleeve – mostly involving government forms and maybe a stray embezzled nickel. It's the capital, you see, which means it’s crammed to the gills with politicians, lawyers, and other such creatures who spend their days wrestling with words like "appropriation" and "constituent." These fellows, they strut about as if they own the place, which, come to think of it, they pretty much do.

You see the wide streets, wide enough for a stagecoach and a herd of sheep to amble side by side and not much else happening on them except maybe a tumbleweed or two. Buildings, mostly of the sort that aspire to be dignified but end up looking a little bit like they're trying too hard, like a feller dressed in his Sunday best to go dig for gold. There are a few grand houses, relics of when Carson thought it might be something more than a pit stop on the way to the Comstock. But mostly, it's just respectable, boring, and quieter than a church mouse during sermon time. Though, to be fair, there’s a certain charm to it. You get a feel that the residents of Carson are very proud of their state, and happy to share it with all those who visit. It's not the sort of place that’ll set your blood pumping, nor fill your pockets with silver. But if you want to see a town that’s got a solid, if somewhat uninspired, grip on the business of running a state, well, Carson City, that’s your huckleberry. Just don’t go expecting too much excitement, unless you count heated debates over water rights as such, and try not to gamble away all your money - those politicians have enough of it already.
