Now, about this “bucksheesh,” a word that rolls off the tongue like a rusty wagon wheel bumping over cobblestones, yet possesses a smoother, more insinuating quality when practiced. You’ll hear it bandied about in the Orient, thick as flies on a molasses barrel. It’s not quite bribery, mind you, though it flirts with the notion like a tipsy sailor with a clergyman’s wife. It’s more a lubricating oil for the gears of commerce, a balm for ruffled feathers, a little something to encourage swiftness where speed is naturally averse. Say you’re trying to navigate a particularly stubborn camel through a bazaar teeming with trinkets and veiled women, each more enticing than the last, and the camel driver has suddenly developed a keen interest in gazing at the clouds. A bit of bucksheesh, a small silver coin discreetly slipped into his palm, will miraculously realign his priorities. He’ll discover an urgent need to reach your destination, and the camel will, too, seemingly understanding the universal language of reward.

Of course, there are those who’ll hold their hands out for it at every turn, like beggars expecting a king's ransom for merely breathing the same air as you. These fellows will inconvenience you deliberately, manufacture complications where none exist, all with the hope of extracting a few extra piastres from your pocket. One learns to recognize the glint in their eye, the way their voice takes on a peculiar, mournful cadence, as if they’re recounting the tale of their impoverished grandmother. A firm, “La, shukran!” (No, thank you!) and a steely gaze often suffice, but sometimes a strategic application of bucksheesh, carefully measured like a physician dispensing medicine, is the only remedy. It's a delicate dance, this bucksheesh business, a tightrope walk between exploitation and efficiency. One must learn to play the game without becoming a victim of it, or worse, an enthusiast. For once you develop a taste for freely scattering your silver, you might as well hire a flock of vultures to follow you, because they’ll surely clean you out faster than any official tax collector.
