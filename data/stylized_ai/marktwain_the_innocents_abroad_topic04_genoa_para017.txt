Genoa, bless its heart, is a city built with more layers than a pastry chef's mille-feuille, and about as predictable in its temperament. You can wander its caruggi, those narrow, twisting alleys that make you feel like a rat in a particularly ornate maze, and swear you’ve circumnavigated the same fountain three times already. A fellow could get lost trying to find his own nose in this place, and I wouldn’t wager against it happening. The buildings, crammed together like nervous passengers on a crowded steamer, lean in conspiratorially, as if sharing secrets too scandalous for the open air. And the laundry! Mercy, the laundry. It’s strung across those alleys like triumphant banners celebrating…well, I’m not quite sure what, but celebrate they do, in every color imaginable, flapping in the salty breeze like a thousand tongues wagging gossip. One might think the Genoese are the cleanest people on Earth, or perhaps they are simply determined to deprive the sun of its natural right to shine upon the cobblestones below.

The harbor, ah, the harbor is a different kettle of fish altogether. There, the city opens up, and one can breathe without the fear of bumping elbows with a passing nonna. It's a bustling hubbub of activity, with ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing like corks on a restless sea. Sailors swagger about with that peculiar air of having seen too much and understood even less, their tales no doubt embellished with enough yarn to knit a sweater for a giant. And the smells! A heady concoction of salt air, fish (some fresher than others, I suspect), and something vaguely reminiscent of spices that have travelled halfway across the globe. It's a potent brew, enough to knock a teetotaler off his feet. One feels instantly transported to a world of adventure and intrigue, even if the most exciting thing one ends up doing is bargaining for a questionable souvenir from a vendor who looks like he’s been haggling since the days of Christopher Columbus. Genoa, you see, is a city of contradictions, a place where the grand and the gritty, the beautiful and the bewildering, coexist in a state of amiable chaos. A place, in short, that is thoroughly and utterly... Genoese.
