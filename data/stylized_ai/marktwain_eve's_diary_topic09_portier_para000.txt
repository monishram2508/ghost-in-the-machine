Now, a portier. There’s a thing with aspirations, wouldn’t you say? It aims for such grandeur, the poor dear, trying to be a door but never quite making the cut. More like a flimsy suggestion of a door, a velvet promise whispered rather than shouted. I recall one time, Adam, bless his simple heart, decided we needed one in the bower. Said it would keep out drafts. Drafts! As if a wisp of silk was any match for the breath of the Almighty himself! He hung it with such seriousness, Adam did, convinced it was a shield against the elements, a fortress of plushness. He even tried to nail it down tight, hammering away like he was building the Ark instead of just hanging a glorified bath towel.

Of course, the first good breeze turned it into a sort of flapping, velvet banshee, wailing at the hinges and generally making a nuisance of itself. The monkeys took to swinging on it, much to Adam’s chagrin, and the parrot learned to mimic the squeak it made on the rusty rings. It became less a partition and more a jungle gym, I daresay. Adam, ever the optimist, tried again. He added weights, thinking to give it some heft, some dignity. This only resulted in the thing pulling the whole frame down, nearly concussing him in the process. He sat there, amidst a pile of fabric and bent metal, looking more bewildered than when he first encountered the serpent.

In the end, he admitted defeat, with a sigh that could wither a pomegranate. We used the velvet to make some rather fetching trousers for the iguana, and the rings ended up as jewelry for the baboon. The experience, if I may say so, taught me a valuable lesson: Some things are best left as they are, untroubled by human aspiration. A good breeze is a good breeze, and no amount of fancy drapery is going to change that. Though I must admit, the iguana did look rather dapper in those velvet breeches. A bit overdressed for paradise, perhaps, but who am I to judge fashion in Eden?
