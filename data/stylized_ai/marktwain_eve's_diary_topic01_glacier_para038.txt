Well, I do declare, this glacier is quite the spectacle, though I reckon I’ve seen more lively sights in a graveyard at midnight. It’s a hulking, frosty behemoth, you see, like a mountain caught in the act of taking a nap – a slow, dreadfully slow nap, lasting longer than the minister’s sermons on a Sunday afternoon. One could spend an eternity watching it crawl, inch by glacial inch, towards the sea, and still have plenty of time left over to learn to play the fiddle, translate hieroglyphics, and perfect the art of napping oneself.

The colour, if you can call it that, is a sort of sickly bluish-white, like skimmed milk that’s been left out in the arctic air for a few days. They say it’s due to the compressed ice and whatnot, but I suspect it's just plain old modesty, trying not to be too showy with all its frozen finery. And the sounds it makes, oh, the sounds! A cacophony of groans and grumbles and the occasional crack that echoes like a disgruntled giant clearing his throat. One moment it seems like the end of the world is nigh, with the earth splitting asunder, and the next it is merely the sigh of the old glacier easing itself into a new position to keep the sun from blinding it. 

I've been told by these learned, be-spectacled gents who frequent the area that these glaciers are shrinking, melting away like a forgotten sugar cube in a cup of tea. Which, if you think about it, seems a rather unladylike thing to do; just disappearing bit by bit without so much as a goodbye. I suppose nature has its own ways of being contrary and nonsensical, just like the rest of us. Still, one can’t help but feel a touch of melancholy seeing such a formidable entity slowly fading into oblivion. It does make you wonder if everything, even the most imposing things, are destined to go away, like youth, money, or a good memory. Perhaps that is why we stare, captivated and bemused, at this frozen spectacle, this slow, relentless journey of ice toward the sea. It’s a memento mori, a reminder that even the longest, coldest of naps must eventually come to an end.
