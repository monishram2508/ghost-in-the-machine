Now, the miner, bless his optimistic heart, is a singular specimen, ain’t he? He arrives in these here parts with a pickaxe and a dream, heavier than any rock he expects to find. He's usually got more grit than good sense, and a stubborn streak wider than the Comstock Lode itself. He’ll swear he's just a hair's breadth away from strikin’ it rich, even when his claim's yieldin’ nothin’ but rattlesnakes and hardpan. You'll see him down there, day in and day out, coughin' up dust that'd choke a coyote, chiselin' away like a badger with a vengeance. He's got a song on his lips, usually off-key and about a gal he left behind, and a glint in his eye that says, "Today's the day, by thunder!"

Of course, most miners ain't got the sense to know when to quit. They'll be shovelin' dirt long after the town itself has packed up and moved on to the next "boom" town. And Lord help you if you tell him his claim's a bust. He'll launch into a yarn about a fella who gave up a day too soon and missed out on a mountain of silver the size of a church steeple. Always got a story, that miner, and more often than not, it's taller than the assay office. He's a suspicious cuss, too, always eyeing his neighbor’s pile of tailings like it's holdin’ the secret to eternal youth and untold riches. He'll share a swig of whiskey with you, mind you, but he'll keep one hand on his poke and the other on his pick. But despite all his faults, and Lord knows there's a mountain of 'em, you can’t help but admire the fool. He's the engine that drives this here country, fueled by equal parts hope, desperation, and a powerful hankerin' for a life a cut above the ordinary. And who knows, maybe, just maybe, one day he'll actually find what he's lookin' for. Probably not, though.
