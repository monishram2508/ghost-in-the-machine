Chamonix, they call it. A village nestled betwixt these gargantuan mountains, mountains so high they practically tickle the underbelly of heaven itself. And oh, the tourists! A flock of them, thicker than flies on a honeyed ham, descending upon the place with their peculiar enthusiasm for altitude and exorbitant prices. They come to conquer Mont Blanc, or at least to *say* they've conquered Mont Blanc, usually after being dragged up most of the way by some poor, unsuspecting mule, er, guide. One sees them waddling about in their brightly colored, puffed-up coats, looking for all the world like ambulatory marshmallows, convinced that a bit of fresh air and a breathtaking view will somehow cure them of their inherent ennui. They pose for photographs, these marshmallow people, squinting against the sun, grinning like simpletons who've just discovered fire, and then promptly retreat to their overpriced chalets to complain about the lack of decent Wi-Fi.

The locals, bless their hardy, wrinkled souls, seem remarkably unfazed by this annual influx of cosmopolitan buffoonery. They've seen it all before, you see. They likely learned to ski before they learned to walk, and they regard these city-slickers with a mixture of amusement and thinly veiled contempt. They know the mountain's secrets, the fickle nature of its weather, the hidden dangers lurking beneath the pristine snow. They watch the tourists charging headlong into potential disaster with the detached curiosity of a cat observing a mouse caught in a glue trap. And I confess, I myself find a certain dark humor in it all. It’s a grand spectacle, really. A comedy played out against a backdrop of breathtaking tragedy-in-the-making, where the players are rich, and the stage is the very roof of Europe. One almost expects a curtain call, complete with powdered wigs and a chorus line of yodeling goats. But no, it's just the eternal dance of man versus mountain, with man invariably making a fool of himself in the process. A diverting pastime, to be sure, and one well worth the price of a cup of lukewarm coffee in a café overflowing with faux-alpine charm.
