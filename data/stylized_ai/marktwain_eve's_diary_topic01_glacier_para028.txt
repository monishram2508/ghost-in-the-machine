We’ve been meandering about this chunk of ice, a glacier they call it, for what feels like an epoch – though Adam assures me it’s only been a handful of days. He’s ever so precise with his counting, bless his heart. It's a queer thing, this glacier, a river frozen solid in a fit of pique, I reckon. All jagged and uneven, like the landscape had a terrible toothache and just grimaced for eternity. They say it moves, these learned men with their instruments and pronouncements, but you’d hardly notice it unless you were a mountain with no pressing engagements. I swear, our garden patch shows more vim and vigor on a typical Tuesday.

Adam, of course, is fascinated. He's already invented a half dozen names for various crevasses and seracs (fancy words, I tell you, for holes and pointy bits). He even claims to have witnessed the birth of a baby iceberg – a dramatic event apparently involving a loud crack and a significant shift in his facial hair. I merely saw a bit of ice fall off, but who am I to argue with a man in the throes of scientific discovery? He’s climbed to the top of it too, declared it ‘sublime’ and ‘a veritable kingdom of frosted majesty’. Me? I preferred to stay closer to the bottom where I could keep an eye on my ferns. One wrong step up there and you’re liable to end up playing tag with a woolly mammoth that got stuck in a time warp. Besides, the view from down here is just grand enough to see all the silly things Adam is doing. It's a wonder the whole thing doesn't crumble with the weight of his intellectual curiosity. I suspect the Almighty, in His infinite wisdom, made glaciers extra sturdy just to accommodate Adam's antics. It’s either that, or He’s got a grand sense of humor, which, knowing the sorts of creatures He's been creating lately, is highly probable. Now, where did I put that apple?
