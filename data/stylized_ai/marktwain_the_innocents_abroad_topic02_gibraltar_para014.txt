Gibraltar, bless its stony heart, stands there like a perpetually surprised bulldog, jaw jutting defiantly at the straits, daring Morocco to so much as flutter a prayer rug in its general direction. A veritable pimple of Britishness stubbornly clinging to the Spanish nether regions, it is, in its own peculiar way, a delightful absurdity. Imagine, if you will, a rock; not just any rock, mind you, but a rock so strategically located that empires have drooled over it for centuries. Then imagine that this rock, this rather imposing geological feature, is somehow, magically, populated by a smattering of souls, a hearty blend of Genoese sailors, Maltese merchants, and, of course, the inevitable scattering of proper, stiff-upper-lip Britons, all squeezed together on a landmass scarcely larger than my Aunt Mildred’s prize-winning petunia patch. And they call it a country! One might sooner call a particularly stubborn ingrown toenail an independent republic.

The streets, mind you, are a curious blend of the quintessentially British and the utterly Mediterranean. You might, with equal ease, find yourself sipping a cup of tepid tea whilst dodging a scooter laden with enough oranges to supply a small orphanage for a week. And the monkeys! Ah, the Barbary macaques, those impudent little rapscallions, the true rulers of the Rock. They strut about with an air of entitlement that would make even a crowned monarch blush, relieving tourists of their spectacles and pocket watches with the practiced ease of a seasoned pickpocket. One expects, any day now, to see them sporting miniature bowler hats and demanding representation in Parliament. It is said that as long as the monkeys remain, so too will the British. A more precarious cornerstone upon which to build an empire, I cannot imagine. One shudders to think of the consequences should some particularly persuasive Spaniard offer them a lifetime supply of bananas and a siesta in perpetuity. Truly, the fate of Gibraltar hinges on the fickle whims of a troop of glorified, tail-less acrobats. A comedic opera playing out on a stage of stone, I tell you, a comedic opera.
