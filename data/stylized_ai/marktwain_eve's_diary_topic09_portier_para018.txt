Now, about this portier, this grand curtain that folks seem so all-fired up about. Lord, you'd think they were discussin' the mysteries of the universe, instead of a mere hangin' of cloth. Some people take to them with a passion I can't rightly fathom. They say it's for privacy, or to keep the drafts at bay, but I suspect it's mostly just for showin' off. A bit of fancy fabric, all tassels and velvet, to impress the neighbors or the preacher. Like peacocks displayin' their plumage, only instead of feathers, it's damask and brocade. 

I seen one once, a monstrous thing, the color of a sunset gone wrong, with gold thread woven through it thick as a spider's web. The owner, a woman with a nose so high in the air it could practically smell the clouds, claimed it was a "family heirloom." Now, I wouldn't doubt that her family was fond of ostentation, but I reckon that portier had seen more homes than a traveling salesman. Probably started its life in a Parisian bordello, then made its way across the Atlantic, sellin' itself as "authentic French." People, bless their hearts, will believe most anything if you wrap it in enough silk.

And the contortions they go through to hang these portiers! Ropes and pulleys, rods and rings, enough hardware to build a small suspension bridge. You'd think they were tryin' to raise the Titanic, not just cover a doorway. And Heaven forbid it should sag or wrinkle. Then, out come the irons and the sprays, and the frantic smoothing and adjusting, until the poor thing looks like it's been starched within an inch of its life. I suppose it's all part of the grand game, this endless pursuit of perfection in the mundane. Me, I'd just as soon nail a blanket over the door and be done with it. But then again, I never was one for fussing over fripperies. Give me a good book and a comfortable chair, and let the rest of the world worry about their portiers.
