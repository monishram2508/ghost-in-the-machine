Now, the Coliseum, bless its venerable heart, is a sight to behold, ain't it? A monstrous, hulking testament to the Romans' singular talent for putting on a good show – even if that show involved a chap wrestling a lion, or a whole gaggle of gladiators trying to rearrange each other's faces. One can't help but marvel at the sheer scale of the thing. Imagine, if you will, the audacity of those chaps, piling up stone upon stone, tier upon tier, until they'd crafted a bowl big enough to hold the better part of Rome's population – and probably a few stray dogs besides. And all for what, you ask? Entertainment, pure and simple. Though, "simple" might be a stretch, considering the amount of blood that was spilled within those hallowed (or perhaps I should say, hollowed) grounds.

They say you can still hear the echoes of the crowds, roaring their approval as some poor fellow met his untimely end. Though, to be honest, all I hear is the incessant chatter of tourists and the hawkers trying to sell you miniature Coliseums carved from cheap Italian marble, probably chipped by disgruntled fellows from China. But I digress. The genius of the place, you see, isn't just in its size, but in its design. Clever chaps, those Romans. They figured out how to funnel the masses in and out with remarkable efficiency, a skill lost on modern concert venues, I must say. And the seating! A tiered system, meticulously planned to ensure that everyone, from the Emperor in his box to the common pleb in the nosebleeds, had a reasonably good view of the carnage. Democracy in action, you might say, if democracy involved watching men try to disembowel each other. Still, a grand old place. Though I do wish they'd offer a more comfortable cushion for those stone seats. A chap's backside does get a bit sore after a couple of hours of contemplating the ephemeral nature of existence whilst surrounded by pigeons.
