Now, Damascus. A city they call old, older than Methuselah, likely, and thrice as dusty. I reckon if you shook Damascus hard enough, it'd crumble to the ground like a stale gingerbread man. But, Lord, the stories it could tell! Of conquerors come and gone, empires risen and fallen like so many bad stage curtains, and more bloodshed than a Chicago stockyard on a Saturday. They say Saint Paul had his vision near there, which explains a few things, perhaps; maybe the dust got in his eyes, gave him a touch of the vapors. I saw souks crowded thicker than flies on a molasses jug, merchants hawking their wares with voices that could charm the birds right out of the sky, or, more likely, scare them into the next county. 

You can buy anything in Damascus, from a carpet that’d make a sultan jealous to a rusty nail that’d make a junkman blush. And, mind you, everything's got a story, usually one that's half-truth and twice as entertaining. I recall a fellow trying to sell me a sword, claiming it was forged by Saladin himself. Offered it to me for a mere fortune, naturally. I asked him if Saladin happened to forge any horseshoes as well, seeing as my nag was looking a bit down at the heels. He didn't appreciate the jest, but his scowl was worth the price of admission, I assure you. They speak of the Damascene steel, mind you, sharp enough to shave a mosquito mid-flight. Though, I suspect that’s a salesman's tale, much like the one about the camel who could dance the polka. Still, the city's a spectacle. A glorious, chaotic, dusty, magnificent spectacle, a reminder that empires rise and fall, but the art of the bargain endures. One walks through its ancient streets feeling both a sense of awe and a desperate need for a decent bath.
