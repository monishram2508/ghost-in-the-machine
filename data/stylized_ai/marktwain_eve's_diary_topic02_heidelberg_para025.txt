Heidelberg, you see, is a town draped upon the Neckar like a velvet gown on a tipsy duchess. One suspects the hills had a bit too much Mosel wine and slumped rather gracefully into their current arrangement. The castle, that grand old ruin, is perched precariously atop, looking for all the world like a particularly dilapidated birthday cake left out in the rain. One can almost hear it whispering scandalous tales of princes, poets, and the occasional escaped monkey (one presumes such things happen; it's certainly more interesting to imagine them so). The university, of course, is the heart of the place, a breeding ground for serious thought and undoubtedly, a fair amount of youthful foolishness. I dare say more profound pronouncements have been made whilst nursing a stein of lager than within the hallowed halls themselves. The students, bless their enthusiastic souls, are forever scurrying about with books thicker than Bavarian dumplings, presumably trying to learn how to unravel the mysteries of the universe, or at least pass their examinations. The Neckar itself, that placid serpent, winds through it all, carrying barges laden with what I can only assume are mountains of sauerkraut and sausages destined for some grand, Teutonic feast. One can’t help but feel a certain kinship with the river, drifting along, observing the human comedy unfold on its banks. The townsfolk, bless their sturdy souls, are a study in contrasts: some are charmingly quaint, selling cuckoo clocks and gingerbread hearts, whilst others are possessed of a terrifying efficiency that could launch a thousand zeppelins on time. Ah, Heidelberg, a place where ruins whisper, rivers meander, and the only thing more intoxicating than the view is perhaps the local brew. It's a grand spectacle, I assure you, even if one does occasionally fear that the castle might decide to tumble down and land squarely in one's apfelstrudel.
