Brigham, that's the name everyone flung around like a gambler's last dollar in Salt Lake City. Now, I’d heard tell of Brigham Young, sure, out East. Figured him for some fire-breathing, brimstone-sniffing preacher, maybe with horns peeking through his beaver hat. But seeing him was another kettle of fish entirely. He wasn't no hell-raiser. More like a shrewd farmer, a calculating merchant, and a patriarch all rolled into one. Short, stout, with a face that could curdle milk if he set his mind to it, yet a twinkle in his eye that suggested he knew a good joke when he saw one, or, more likely, when he *made* one at your expense. He ran that whole blessed territory, you understand. Not with a velvet glove, mind you, more like a cast-iron fist covered in homespun cloth.

He had wives scattered across the valley like wildflowers in spring – a number that made even the most seasoned prospector’s jaw drop. They said he knew each and every one by name, which seemed a downright miracle considering their abundance. I reckon he must have kept a ledger somewhere, cross-referencing faces with offspring and household duties. The whole setup was a marvel of organization, a logistical nightmare for any other man, but Brigham, he seemed to thrive on it. He even had a sense of humor about the whole thing. I heard a tale of one fella asking him, all wide-eyed and innocent, "Brother Brigham, how do you manage it all?" And Brigham, without batting an eyelash, replied, "Well, son, a man's gotta have hobbies, doesn't he?" You couldn’t help but admire the sheer audacity of the man, the way he commanded respect, even if it was mixed with a healthy dose of awe and a sliver of suspicion. He was a force of nature, that Brigham, a living, breathing monument to the peculiar institution he fostered. And whether you agreed with his ways or not, you couldn't deny he knew how to build an empire from dust and devotion.
