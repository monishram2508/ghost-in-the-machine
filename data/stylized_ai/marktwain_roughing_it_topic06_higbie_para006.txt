Higbie, now there’s a specimen. A man carved out of granite and seasoned with sagebrush, he was. Claimed to be a “capitalist,” though the closest he ever got to capital was the leaky roof over his cabin and the occasional stray burro that mistook his beans for fodder. He’d arrived in Washoe, same as the rest of us greenhorns, with dreams of silver mountains and streets paved with nuggets the size of hen’s eggs. Found neither, of course. Instead, he found hard work, disappointment, and a landscape so stubborn it’d rather break your back than yield an ounce of precious metal.

He was a walking encyclopedia of tall tales, that Higbie. Claimed he once wrestled a grizzly bear for a gold pan, and won, though the bear kept the pan. Said he’d discovered a vein of pure silver that was so bright, it blinded him for a week, leaving him with a perpetual squint and a tendency to bump into things. Nobody believed him, naturally. We figured the squint came from staring too long at the Nevada sun and the bumping into things was just general clumsiness, a Higbie family trait, I reckon.

But there was a certain charm to the old fraud. He possessed the rare gift of making hard labor seem like a grand adventure, even when you were knee-deep in mud and your pickaxe was heavier than a sack of flour. He’d regale you with stories of legendary strikes and lost mines while you were chipping away at rock that looked suspiciously like it had already been chipped away at by a hundred other hopefuls. He’d swear on a stack of Bibles that the next swing would strike the motherlode, all the while knowing damn well the next swing would probably just break your back. Still, you’d keep swinging, wouldn’t you? Because Higbie, in his own peculiar way, instilled in you a belief that maybe, just maybe, the next swing really *would* bring fortune. And in a place like Washoe, that kind of belief was worth more than all the silver in the Comstock.
