Glaciers, those magnificent rivers of ice, are powerful agents of erosion and deposition, shaping landscapes over millennia. Formed from the gradual accumulation and compaction of snow, glaciers require specific climatic conditions: consistently cold temperatures, substantial snowfall, and minimal melting. Over time, the weight of overlying snow compresses the lower layers into dense glacial ice. This ice, under immense pressure, begins to deform and flow, albeit at a pace often measured in centimeters or meters per day. This movement is influenced by factors like ice thickness, slope angle, and the presence of meltwater at the glacier's base, which acts as a lubricant.

As glaciers advance, they sculpt the terrain through several processes. Plucking involves the freezing of water into cracks and fissures in the bedrock, which, upon expansion, breaks off fragments of rock that are then incorporated into the ice. Abrasion occurs as these embedded rocks, acting like sandpaper, grind against the underlying bedrock, smoothing and polishing the surface and leaving behind telltale striations. The debris carried within and on the glacier is eventually deposited as the ice melts and retreats. This material, known as glacial till, is a heterogeneous mixture of unsorted sediments ranging from massive boulders to fine clay.

Glacial landforms are diverse and dramatic. U-shaped valleys, carved by the erosive power of glaciers, contrast sharply with the V-shaped valleys formed by rivers. Cirques, bowl-shaped depressions formed at the head of glaciers, are often the sites of post-glacial lakes called tarns. Arêtes, sharp, jagged ridges, are formed where two or more cirques erode towards each other. Horns, pyramidal peaks, are sculpted by the erosion of multiple cirques surrounding a single summit. Moraines, ridges of till deposited at the edges or terminus of a glacier, mark the glacier's past extent. Eskers, sinuous ridges of gravel and sand, represent the former channels of meltwater streams flowing beneath the glacier. Drumlins, streamlined hills of till, are oriented in the direction of ice flow, providing further evidence of glacial movement. The study of these glacial features offers invaluable insights into past climates and the dynamic processes that continue to shape our planet's surface. They also hold critical information about climate change as their retreat provides data about temperature increase.
