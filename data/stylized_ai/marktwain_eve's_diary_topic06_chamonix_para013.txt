Chamonix, you say? A little village nestled 'neath the towering Mont Blanc, like a babe seeking shelter under its mother's voluminous skirts, if the mother happened to be a glacier-carved crag, that is. I confess, I journeyed there expecting a quaint Alpine scene, all cowbells and kindly yodelers, and found instead a congregation of daredevils, madmen, and tourists sporting more climbing hardware than a tinker's wagon. The air, you see, is perpetually charged with a sort of… well, a sporting mania, I suppose. One can scarcely walk a block without encountering a fellow rigged out like a Christmas tree with ropes and carabiners, muttering darkly about “crevasses” and “rappel points.” 

And the views! Oh, the views are splendid, naturally. The mountains stand about like grumpy old giants, forever shrouded in snow, forever daring you to try your luck on their perilous slopes. It's a magnificent spectacle, I admit, though I confess I preferred to admire it from the relative safety of a café, nursing a cup of something hot and vaguely alcoholic. The café crowd, mind you, are a sight to behold themselves. A motley assortment of sun-burnt adventurers, sporting a thousand-yard stare and regaling all within earshot with tales of near-death experiences, each tale more fantastical than the last. They puff their pipes with the gravity of senators debating matters of state, though their chief concern seems to be which brand of ice axe best manages a vertical ascent. You’ll find a few elegant ladies with poodle dogs, who are either incredibly brave or incredibly foolish. Most likely a bit of both. It's a right lively place, Chamonix, though I suspect if I were to stay too long, I might find myself tempted to scale one of those icy monstrosities myself, and that, my dear, would be a catastrophe worthy of dramatic recitation.
