Ballou, now there was a specimen of humanity fit to be stuffed and mounted beside the dodo bird, though I suspect the dodo possessed more practical sense. He hailed from some corner of the East where they apparently cultivate eccentricity like prize-winning pumpkins, arriving in Nevada with a carpetbag full of impractical ideas and a naiveté that would shame a newborn lamb. I reckon he thought he was coming to tame the wilderness with pamphlets and polite conversation. Bless his heart, the man tried. He did. He attempted to convince a grizzly bear to sign a temperance pledge, argued with a mule about the finer points of transcendentalism, and once, I swear on my mother's grave, he tried to teach a rattlesnake etiquette. Predictably, none of these endeavors proved particularly fruitful.

He was a walking, talking paradox, that Ballou. He could quote Shakespeare by the yard, but couldn't tell a shovel from a pickaxe. He could wax poetic about the beauty of the sunset, while simultaneously tripping over a sagebrush bush the size of a small ox. And his optimism! Good heavens, the man possessed optimism in quantities that could power a small city. Even after being fleeced at poker by a one-eyed prospector with a walrus mustache and a distinct lack of morals, Ballou would chirpily declare it a "learning experience" and promptly borrow more money to try again. He was a plumb fool, of course, but an endearing one. You couldn't help but feel a grudging respect for a fella so thoroughly and utterly out of his element, yet determined to make his mark on the world, even if that mark was just a series of comical misadventures. The West chewed up and spat out plenty of greenhorns, but Ballou, bless his cotton socks, managed to get chewed up, spat out, and then ask for seconds, all with a smile on his face and a sonnet on his lips.
