Higbie, now there's a name to conjure with, a monument to mediocrity if ever there was one. A feller might wander through the whole of Nevada, a territory chock-full of characters built from equal parts grit and guile, and still not stumble upon a specimen quite so… Higbie-ish. Picture, if you will, a scarecrow that's lost its stuffing, leaned over after a particularly potent gust of wind, and then been left to bake in the sun for a decade or two. That, my friends, is the outward manifestation of the inward Higbie. He was a man of few words, and those few were generally delivered with the enthusiasm of a mule being asked to haul gold uphill. He possessed a mind so uncluttered by thought that you could hear the echoes bouncing around inside.

His chief occupation, as far as I could ascertain, consisted of whittling twigs into smaller twigs and contemplating the profound mysteries of why the dust was always so dusty. He claimed to be a prospector, of course, as did every other vagrant roaming the Comstock, but his prospecting usually involved leaning against a rock, squinting at the horizon, and declaring the whole blamed country "played out." I suspect he'd sooner strike water in hell than strike silver in a mine. Yet, there was a certain unassuming charm to the feller, a kind of harmless incompetence that made you want to buy him a beer and tell him about your latest, equally unsuccessful, venture. He was the human embodiment of a dry wash; utterly devoid of value, but somehow, a comforting and familiar part of the landscape. And Lord knows, in a place like the Comstock, where fortunes were made and lost overnight, a touch of reliable, predictable nothingness was sometimes just what a man needed to keep his head screwed on right. So raise a glass, gentlemen, to Higbie, the man who proved that even in a land of silver kings, there was always room for a king of… well, let’s just say a king of the dirt.
