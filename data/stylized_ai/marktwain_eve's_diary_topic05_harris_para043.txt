Harris, now there's a specimen for the ages, a man cut from the peculiar cloth that only the Almighty, in a fit of absent-mindedness, could have woven. He fancies himself a man of business, a veritable captain of industry, though his ventures are generally limited to convincing unsuspecting acquaintances to invest in schemes that would make a seasoned riverboat gambler blush. Last I heard, he was trying to market a self-milking cow contraption, a marvel of gears and pulleys he designed himself, that, if the rumors are true, left Bessie the bovine rather worse for wear. She took to hiding in the hayloft at the mere sight of it, so I reckon the investment potential dried up faster than a puddle in the Nevada sun.

He has, of course, an explanation for every failed endeavor. Each collapse is blamed on faulty materials, unscrupulous contractors, or a sudden and unexpected shift in the global market for, say, dehydrated turnips (his previous unfortunate investment). Never, mind you, is it his own doing. Oh no, Harris is a genius stymied by the incompetence of the world around him. A martyr to progress, you might say, if the progress in question wasn't always heading straight into a ditch.

And his storytelling! Lord, it’s a tangled web of exaggerations and outright fabrications, spun with the same earnestness he displays when trying to sell you a bridge he doesn't own. He’ll regale you with tales of daring escapades involving runaway balloons, encounters with royalty (usually foreign royalty, the kind whose titles no one can verify), and near-death experiences involving runaway lawnmowers. One might suspect a deliberate intent to deceive, but I’m inclined to think he's started believing his own balderdash. It’s a defense mechanism, I suppose, against the harsh realities of a life spent mostly chasing rainbows and stumbling over common sense. He's a walking, talking cautionary tale, a reminder that a silver tongue and a boundless imagination are no substitute for good old-fashioned competence. Bless his heart, though, he’s a harmless sort, a reminder that life would be a deal less amusing without its share of well-meaning fools.
