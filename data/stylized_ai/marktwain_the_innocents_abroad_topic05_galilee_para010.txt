Now, Galilee, bless its cotton socks, is a place that's had more ink spilled over it than a clumsy scrivener at tax time. They call it "the Holy Land," which is fine and dandy, I suppose, if you’re the type to get all fluttery over a few piles of sun-baked rocks and the ghost of history. But, between you and me, I found it to be considerably less holy and considerably more dusty. The Sea of Galilee, well now, that's a body of water that's heard more sermons than a parson's parrot. They say it was once teeming with fish, enough to feed a biblical horde, but I suspect the local fishermen, with their nets and their mournful faces, would be more inclined to tell you about the barren spots and the scarcity of catch. The scenery, I grant you, has its moments. The hills roll like a tipsy sailor, and the wildflowers put on a brave show, though they're mostly the color of despairing sand. But let's not get carried away. It ain't the Garden of Eden, though I daresay some guidebook writers would have you believe it is.

The villages surrounding the sea are curious affairs. A muddle of sun-bleached buildings, each one seemingly on the verge of collapsing into a picturesque ruin. The locals, well, they’re a hardy bunch, weathered and wise in the ways of extracting a living from a stubborn land. They greet you with a smile and an outstretched hand, though I’d be lying if I said I didn’t suspect they were also sizing up your pocketbook at the same time. I partook of their local fare – unleavened bread tough enough to patch a saddle, and fish that tasted suspiciously like the mud from the bottom of the Sea. But one can’t complain too much, I suppose. A traveler must be ready to put up with a little discomfort in the pursuit of knowledge, or at least a decent story to tell. And Galilee, despite its dust and its disappointments, has a story to tell. Whether you believe it or not, well, that’s entirely up to you. Just don't expect me to swear it's all gospel truth. I've seen too much of the world, my friends, to believe everything I read in a guidebook.
