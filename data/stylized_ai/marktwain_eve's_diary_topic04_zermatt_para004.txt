Zermatt, you say? A village perched amidst the Alps like a cuckoo clock ornament gone astray. One is immediately struck by the unsettling lack of motorcars, as if the modern age took one look at the place and declared, "Nope, too much effort," leaving it stranded in a past where horse-drawn carriages are deemed cutting-edge technology. The air, I must concede, is suspiciously pure, a stark contrast to the smoky belches of civilization I'm accustomed to. It feels almost... medicinal, like inhaling the breath of a particularly virtuous nun. This, of course, is likely a clever ruse to distract one from the exorbitant prices charged for everything from a humble crust of bread to a thimbleful of wine. They claim it's the altitude, you see, that makes everything so dear. As if hauling potatoes up a mountain triples their value! I suspect it's more likely the altitude of their arrogance.

The Matterhorn, that infamous peak, looms over the entire affair like a disapproving headmaster. It's undeniably impressive, I'll grant them that. A jagged tooth of rock defying gravity and looking down its stony nose at the hapless tourists below. Every sunrise brings a fresh horde of eager shutterbugs, all determined to capture its majesty. The poor dears. They stand there, shivering in the glacial air, squinting through their contraptions, convinced they're the first to ever behold such a sight. Little do they know, the Matterhorn has seen it all before. It's probably yawning behind its icy façade, thinking, "Another day, another flock of picture-snapping imbeciles." And the skiers, bless their reckless hearts! They hurl themselves down those slopes with a fervor I usually reserve for dodging door-to-door salesmen. A rather exciting spectacle, truth be told, though I prefer to observe from the safety of a warm chalet, preferably with a strategically placed glass of something fortifying in hand. After all, there's nothing quite like the thrill of vicarious danger, especially when one can simultaneously avoid frostbite and potential dismemberment. A curious place, Zermatt. A charming, albeit slightly absurd, monument to the art of relieving wealthy travelers of their disposable income.
