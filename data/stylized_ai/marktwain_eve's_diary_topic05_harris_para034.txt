Harris, now there's a specimen for the naturalist's magnifying glass, a creature so utterly convinced of his own competence that he couldn't locate the Mississippi on a map if he were standing knee-deep in it. He's the sort who’ll tell you the correct way to boil an egg even though he's never personally encountered a hen, or, for that matter, an egg that wasn’t already hard-boiled. He approached that canoeing trip, you recall, with the breezy confidence of a circus lion tamer facing a declawed kitten, utterly oblivious to the actual dangers that lurked, not in ferocious beasts, but in leaky canvas and ill-advised campfire cooking. He packed enough canned goods to provision a small army, mostly containing ingredients that detested each other on a fundamental level, promising a stew that would have gagged a buzzard.

Then, the tools! Oh, Lord, the tools! He had more contraptions and gizmos than a watchmaker's shop, each designed to perform some obscure, hypothetical function we’d never require on a simple river journey. One, I believe, was advertised as a self-sharpening fish scaler powered by a hand crank – a device so elaborate and pointless that it might have been invented by a committee of squirrels. Of course, none of them actually worked when called upon. The fish scaler sharpened nothing, the self-bailing bucket merely redistributed the water, and the collapsible tent… well, let's just say it resembled a bewildered spider trying to hold up a bedsheet in a hurricane.

And yet, through it all, Harris remained undeterred, blissfully unaware of the chaos he was creating. He'd pronounce the latest disaster as "a slight setback," followed by another demonstration of some equally impractical invention. He possessed a faith in his own abilities that bordered on religious mania, a faith that even the near-drowning incident with the inflatable bathtub couldn't shake. He’s truly a marvel of self-deception. He would tell us a tale of heroism in a disastrous and comical situation, all the while having been the actual catalyst for the problem. Yes, Harris is a puzzle, an enigma wrapped in a life vest and secured with a rusty can opener. A monument to human error, but a thoroughly entertaining one, nonetheless.
