Now, about this peculiar custom they have out in those sun-baked lands, this business they call "bucksheesh." Why, it’s enough to make a church deacon question the very fabric of honesty, though perhaps the deacon already has a few such questions lurking in the dark corners of his own ledger, eh? It seems everything, and I do mean *everything*, requires a little greasing of the palm. You want your donkey to amble along with a bit more pep? Bucksheesh. You desire the fellah hauling your trunk to hoist it with something less than a grunt that suggests a mortal wound? Bucksheesh. You wish to inquire politely about the direction to the nearest oasis without receiving a convoluted tale involving three blind camels and a sandstorm that occurred in the reign of King Tut? Well, bless your heart, friend, you'd best be prepared to offer a little bucksheesh.

They’ll look at you with eyes so mournful and pleading, you’d swear they haven't eaten a morsel in a fortnight, even if their belly stretches taut beneath their threadbare robes like a well-fed melon. It's a performance, I tell you, worthy of the grandest stages of Europe. And the sums involved? Well, they’re hardly enough to bankrupt a church mouse, but the cumulative effect is enough to leave a man feeling like he’s been gently, yet persistently, fleeced by a flock of particularly charming crows. They call it a tip, a gift, a little something for the effort. I call it organized begging with a Middle Eastern flair.

And the thing of it is, you get used to it. You resign yourself to the fact that every transaction, no matter how small, will involve the unspoken, yet ever-present, specter of bucksheesh. You start carrying a pocketful of small coins, not for charitable purposes, mind you, but for survival. You even begin to anticipate the requests, budgeting your day accordingly. It’s a curious system, I grant you, a bit unsettling to the sensibilities of a proper American gentleman, but after a while, you find yourself grudgingly admiring its utter, unwavering prevalence. Why, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that even the Sphinx demanded a little bucksheesh from the tourists before deigning to answer their riddles.
