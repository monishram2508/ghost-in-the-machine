Well, pard, the desert rat I knew, he weren’t no ordinary fella. Name of Silas – though some called him "Sand Silas," which suited him right down to the gritty marrow of his bones. Silas, now, he had a claim out near Pioche, or what *he* called a claim. More like a patch of dirt sprinkled with fool's gold and the occasional petrified lizard. He’d been diggin’ at it for nigh on thirty years, convinced he was sittin’ on the mother lode. Said he could smell the silver, could hear it singin’ to him from beneath the baked earth. Now, I ain't one to argue with a man and his delusions, especially not when said man is holdin' a pickaxe the size of a small child.

He lived in a shack that leaned more than the Tower of Pisa, patched together with whatever the desert coughed up - bits of corrugated iron, wagon wheels, even a discarded bustle from some poor woman who’d likely lost her way and more than just her sense of fashion. Inside, it smelled like a potent mix of dried beans, dust, and ambition – mostly the latter, gone rotten from lack of success. He kept a burro named Beatrice, the most contrary creature I ever did meet. Beatrice, she’d refuse to budge for Silas, but would follow me around like a lovesick pup, tryin’ to nibble at my trousers. Silas swore she was jealous of my good looks, though I reckoned she was just tired of his singin'. He’d croon to her at night, songs about fortunes found and ladies wooed, none of which, I’m certain, Beatrice could comprehend, but they were enough to keep the coyotes at bay. He’d then often offer me some watered-down whiskey, proclaiming we were two kindred spirits seeking the ultimate riches, he in the earth, me in the telling. And I'd nod along, drink that rotgut, and contemplate whether riches, or just a decent pair of boots, were worth all the bother. The desert, you see, pard, it does funny things to a man, especially a man alone with a burro and a dream that's dustier than the landscape surrounding him.
