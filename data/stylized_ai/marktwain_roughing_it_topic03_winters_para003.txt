Winter, now there's a scoundrel of a season, ain’t it? Comes creeping in like a claim jumper with a sob story, promising crisp air and picturesque landscapes. Liar! It’s a blustery, bone-chilling bandit is what it is, robbing you blind of sunshine and replacing it with a landscape bleaker than a miner’s prospects after striking fool's gold. Why, I recall one winter up in Virginia City that was so fierce, the mercury plumb forgot what positive numbers were. Froze solid, it did, clinging to the bottom of the thermometer like a gambler to his last dollar.

The wind howled something awful, sounding like a pack of coyotes arguing over a particularly scrawny rabbit. We built fires, naturally, piled ‘em high with any wood we could lay our hands on – old furniture, packing crates, even a mangy stray doghouse (empty, mind you, wouldn’t be that cruel). The heat warmed you on one side and froze you on the other, like a poorly roasted pig. And the snow? Lord almighty, the snow. It piled up higher than a preacher’s guilt after a visit to the saloon. Folks swore it was drifting in from Canada, determined to bury us all under a mountain of white treachery. 

You’d try to walk about, bundled up like a mummy in layers of wool and burlap, but the wind would find a way to sneak in, nipping at your nose and ears like a mischievous imp. And the drifts! Stepping in one was like falling into a bottomless pit of frozen disappointment. More than one fella got lost just trying to cross the street. Truth is, winter’s a test, a trial by icy fire, and only the hardiest, or perhaps the foolish enough, survive it with their sanity intact. Makes you appreciate a good spring thaw, it does, almost as much as a winning hand at poker.
