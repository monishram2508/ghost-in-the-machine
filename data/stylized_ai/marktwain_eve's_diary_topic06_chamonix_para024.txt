Now, Chamonix. They call it the "Mecca of Alpinism," do they? Mecca, indeed. More like a marketplace for fools with a death wish and pockets lined with francs! I ventured there, naturally, to observe humanity, or rather, its more peculiar specimens. The air itself is thinner than the patience of a saint, and the prices? Criminal, I tell you, criminal! One would think they mine gold from Mont Blanc itself.

The village, nestled like a frightened chick beneath the towering, snow-capped giants, is a chaotic jumble of shops peddling overpriced trinkets and “genuine” climbing gear – genuine, I suspect, only in its capacity to lighten the climber's wallet. Every other soul seems to be draped in Gore-Tex, a material that, I am convinced, was invented solely to mock the fashion sense of the mountaineering class. They strut about with an air of self-importance, as if merely inhabiting Chamonix has bestowed upon them the wisdom of Reinhold Messner. You see them, these fellows, planning their ascents with maps the size of bedsheets, speaking in hushed tones of "crevasses" and "seracs" as if discussing the intricacies of a royal court. 

Meanwhile, I found myself more fascinated by the antics unfolding closer to the ground. A particularly stout gentleman, his face the color of a well-worn boot, attempted to navigate a cobblestone street while laden with enough equipment to conquer Everest. He tripped, naturally, sending a cascade of carabiners and pitons clattering onto the pavement. A small dog, observing the chaos with canine amusement, promptly snatched up a particularly shiny ice axe and trotted off with it, leaving the gentleman sputtering and red-faced. It was a spectacle worthy of the gods, or at least, a decent etching in a humorous periodical. Ah, Chamonix! A place where man strives to touch the heavens, only to be humbled by gravity and a mischievous poodle. It's enough to make a humorist weep with joy, and promptly order another glass of vin chaud.
