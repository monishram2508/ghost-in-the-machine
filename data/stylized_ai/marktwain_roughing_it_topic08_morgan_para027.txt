So, there I was, kicking up dust in Virginia City, a place so civilized you could get shot for breathing wrong and still nobody’d interrupt their poker game. And who should saunter in, but Morgan. Now, Morgan was a specimen, a walking advertisement for the peculiar charms of the American West. He had a beard that could house a family of field mice, a squint that suggested he'd spent his formative years arguing with the sun, and a manner that could curdle milk at fifty paces. He claimed to be a prospector, naturally, though the only gold he ever seemed to unearth was the occasional lost coin under a saloon table. He’d regale anyone who’d listen – and plenty who wouldn't – with tales of strikes so rich they made Croesus look like a pauper. Only problem was, every one of those strikes was just around the next bend, or over the next mountain, or in a dream he had after too much red-eye whiskey.

He possessed a singular talent for borrowing money, a talent honed to a razor's edge. He could spin a yarn about needing a grubstake to save his dying burro, or a new pickaxe to dislodge a mountain of pure silver, with such heartfelt conviction that even the most hardened banker would momentarily forget the virtues of compound interest. Of course, the burro always recovered suspiciously quickly, and the silver mine remained as elusive as a politician’s promise. Still, you couldn't help but admire the sheer audacity of the man. He was a walking monument to optimism, even if that optimism was based on nothing more than hot air and a talent for self-deception. He was, in short, the embodiment of the western spirit, a blend of grit, gullibility, and a desperate hope that tomorrow would be different, even though experience clearly suggested otherwise. I suspected that if you dissected Morgan, you'd find sawdust, dreams, and a lingering scent of cheap whiskey. And you know, I reckon the world would be a little duller without fellows like him wandering about.
