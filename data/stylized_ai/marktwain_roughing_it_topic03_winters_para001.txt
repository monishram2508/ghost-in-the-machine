Winter in these here parts, she's a character, I tell you. Not the sort you’d invite for Sunday supper unless you’re partial to icicles in your gravy. Comes swooping down like a hawk on a field mouse, she does, leaving everything stiff and blue-lipped. Lord, the way she howls! Sounds like a banshee arguing with a timber wolf over a particularly scrawny rabbit. And the snow? Why, it's the kind that buries cabins clean up to the eaves, leaving the poor occupants to dig themselves out come spring, provided they haven't taken to chewing on their boots out of sheer boredom.

Now, I ain’t saying winter ain’t got its charms. There's a certain something about seeing the whole blasted world covered in a pristine white blanket. Makes you feel like you’re the first fella to set foot on it, though, more likely, you're just the first fool willing to brave the biting wind. And the sunsets? Well, they can be mighty fine, painting the sky in colors that would make even the most hardened prospector pause and consider if there might be a bit of beauty left in this godforsaken land. Course, that beauty is usually accompanied by a temperature that'll freeze the whiskers right off your face, so you’re best advised to admire it from inside, next to a roaring fire, with a jug of something that burns all the way down.

The animals, they ain’t no happier about it than we are. Squirrels burying nuts with the frenzied energy of a gold rush miner, birds puffed up like cotton balls, looking for all the world like they’re about to explode from sheer frustration. And the coyotes? Their yipping carries across the frozen landscape like a mournful telegram, announcing yet another critter who’s succumbed to the Big Chill. Yep, winter’s a tough mistress. She tests your mettle, your patience, and your supply of firewood. And if you survive her, you’ll be all the more ready to face whatever foolishness comes next. Though, frankly, after a winter like some we've had, I'm half-inclined to pack my bags and head south, become a banana farmer, and never look back. Though I reckon I’d probably just complain about the heat and the humidity then. Can't win, I suppose.
