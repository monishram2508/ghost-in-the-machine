Chamois are captivating ungulates belonging to the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae, inhabiting the rugged, mountainous regions of Europe. Two distinct species are recognized: the Rupicapra rupicapra, native to the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, Balkans, and other mountainous areas of continental Europe, and the Rupicapra pyrenaica, found in the Pyrenees and Cantabrian Mountains. They are remarkably adapted to their harsh environment, possessing a slender, agile build that allows them to navigate steep slopes and rocky terrain with ease. Their hooves are specially adapted, with a soft, rubbery core providing exceptional grip on slippery surfaces. Chamois typically stand around 70-85 centimeters at the shoulder and weigh between 30 and 60 kilograms. Their coats are a reddish-brown color in the summer, transitioning to a darker, almost black, hue in the winter for better camouflage against the snow-covered landscapes. A distinctive dark stripe runs down their backs, contrasting with the lighter underbelly. Both males and females sport short, backward-hooked horns, although the males' horns tend to be thicker and more curved.

Chamois are primarily diurnal, spending their days foraging on grasses, herbs, leaves, and shoots. They are herbivores, meticulously selecting the most nutritious plants available in their often-sparse habitat. During the warmer months, they typically graze in open alpine meadows, while in the winter they descend to lower altitudes, seeking shelter in forested areas and feeding on whatever vegetation they can find beneath the snow. Chamois live in small herds, typically led by an older, experienced female. This social structure provides added protection against predators such as wolves, lynx, and eagles. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, including bleats, snorts, and alarm calls. The breeding season, known as the rut, occurs in late autumn. Males engage in fierce displays of dominance, battling each other for mating rights. A single kid is usually born in the spring, hidden amongst the rocks and vegetation, and remains with its mother for several months. Despite their resilience, chamois populations are vulnerable to habitat loss, climate change, and hunting pressure, making conservation efforts crucial to ensure their long-term survival in these majestic mountain ecosystems.
