Higbie, now there was a specimen. You wouldn't mistake him for a Sunday school superintendent, not unless the Sunday school was held in a saloon and the lessons were on the proper handling of a six-shooter. Higbie was a man carved out of granite, though I reckon some would claim he was whittled from driftwood, given his particular brand of untamed dishevelment. He’d arrived in Nevada with the dust and grit clinging to him like a second skin, a human tumbleweed blown in by the winds of fortune, or more likely, misfortune. He possessed a laugh like a coyote gargling with gravel, a sound that could curdle milk and send chickens scattering for the nearest cover.

His mining theories, Lord love him, were something to behold. One involved whispering sweet nothings to the ore, another consisted of burying a rusty horseshoe at midnight under a full moon. Naturally, neither proved exceptionally lucrative, but Higbie never lost faith. He’d just scratch his chin, spit a prodigious amount of tobacco juice into the dust, and proclaim that the gold was “jes’ a mite shy this time around.” He could spin a yarn that’d make Baron Munchausen blush, tales of lost Spanish mines guarded by spectral panthers, and veins of silver so pure they practically glowed in the dark. Now, whether a word of it was true, I couldn’t rightly say, but they were entertaining as a badger fight, and just about as believable.

He had a heart, somewhere beneath that crust of cynicism and general cussedness, I suppose. He’d share his last crust of bread, his last drop of whiskey, with a man in need, though he might complain about it the whole while. He was a walking, talking paradox, Higbie was, a man you could love and despise in equal measure. And Nevada, in its infinite wisdom, seemed to breed such creatures in abundance. So, raise a glass to Higbie, whether he's striking it rich on the other side, or still whispering to rocks, hoping to coax them into yielding their secrets. He was a character, alright, a vital, if somewhat flawed, part of the great, glorious, and utterly preposterous pageant that was the Wild West.
