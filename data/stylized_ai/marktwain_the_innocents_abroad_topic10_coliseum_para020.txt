Now, the Coliseum, bless its crumbling old heart, is quite the sight. A gigantic ruin it is, and one can’t help but feel a bit like a flea contemplating an elephant skeleton. They say gladiators fought to the death here, which I suppose is one way to spend an afternoon, though I personally prefer a good game of billiards. Imagine, would you, facing down a snarling lion with only a net and a grim determination. I wager the ticket sales were phenomenal, far surpassing even Barnum's wildest speculations.

The tourists swarm around the place like flies on a treacle barrel, gaping and clicking their infernal photographic machines. They’re all looking for that certain something, that feeling of ancient Rome, I reckon. Though I suspect most of them are just trying to get a picture without another tourist’s hat in the frame. One can hardly blame them.

They tell you it's a monument to Roman power, a testament to their engineering prowess, and all that highfalutin guff. And maybe it is. But mostly, it looks like a quarry that’s gone horribly wrong. A quarry with a severe identity crisis, if you will. Still, it’s undeniably impressive, the scale of the thing, even in its dilapidated state. You can almost hear the roar of the crowd, the clang of steel, the pained cries of the vanquished, though that may have been my own stomach grumbling after a suspect plate of Roman pasta. All in all, a grand and morbid spectacle, like a party where everyone forgot to bring a punchbowl and decided to hold a reenactment of the Peloponnesian War instead. A fine place to visit, but I certainly wouldn’t want to be employed there, not even as the chap in charge of sweeping up the leftover lions. I suspect that particular task came with a rather limited life expectancy.
