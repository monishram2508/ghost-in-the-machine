Now, a mosque, you see, is a curious sort of edifice. Not unlike a church, mind you, but with a flair, a certain Eastern panache that sets it apart like a dromedary at a dog show. You'll often find 'em topped with these onion-shaped domes, like a sultan's particularly bulbous hat, and minarets sticking up like fingers scolding the heavens, calling the faithful to prayer five times a day. And Lord, can they holler! A fellow could be enjoying a peaceful siesta and suddenly be jolted awake by some chap caterwauling from a tower, urging everyone to "come to salvation!" As if salvation was a potluck supper and you’d miss the best potato salad if you didn't hurry.

Inside, they keep things rather Spartan, compared to some of those overstuffed cathedrals back in Europe. No pews to speak of, just carpets spread out for kneeling, and walls often decorated with calligraphy, which to my untrained eye looks like an exceedingly complicated doodle. They face Mecca, of course, that sacred city shimmering in the Arabian sands. It’s said that Muslims, wherever they may be, always turn that way to pray. Imagine the confusion if Mecca suddenly decided to relocate! The devout would be doing acrobatic turns, trying to keep their bearings.

The whole affair strikes me as a rather earnest undertaking, this business of praying and piety. Though, between you and me, I suspect even the most devout of them occasionally sneak a peek at their neighbor during prostration, just to make sure they're getting the bowing angle right. Human nature, you see, is a stubborn thing, even in the house of God – or, in this case, the house of Allah. And while I might not entirely grasp all the finer points of their theology, I can certainly appreciate the dedication. It's hard to argue with folks who take their beliefs seriously, even if their minarets do occasionally interrupt a perfectly good afternoon nap.
