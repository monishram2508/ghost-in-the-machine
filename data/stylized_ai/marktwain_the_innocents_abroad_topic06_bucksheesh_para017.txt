Now, this bucksheesh, this 'gift' as they delicately call it in those sun-baked lands, is a curious institution, a lubricant that keeps the cogs of society turning, albeit in a manner that would make a self-respecting watchmaker shudder. You see, it ain't exactly bribery, not in the outright, villainous sense of handing over a sack of gold doubloons to pervert justice. No, it's far more subtle, more like a persistent drizzle than a raging thunderstorm. A fellow might find himself stalled at a dusty border crossing, his travel papers scrutinized with the intensity of a philologist examining the Rosetta Stone, until a discreetly folded bank note finds its way into the officer's palm. Suddenly, the hieroglyphics on the passport become remarkably legible, and the fellow is waved through with a smile as wide as the Nile.

Or perhaps one desires a prime seat at the bazaar, a vantage point from which to observe the swirling chaos of merchants and camels. One could, of course, engage in a tiresome negotiation, haggling for hours over a few inches of real estate. Or, one might simply offer a small bucksheesh to the proprietor, a token of appreciation for his discerning taste in clientele, and find oneself miraculously elevated to the front row, with a complimentary cup of sweet, muddy coffee to boot. It’s a system, you see, that greases the wheels, smoothes the path, and generally makes life a tad less arduous in a land where arduousness is already in plentiful supply. Of course, it's all rather irregular, and a stickler for rules might find it morally objectionable. But as I observed, standing knee-deep in dust and surrounded by the cacophony of a thousand voices, sometimes a little bucksheesh is the only thing standing between a man and utter exasperation. Besides, who am I to judge? I have a sneaking suspicion that even the most righteous among us might find a small temptation to smooth their own way when the desert sun is beating down and the nearest oasis is still a day's ride away.
