Well, pard, lemme tell you about this pardner I had back in the Comstock days, a feller we called "Dusty" Rhodes. Now, Dusty wasn't the sharpest tack in the box, you see, but he was a loyal sort, loyal as a hound dog to a greasy bone. Claimed he could smell gold a mile off, though all he ever seemed to smell was stale whiskey and unwashed socks. Always had some outlandish scheme brewing in that empty head of his. One time, he got it in his mind to train a team of jackrabbits to pull a ore cart. Said it'd be faster and cheaper than mules. Can you imagine? Spent a whole month chasing those varmints around the desert, only to end up with more scratches than a hound has fleas. The only ore those rabbits hauled was the kind that ended up stuck in Dusty's beard. 

He was a sight to behold, that Dusty, all elbows and knees, clad in a coat that looked like it lost a fight with a family of skunks. He had this habit of talkin' to himself, too, usually about the millions he was gonna make. Never did make those millions, mind you, but that didn't stop him from plannin'. He was always buyin' lottery tickets, convinced he was about to hit the big one, but the closest he ever came was winning a free chicken dinner at the saloon, which he promptly traded for a shot of rotgut whiskey. 

He was a good soul, though, despite his quirks. Always willing to share his last pinch of tobacco, even if it tasted like dried riverbed mud. And he had a heart bigger than a buffalo, always ready to lend a hand to a feller in need. He may not have struck it rich, but he sure did leave a mark on those who knew him. Just goes to show, pard, it ain't always about the gold, sometimes it's about the memories you make along the way. And Dusty Rhodes, bless his addled heart, made plenty of memories, most of 'em ridiculous, but memories nonetheless.
