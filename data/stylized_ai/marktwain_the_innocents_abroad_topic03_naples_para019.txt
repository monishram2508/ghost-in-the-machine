Naples, ah, a city that clings to the slopes of Vesuvius like a barnacle to a particularly stubborn rock, and about as charming in its first impression, if I may be so bold. A chaos of laundry flapping from balconies – enough linen to outfit a small, rebellious navy – interwoven with the cries of vendors hawking their wares, a cacophony fit to wake the very dead buried beneath Pompeiian ash, and indeed, they may very well be awake down there, given the general racket. One navigates the streets, not so much walking as participating in a daring steeplechase, dodging Vespas driven by lads seemingly trained in the art of near-death experiences, and children who appear to have made a pact with the cobblestones, granting them immunity to bodily harm. The buildings, bless their crumbling façades, look as though they have aged several lifetimes, each a testament to forgotten empires and dubious construction practices. One half expects them to simply sigh wearily and collapse into a picturesque heap of rubble, adding to the city's already considerable supply of antique detritus.

Yet, and here’s the rub, like a particularly pungent cheese that slowly wins you over, there's a certain… allure to this Neapolitan pandemonium. One discovers little piazzas, hidden like guilty secrets, where old men sip espresso and argue politics with the fervor of gladiators defending their honor. The aroma of pizza, baked in ovens that likely predate the unification of Italy, hangs heavy in the air, a siren song to the hungry traveler. And the people! Lord, the Neapolitans! A boisterous, gesticulating, operatic lot, each one a character ripe for the pen of a playwright. They argue, they laugh, they weep, they eat, all with a passion that puts a Broadway production to shame. They'll cheat you blind one minute, then offer you a slice of their grandmother's secret recipe the next. It's a maddening, exhilarating, thoroughly exhausting experience, and one that leaves you wondering if you've just witnessed the birth of civilization or its impending doom. Either way, you won't soon forget it, even if you desperately try.
