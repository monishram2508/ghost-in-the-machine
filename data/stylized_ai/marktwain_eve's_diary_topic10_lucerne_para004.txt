Lucerne, bless its little Swiss heart, sits there on its lake like a particularly smug swan, all prim and proper with its medieval bits carefully polished. You’d think, judging by the postcards, that the place was invented solely for tourists who have a deep and abiding love for cuckoo clocks and panoramic views, and perhaps they ain't wrong. I confess, I succumbed myself. I went and gazed upon the Water Tower, which, from a distance, does indeed resemble a rather stout chess piece dropped into the Reuss River after a particularly heated match. They tell you it's centuries old, full of history and significance. Likely true, but I suspect half the history involves some poor fellow falling in the river trying to retrieve his hat. And then there's Chapel Bridge, poor thing. Burned like kindling, it did, some years back. Now, they've rebuilt it, of course, but it's like trying to revive a rose with glue and paint. Still charming, mind you, but there's a certain… well, a certain *newness* about it, like a newly married couple pretending they haven't a clue what they’re doing.

The town itself, though, hums with that quiet Swiss efficiency that both impresses and intimidates. The shops are full of watches that tell you not only the time in fifteen different time zones but also the probability of rain next Tuesday and the exact number of chocolate chips in the nearest Swiss Roll. One imagines a secret society of Swiss watchmakers plotting global domination through precise timekeeping and delicious confectionery. I even spotted a cat, a ginger fellow with a superior air, lounging on a windowsill. He looked for all the world like he owned the place, and probably did. I swear, he winked at me, as if to say, “Yes, another tourist. Please, do take your photograph and contribute to our national treasury." One can't help but admire the ingenuity. Lucerne is a stage, alright, and we tourists are the willing actors, happily playing our roles of wide-eyed wanderers, ready to be charmed, photographed, and subtly, ever so subtly, relieved of our hard-earned francs. It's a good show, though. A darned good show.
