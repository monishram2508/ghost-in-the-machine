Naples, ah, Naples! A city so teeming with life, and perhaps a little too much death for comfort, that one half expects Vesuvius to simply shrug and declare, "Enough, already!" The place is a veritable opera played out in the streets, with every man, woman, and child a star in their own noisy, gesticulating drama. I've seen funerals wailing louder than a cat tied to a tin can, and weddings more raucous than a dogfight in a brewery. The coachmen, blessed souls, drive like they're late for the apocalypse, dodging carts and children with the nimble grace of a caffeinated spider monkey. And the smells! A symphony of sewage and sun-ripened tomatoes, of fish just pulled from the bay and garbage just pulled from... well, who knows where. One suspects the air itself is flavored with garlic and a hint of imminent chaos.

The Neapolitan is a marvel, a creature of pure, unadulterated cunning and cheer. He will swear on his mother's grave that the knock-off watch he’s peddling is genuine Swiss craftsmanship, and then cheerfully admit he’s never even *seen* Switzerland. He'll argue with the ferocity of a cornered badger over a single lira, then turn around and give half his bread to a mangy street dog. Their laundry, bless their optimistic hearts, hangs from every balcony like a declaration of war against the monotony of daily life. It's a veritable tapestry of undergarments, waving and flapping in the breeze, daring you to find a matching pair. And the noise! Lord, the noise. It's a constant barrage of car horns, shouting vendors, and the operatic lamentations of street singers. One longs for the quiet solitude of a roaring train just to catch a moment of peace. Yet, despite all the racket and the squalor, Naples has a certain charm, a roguish appeal that tugs at the heartstrings like a lovesick gondolier. It's a city that's simultaneously infuriating and utterly irresistible, like a beautiful woman with a terrible temper. You know you should probably leave, but you just can't quite bring yourself to do it.
