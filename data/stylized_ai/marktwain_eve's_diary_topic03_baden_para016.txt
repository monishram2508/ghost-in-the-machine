Baden, they call it. Baden-Baden, to be exact, as if to emphatically double-stamp its reputation as a place for coddling and cures. Cures, mind you, mostly for ailments I suspect are brought on by too much rich food and the relentless pursuit of pleasure. One breathes the air there, and it's thicker than gravy, heavy with the scent of roses, damp stone, and the faint but undeniable aroma of money. Grand dukes have been coming here for centuries, and judging by the lingering atmosphere of self-importance, you'd think they were still holding court, dispensing pronouncements on the proper angle for one's walking stick and the acceptable diameter of a cucumber sandwich.

The Kursaal, that gilded monstrosity, is the heart of it all. A gambling den disguised as a palace, where fortunes are won and, far more frequently, lost, all under the watchful gaze of allegorical paintings depicting the triumph of something or other – probably the triumph of the house advantage. One observes the players, flushed and frantic, clutching their chips as if they were the last raft in a deluge of bad decisions, and one can't help but feel a pang of sympathy, quickly followed by a healthy dose of amusement. For is there anything quite so human as the unwavering belief that one is just one more spin away from riches?

The ladies, bless their hearts, parade about in finery that would make a peacock blush, dripping in jewels and suffocated in whalebone. They flutter and fan themselves, exchanging gossip that could curdle milk and eyeing potential suitors with the practiced skill of a seasoned marksman. The whole scene is a delightful, if somewhat absurd, tableau of vanity and self-deception. One could spend a week simply observing the spectacle, chronicling the follies and foibles of the privileged few, and emerge with enough material to fill a dozen volumes. But then, one would have to endure the endless round of dinners and dances, and honestly, the thought alone is enough to drive a man to seek refuge in a quiet corner with a bottle of something strong and a good book. Baden, I daresay, is best enjoyed in small doses, like a particularly rich dessert – delightful, but ultimately, a bit much to swallow whole.
