Brigham, now there was a character, a regular Moses in homespun, leading his flock across a desert that made the Sahara look like a well-watered garden. Salt Lake City, they called it, and by gum, it *was* salty, though not in the way you’d think. The whole place reeked of hard work and piety, a blend that could either knock you flat with its earnestness or tickle you to death with its sheer audacity. You see, Brigham, he wasn’t just building a city, he was building an empire of faith, brick by tedious brick, and wife by…well, enough wives to populate a decent-sized town all by himself. The man had a talent for multiplication, I’ll grant him that, though whether it extended to the spiritual or simply the domestic realm, I ain’t entirely sure.

He had that look about him, Brigham, the one that said, "I know something you don't, and by thunder, you'll find out soon enough, one way or another." A glint in his eye, like a cat watching a particularly plump mouse, and a way of speaking that could turn the driest sermon into a captivating fireside chat. He was a practical sort too, Brigham, not one for fancy philosophical mumblings. Got a desert? Irrigate it. Need a city? Build it, by hook or by crook, and damn the naysayers. And there were naysayers aplenty, mark my words. But try telling Brigham something couldn’t be done; you might as well try arguing with a mule about the merits of ballet. He'd just nod, give you that knowing look, and then go right ahead and do it anyway, probably while humming a hymn and overseeing the construction of another tabernacle. He was a force of nature, that Brigham, a human tornado disguised as a religious leader, and you either got swept up in his whirlwind or found yourself watching him go, wondering what in tarnation you just witnessed. A peculiar fellow, no doubt, but the kind of peculiar that changes the landscape, whether you like it or not.
