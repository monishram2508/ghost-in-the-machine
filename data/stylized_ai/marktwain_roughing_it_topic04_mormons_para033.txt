Well, I reckon I spent a spell out in Utah Territory, enough to get a squint at them Mormons and their goings-on. A peculiar bunch, ain’t they? Building their grand Tabernacle, organ pipes lookin' like a petrified forest on end. They got this fellow Brigham Young, a plumb impressive man – more wives than commandments, I wager, and each one workin' harder than a prospector sniffin' for gold dust. He run that place like a well-oiled wagon, keepin’ the saints in line with a fire-and-brimstone sermon one minute and a practical irrigation plan the next. He was a proper dictator, but then again, someone had to be, to keep that wildcat territory from swallowin' them whole.

Now, this here Mormon religion, it's got a bit of everything thrown in, like a miner's stew. They claim an angel come down and give their leader a new book written on gold plates, buried right here in the good old US of A, imagine that! I ain’t never seen no golden scriptures meself, but then again, I ain’t never seen a jackalope neither, and some folks swear by them. Their doctrine is a bit like a braided rope – got strands of the Bible, a dash of common sense, and a whole heap of their own making. They got this idea about baptizing folks after they’re dead, which seems a fair bit late in the day to me, seeing as they ain’t likely to complain about the temperature of the water. The whole thing is strange enough, but they seem happy enough, singing their hymns and workin’ their farms. Can’t fault a man for his beliefs, long as he ain’t tryin’ to sell you swampland on the strength of ‘em. Besides, they were hospitable, always ready with a slice of apple pie and a tall tale or two. All in all, I’d say they’re a sight better than some of the fellers I met out West, even if their notions do make a body scratch his head and wonder.
