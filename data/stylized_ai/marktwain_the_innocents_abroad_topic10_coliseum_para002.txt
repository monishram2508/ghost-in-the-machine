Now, the Coliseum, that ancient amphitheater in Rome, is quite the spectacle, a hulking brute of a building that's seen more bloodshed than a Mississippi riverboat gambler's poker table on a Saturday night. It's a ruin, mind you, a magnificent one, though. You can almost hear the roar of the crowd, the clash of steel, and the mournful bleating of Christians being unceremoniously introduced to the digestive systems of particularly enthusiastic lions, though I daresay those lions probably preferred zebra. They say gladiators fought in there, trained chaps who knew how to brandish a sword and look dramatically at the emperor, hoping for a reprieve. Though, if you ask me, fighting for your life in front of a bunch of bored senators and toga-clad spectators isn't much of an incentive, no sir. 

It’s a grand old pile of stones, but it lacks what one might call modern comforts. No padded seats, no lemonade vendors hawking their wares, and I don’t recall seeing a single public restroom. One shudders to think of the state of affairs after a particularly well-attended gladiatorial bout. They say emperors held mock naval battles within its walls, flooding the arena and pitting ships against each other. Now, that's what I call extravagance! Think of the plumbing involved! It would have been cheaper, and surely more entertaining, to just pay everyone to throw buckets of water at each other. The sheer waste! Still, the place stands, a testament to Roman engineering, bloodlust, and a general lack of anything better to do on a Sunday afternoon. You can climb all over it for a few lira, dodge the pigeons, and imagine yourself as a conquering hero, or, more likely, a snack for a hungry lion. Just be careful where you step; some of those stones are mighty slippery, and falling into a pile of ancient rubble isn’t nearly as romantic as it sounds.
