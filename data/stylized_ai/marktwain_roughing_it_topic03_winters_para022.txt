Winter in these here parts? Now, that’s a spectacle. Not like them fancy, perfumed winters back East, mind you, where a flurry might be considered a catastrophe and folks clutch their furs like they're shielding the Crown Jewels from a bandit raid. Out here, winter's got grit, a downright cantankerous streak, you might say. She comes sweeping down from the mountains, a regular blizzard of a woman, and flings snow around like she’s got a vendetta against the landscape. First thing you know, you're knee-deep in the stuff, and the wind's howling like a coyote choir on a bender.

The sun, bless its little heart, puts in a few appearances, but it's mostly a pale imitation of itself, sort of like a stagecoach actor playing a king; you know he’s trying, but there ain't much authority to it. And the cold? Why, it'll seep into your bones and set up housekeeping there, refusing to pay rent. You’ll find yourself bundled up in so many layers you waddle like a penguin with indigestion, and still you'll be shivering like a dog passing peach seeds.

And the folks? They get a bit peculiar, too. Conversations dwindle down to grunts and pronouncements about the price of firewood. The saloons, though, ah, the saloons thrive. Whiskey sales skyrocket, and men gather round the stove, spinning yarns taller than a sequoia and arguing about the best way to catch a snowshoe hare (which, by the way, nobody ever seems to actually do). It’s a time of hibernating, of waiting for the cantankerous snow-woman to finally pack her bags and clear out, leaving behind a world soggy and repentant, ready for the grudging return of spring. It's a rough affair, winter, no question about that. But it’s a sight, all the same, and you wouldn't trade it for a box seat at the opera, not by a long shot. Because out here, even suffering's got a certain… character.
