Heidelberg! A town clinging to the hillside like ivy on an ancient ruin – and indeed, much of it *is* an ancient ruin, particularly that grandiose, crumbling castle perched precariously above the Neckar. One half expects the whole dilapidated affair to come tumbling down, showering the town with bits of gargoyle and shattered sandstone. But no, there it sits, defying gravity and good sense, just like the German language itself. The students, bless their beery hearts, seem quite fond of the place. They wander about in their outlandish caps, sporting colors that would make a rainbow blush, and bellowing songs that sound suspiciously like distressed yodeling. It is said they drink copious amounts of beer, which I can readily believe, given the abundance of beer gardens overflowing with humanity. They seem a cheerful lot, these students, though I suspect their cheerfulness is chemically induced. The town, however, is undeniably picturesque. Cobblestone streets twist and turn like a cat chasing its tail, leading you past half-timbered houses that lean together as if sharing secrets. Every other shop, it seems, sells cuckoo clocks or sausage, which rather sums up the German aesthetic, does it not? Cuckoo clocks and sausage – time and sustenance, the cornerstones of a well-lived, if slightly monotonous, life. I found myself pondering, as I stood on the old bridge, watching the Neckar slither by like a green ribbon, whether the celebrated beauty of Heidelberg was genuinely inherent, or merely enhanced by the sheer weight of romantic expectation piled upon it over the centuries. Probably a bit of both, I suspect. One can’t deny the charm of the place, even if one *is* constantly dodging horse-drawn carriages driven by men who seem to consider tourists fair game for near-fatal collisions. Yes, Heidelberg, a delightful, slightly crumbling, beer-soaked, cuckoo-clock-ticking sort of place. A town for poets and drunkards, and, I suppose, the occasional moderately observant American traveler.
