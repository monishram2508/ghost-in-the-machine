Well, I declare, a portier! Fancy that! Here I am, a poor woman, accustomed to the simplicity of Eden (though Adam tells me that's ever so unfashionable now, with its lack of parlors and such), and now I'm faced with a thing that's neither quite a door nor quite a tapestry, but a sort of…dramatic curtain, meant to keep out the drafts, or so Adam mumbled. He did say, with a twinkle in his eye that would make a serpent jealous, it adds a certain…*je ne sais quoi*, he called it, a French phrase which I gather translates to "something I can't explain but will certainly charge you dearly for later."

It's all very perplexing, you see. Back home, in our humble garden abode, the wind had free reign, and we were none the worse for it. We danced with the leaves and let the sun kiss our bare skin, never a thought given to such finery. But this portier, with its heavy velvet and elaborate fringe, it seems to be saying "Stay back, wind! This is a room of consequence!" As if consequence were something worth barring the door for, when the greatest consequence of all is that which we face every day just living.

And the cost! Goodness gracious, you'd think it was woven from spun gold rather than mere fabric. Adam swore it would pay for itself in saved firewood, a notion I find as improbable as him learning to cook a decent apple pie. Still, I suppose it does add a certain something to the room, a touch of…well, pomp, I suppose. It makes a body feel as though they've stepped into a stage play, all dramatic entrances and exits. Though I do worry, what if it gets dusty? Who's going to clean it, I ask you? I bet Adam thinks some little fairy with a golden duster will come along, when really it'll be poor Eve with a step ladder and a sneeze, dusting the consequence right off of it.
