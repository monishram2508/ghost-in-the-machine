Chamonix, bless its charming little heart, is a place that appears to have been squeezed directly from a picture book and set down amongst the most monstrously arrogant mountains I’ve ever laid eyes upon. One minute you're enjoying a perfectly adequate cup of something they call "café crème" (which, if you ask me, tastes suspiciously like dishwater pretending to be fancy), the next you're crane-necking at Mont Blanc, that grand old blusterer, which looms so large it threatens to knock the pompadour right off my head. They say it inspires awe, that mountain, and perhaps it does in more susceptible souls. Me? I'm mainly concerned with whether my hotel window can withstand a sudden avalanche of self-importance.

The town itself is a warren of cobbled streets, seemingly designed to trip up visiting Americans laden with cameras and sporting inexplicably loud trousers. Shops abound, bursting with enough mountaineering equipment to conquer the moon, though most of it seems to be purchased by tourists who will never venture beyond the conveniently placed ice cream stand. The locals, a hardy bunch, regard these expeditions with a mixture of amusement and thinly veiled contempt. They, of course, were born practically wearing crampons and know the mountains as well as they know the best recipe for cheese fondue, a dish I suspect is at least partially responsible for the town's remarkable lack of tumbleweeds. And the tourists, well, they continue to flock like moths to a particularly perilous flame, eager to risk life and limb (or at least a twisted ankle) for the privilege of saying they once shared oxygen with a glacier. I, naturally, prefer to risk only a slight indigestion, brought on by overindulging in the aforementioned fondue, all the while observing the human comedy unfold from the relative safety of a well-upholstered chair. It is, after all, a far more comfortable ascent.
