Chamonix, they call it. A little village squatted beneath the implacable gaze of Mont Blanc, a peak so lofty it likely considers the whole affair a trivial nuisance. I suppose I understand why folk flock here, drawn to the mountains like moths to a particularly stubborn, un-extinguishable candle. You see them everywhere, decked out in garments so brightly colored they resemble a flock of escaped parrots, all determinedly marching towards…well, upwards, mostly. They strap planks to their feet in the winter, presumably to improve their odds of sliding down the aforementioned mountain with greater dispatch, and in summer, they attach themselves to ropes and attempt to scale the thing, inch by excruciating inch. It is a curious business, this mountain-worship. Seems to me, a perfectly comfortable chair and a glass of something agreeable offers a far more sensible afternoon activity.

One observes, of course, a certain desperation in their pursuit. They puff and pant, sweat glistens, their faces contorted in grim determination, and for what? A fleeting vista, a moment of breathless triumph, then the laborious descent once more. I'd wager a good cigar that most of them would rather be sipping a vin chaud back in the village, swapping exaggerated tales of daring deeds and near-fatal slips. But no, pride, that most absurd of human foibles, demands they conquer the unyielding rock. And bless their stubborn little hearts for trying. Chamonix itself is charming enough, I suppose, in a postcard sort of way, with its quaint chalets and shops peddling trinkets designed to commemorate the ordeal. The prices, naturally, are elevated to match the altitude. One expects to pay dearly for the privilege of witnessing such organized suffering. Even the air, thin and crisp, seems to whisper a subtle accusation of idleness to those of us who choose to remain firmly planted on terra firma. But I say, let them climb. Let them conquer. I shall remain here, contentedly observing the madness, with perhaps another glass of vin chaud, and a quiet chuckle at the folly of mankind. After all, someone must stay behind to tell the tale, and embellish it appropriately.
