Carson City, they call it, though why "city" I reckon only the government and a few stubborn lawyers know. It ain't much to look at, I tell you, a scattering of frame buildings that look like they lost a fight with the desert wind, huddled against the backdrop of the Sierra Nevada like shivering sheep. The main street? Well, it's wide enough for a freight wagon to turn around, which is a good thing, seeing as how freight wagons are about the only excitement that dares to grace it on a regular basis. They say gold and silver built this place, but you wouldn't know it by the looks of the houses; seems like the miners, bless their greedy hearts, took all the shine with them down to Virginia City, leaving Carson with the dregs and the dust.

The legislature meets here, of all places, presumably to decide whether to charge extra for water or whether to let the sagebrush grow tall enough to hide a man. They make a lot of noise, those fellows, stamping and hollering like a pack of coyotes caught in a chicken coop, but I'll be hornswoggled if I ever saw them actually *do* anything useful. The saloons, now, those are another matter entirely. They're lively places, filled with the clatter of chips, the mournful wail of a banjo, and enough whiskey to float a battleship. A man can lose his fortune there, or find a new one, depending on his luck and the sobriety of the dealer. And the characters! Carson is full of 'em: grizzled prospectors with eyes that have seen too much dust, smooth-talking con men with smiles that could charm a rattlesnake, and ladies of the evening who are, shall we say, more enthusiastic than refined. It's a hodgepodge of humanity, all looking for something - gold, women, a moment of peace - and most of 'em, if you ask me, looking in the wrong place. But that's the beauty of Carson, ain't it? A place where dreams go to die, or, just maybe, to be born again, covered in grit and smelling faintly of sagebrush and cheap whiskey.
