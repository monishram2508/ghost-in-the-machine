Higbie, Michigan, a virtually vanished community nestled in the heart of Manistee County, offers a poignant glimpse into the fleeting nature of resource-dependent settlements. Once a bustling lumber town on the shores of Lake Michigan, Higbie's story is interwoven with the rise and fall of the timber industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Founded by, and named after, Chauncey Higbie, the town capitalized on its strategic location near vast pine forests, becoming a hub for logging operations. Sawmills churned relentlessly, transforming towering trees into lumber that fueled the burgeoning economies of the Midwest. A small, but vibrant community blossomed, complete with homes, general stores, a post office, and even a school, all tethered to the promise of seemingly endless timber resources. The Higbie Manufacturing Company, Chauncey’s main business, was the economic engine that drove the town’s prosperity.

The allure of Higbie, however, proved to be ephemeral. As the surrounding forests were depleted, the economic foundation that sustained the town began to crumble. The sawmills, the lifeblood of the community, gradually fell silent. With the trees gone, the men left in search of new employment. By the early 20th century, Higbie's population dwindled significantly, its structures falling into disrepair and succumbing to the elements. Today, little remains of the once-thriving town beyond scattered foundations, overgrown remnants of roads, and fading memories passed down through generations. The location is now considered a ghost town, a testament to the boom-and-bust cycles that characterized Michigan's lumber era. The area where Higbie once stood has largely reverted back to nature, a quiet reminder of the community that once called it home. While few physical traces endure, the story of Higbie serves as a valuable lesson about the importance of sustainable resource management and the lasting consequences of unchecked exploitation. It whispers of the human ambition and resourcefulness that built a community, and the inevitable decline that followed its reliance on a finite resource.
