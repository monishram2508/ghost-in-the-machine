Gibraltar, bless its rocky, sun-baked heart, is a spectacle, I tell you, a proper humbug of a place. Imagine, if you will, a lion cub, all bristling pride, yet chained to its mother’s apron strings – Mother England, in this case, naturally. Here sits this monstrous geological carbuncle, jutting out of Spain like a thumb daring the Spanish to pull it, and daring them for, lo, these many years. One half expects the entire peninsula to simply up and walk away, back to Blighty, but no. It stays put, a stubborn little reminder of empires past, and a thriving reminder that England still has that imperial ambition.

The town itself is a riot of cobbled streets and duty-free shops, a magnet for tourists and sailors alike, all eager to liberate themselves from the burdensome obligation of paying taxes. One can purchase a cask of whiskey for a pittance, enough to drown one's sorrows or, perhaps, fuel a particularly spirited disagreement about the rightful ownership of the place. And the monkeys! Ah, those Barbary apes, the scoundrels of the Rock. They are bold, impudent, and possess an uncanny knack for pilfering anything that isn't nailed down or guarded by a fierce bulldog. One fellow told me he'd witnessed a particularly brazen ape snatch a wig right off a lady's head and, after a moment's contemplation, attempt to fashion a crude nest out of it. One wonders if the apes are perhaps in cahoots with the shopkeepers, the wig-snatching serving as an ingenious advertisement for their, I shudder to say, toupee collections.

And the view! From atop that monstrous rock, one can gaze across the straits to Africa, imagining all manner of exotic adventures and perilous journeys. Though, truth be told, I was rather more concerned with not plummeting to my doom, the wind being rather frisky on that particular day. The whole affair leaves one feeling rather perplexed, you see. A tiny slice of England, clinging precariously to the edge of Europe, populated by tax-dodgers, whiskey-swillers, and thieving apes. A glorious, improbable, utterly unforgettable absurdity, I tell you.
