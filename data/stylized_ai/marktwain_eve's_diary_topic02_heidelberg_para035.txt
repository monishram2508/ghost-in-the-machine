Heidelberg! Ach, Heidelberg! A town draped upon the Neckar like a lovelorn maiden’s shawl, forever attempting (and failing, bless its picturesque heart) to appear nonchalant about the grand, ruined castle perched so gloriously, so dramatically, overhead. One half expects the old ruin to wink conspiratorially, knowing full well that it is the very reason tourists, like moths to a particularly fetching flame, flock here in droves. They come, these sightseers, armed with cameras and a determination to be thoroughly, romantically overwhelmed. And overwhelmed they are, though I suspect half of them are more impressed by the size of the Heidelberg Tun, a behemoth of a wine barrel capable, they say, of holding enough Riesling to float a small naval vessel. I confess, the sheer audacity of such a vessel is more intoxicating than any fermented grape.

The town itself is a confection, a sugary pastry shop of cobblestone streets and gabled houses, each one seemingly vying for the title of "Most Delightfully Quaint." It is a perpetual stage set for a student operetta, filled with young men sporting dueling scars (a truly barbaric custom, I must say, but one that lends a certain… gravitas… to a fellow’s profile) and comely young ladies clutching books of poetry and aspirations to artistic genius. The air hums with the melody of half-remembered ballads, the clinking of beer steins, and the hushed murmurings of lovers’ promises whispered in German, a language that, when spoken by the young and amorous, can make even the most mundane sentiment sound profoundly philosophical. I observed one young couple, locked in an embrace so fervent it threatened to topple a nearby flower box, utterly oblivious to the throngs pushing past. Bless their hearts, I thought, they are living proof that even in a place so steeped in history and legend, the oldest story of all – the one about a heart that finds its mate – continues to unfold with predictable, and utterly captivating, regularity. One can’t help but wonder if the old castle looks down upon them all, chuckling to itself about the endless cycle of romance, ruin, and the enduring power of a really, really large wine barrel.
