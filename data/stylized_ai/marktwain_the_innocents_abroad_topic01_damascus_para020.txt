Now, Damascus, there's a city that could charm the stripes off a zebra, provided, of course, one hadn't seen too many zebras beforehand. They claim it's the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, and I wouldn't doubt it for a moment. Why, Noah himself probably stopped there for a bite to eat after that unfortunate boating incident, complaining, no doubt, about the lack of decent wine on the ark. You see, time hasn’t precisely been kind to the place in the way some might think of a well-aged cheese, though it’s certainly developed a pungent character of its own. The air hangs thick with dust and the aroma of spices – enough to make a fellow sneeze with historical significance. The streets are a labyrinth of narrow alleys, so crooked and winding that a snake would get lost trying to slither through them. One might think the city planners designed it intentionally to confuse invaders, or perhaps they simply had a penchant for chaos.

The people, ah, the people of Damascus! They are a study in contrasts, as baffling as a riddle wrapped in an enigma and stuffed into a baklava. One minute they’ll be haggling with you over the price of a rug like their very lives depend on it, driving the price down to a point where you're convinced they’re practically giving it away out of pity. The next, they'll offer you a cup of sweet, strong coffee and regale you with stories that stretch back to the time of Haroun al-Raschid. I swear, their stories seem to have an expiration date of around the year 800 AD, or whenever the coffee's gone. The city is as old as some of the stories they tell, and probably just as trustworthy. But, there you have it folks, Damascus, a place where history is as thick as the dust, and the only way to truly understand it is to get lost in it, one winding alley and suspiciously cheap rug at a time. Just mind your pockets.
