Chamonix, bless its little heart, is a place where man, feeling a sudden urge to commune with the Almighty – or, perhaps more likely, to prove he’s less chicken than that loudmouth Reginald from the yacht club – hurls himself at a mountain that looks like it was built by giants and seasoned with snow. It's quite the spectacle, I assure you. The air up there is thinner than a politician's promise, and colder than a mother-in-law’s gaze upon her daughter’s choice of husband. Folks arrive bundled up like so many esquimaux, weighed down with enough metal and rope to build a bridge across the Mississippi, all for the privilege of scaling a frosted hunk of rock where even the eagles have to think twice. They call it "mountaineering," but I suspect it's closer to a contest of sheer will against gravity, hypothermia, and the constant, nagging fear that you're about to become a permanent fixture on the scenery.

The town itself is a charming little thing, choked with shops selling equipment that promises to defy death, restaurants serving cheese dishes rich enough to stop a clock, and tourists snapping photographs as if Mont Blanc were about to vanish in a puff of smoke. You see, Chamonix, it seems, is a place where one can simultaneously witness the sublime and the ridiculous, the breathtaking and the faintly absurd. The men swagger around with their ice axes like triumphant warriors, while their wives, poor dears, wander the boutiques, purchasing trinkets and hoping their husbands don't become a headline in the local gazette. One can partake in the thrill of gazing upwards, at the peak, or downwards at the bank account getting lighter with each new mountaineering related trinket. A visit to the grand and glorious Chamonix is certainly an adventure, whether one chooses to take on the challenge of scaling the mountain, or merely observe the lunacy from a safe, heated distance, preferably with a glass of something fortified in hand.
