A glacier is a colossal, enduring river of ice formed over centuries or millennia by the gradual accumulation, compaction, and recrystallization of snow. These icy behemoths are not static entities; instead, they are dynamic systems constantly responding to changes in climate and gravity. Glaciers exist in regions where snowfall consistently exceeds snowmelt, typically at high altitudes or latitudes. As snow accumulates, the weight of the overlying layers compresses the lower layers, squeezing out air and transforming the delicate snowflakes into dense, granular ice known as firn. Continued compression eventually transforms the firn into glacial ice, a solid mass capable of flowing under its own weight. The movement of a glacier is driven primarily by gravity, with the ice deforming internally through a process called plastic flow. This internal deformation, coupled with basal sliding where the glacier's base is lubricated by meltwater, allows the glacier to advance, retreat, or remain relatively stable depending on the balance between accumulation and ablation.

Glaciers sculpt the landscape through erosion, transportation, and deposition. As they move, glaciers scour the underlying bedrock, plucking away rocks and debris. These materials, ranging from fine silt to massive boulders, are then carried within or on the surface of the ice, acting as abrasive tools that further erode the valley floor and walls. The power of a glacier can carve out deep U-shaped valleys, leaving behind telltale signs of glaciation, such as striations (scratches on bedrock), cirques (bowl-shaped depressions), and hanging valleys. When the glacier eventually melts or retreats, it deposits the accumulated sediments in the form of moraines (ridges of unsorted sediment), erratics (large, out-of-place boulders), and outwash plains (broad, flat areas composed of glacial meltwater deposits). These glacial features provide invaluable evidence of past glacial activity and serve as reminders of the powerful forces that shape our planet. Furthermore, glaciers are vital freshwater reservoirs, storing vast quantities of water in solid form. The meltwater released from glaciers contributes significantly to river flow, providing a crucial source of water for drinking, irrigation, and hydroelectric power, especially in mountainous regions. The health and stability of glaciers are therefore intrinsically linked to human well-being and the health of the global ecosystem.
