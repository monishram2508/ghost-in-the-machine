Damascus, bless its ancient heart, is a city that makes you feel as though you've stepped straight into a biblical picture book, albeit one illustrated by a particularly eccentric fellow with a fondness for dust and donkeys. Why, I swear I half expected Noah himself to amble past on a camel, grumbling about the price of wood these days. The streets? A tangled web of alleys so narrow, a fat man would have to turn sideways and apologize profusely to the buildings for scraping them. And the smells! My stars, the smells! A glorious, pungent cocktail of jasmine, spices that could raise the dead, and something… something vaguely resembling a camel's discarded sock. Not unpleasant, mind you, just… distinct. One acquires a taste, as they say, though I confess I'm still pondering what dipping sauce might complement a camel sock.

The people, ah, the people! They're a curious bunch, ever ready with a smile, a cup of overly sweet tea, and a price that seems suspiciously high for both. Haggling is not merely a transaction here, it's a sacred art form, a dance of wit and stubbornness where both parties emerge exhausted but strangely satisfied. I once spent a full hour arguing over the price of a rug that probably cost less to make than the time I wasted haggling for it. But that’s Damascus for you – time is a river that flows at a leisurely pace, and urgency is a foreign concept best left at the city gates. And the ruins, oh, the glorious ruins! They stand like ancient, sun-baked storytellers, whispering tales of empires risen and fallen, of conquerors and poets, of the countless dramas that have played out on this very stage. Though, I must say, I did trip over a Roman column while trying to take a photograph. Served me right, I suppose, for attempting to capture eternity with a contraption that's barely lasted past breakfast. But all in all, Damascus is a place that gets under your skin, a dusty, chaotic, utterly charming city that will leave you feeling as though you've lived a thousand years, even if you've only stayed for a week. And I, for one, wouldn't trade the experience for all the tea in China – though I might consider a slightly less aromatic sock in my next cup.
