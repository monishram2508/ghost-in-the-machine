Genoa, ah, a city clinging to the Ligurian coast like a barnacle to a brigantine's hull. A veritable warren of narrow streets they possess, so convoluted and twisting that a man could lose his hat and his wits in equal measure before finding his way back to the harbor. I've navigated the Mississippi in a fog thicker than a Welshman's accent, but these *caruggi*, as they're fancifully called, present a far greater challenge. One suspects they were designed not for ease of passage, but to confound invaders, or perhaps to keep the Genovese themselves perpetually disoriented, lest they get too puffed up with notions of grandeur. Palaces aplenty stand shoulder to shoulder with tenements that look as though they might crumble at the slightest provocation, a delightful juxtaposition of opulence and genteel decay, a reminder that even the most magnificent fortunes are but fleeting.

The harbor, of course, is the city's heart, a chaotic ballet of fishing boats, merchantmen, and the occasional dreadnought, all jostling for space like so many hogs at a trough. The air hangs thick with the smells of brine, fish, and something indefinably…old. A smell, one might say, of centuries of commerce and ambition, a fragrance that could wrinkle your nose or inspire you to conquer the world, depending on your temperament. And the Genovese themselves! A shrewd lot, they are. I wouldn't wager a farthing against a Genovese merchant in a trade, for they are sharper than a cheese grater and just as likely to leave you feeling a bit raw. They have a way of looking at you that suggests they know something you don't, and probably do. They are, in short, masters of the art of getting the best of a bargain, a trait that has served them well through the ages, and which, I suspect, will continue to do so long after the rest of us are pushing up daisies. One can find a good bargain in Genoa, that's assured. Whether the *bargain* is good for you, well, that’s entirely another matter.
