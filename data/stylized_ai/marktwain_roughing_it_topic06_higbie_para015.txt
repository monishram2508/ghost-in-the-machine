Higbie, now there was a specimen for the curious naturalist. You could find him propped up against the Blue Wing Saloon at nearly any hour, looking like a particularly lonesome tumbleweed that had somehow sprouted a bristly mustache and a set of eyes that could bore a hole clean through a mule. He was a man of few words, Higbie was, unless you happened to catch him just after he’d discovered the whiskey jug. Then, why, he'd spin yarns that would make Baron Munchausen himself blush with envy. He claimed to have once wrestled a grizzly bear for a gold nugget the size of a goose egg, though the grizzly was probably a mangy coyote and the nugget, I suspect, a particularly smooth pebble. Higbie had a heart of gold, buried deep, deep down, somewhere beneath layers of cynicism and a decided aversion to bathing. He possessed a stubborn streak that could bend railroad tracks and a capacity for idleness that would make a sloth look like a bustling entrepreneur. He was also the self-proclaimed "King of the Comstock Lode," a title generally conferred upon him by himself, and accepted by no one with even a passing acquaintance with the actual Comstock Lode. His kingdom consisted mostly of a dilapidated shack, a rusty pickaxe, and a claim that he’d been meaning to work on for the last twenty years. Still, there was a certain grandeur to Higbie, a ramshackle majesty in his utter lack of ambition and his unwavering belief that one day, he'd strike it rich. He reminded me of those old prospectors you'd see wandering the desert, convinced that the motherlode was just over the next ridge, eternally chasing the phantom of fortune. He was a character, Higbie was, a genuine article of the West, and one of those fellows you couldn't help but like, even if you wouldn’t trust him to hold onto a ten-dollar bill.
