Now, about this mosque business. A body might wander in, expecting, well, I don't rightly know what. Maybe a hushed stillness, like a church after the collection plate’s gone 'round, or perhaps a clatter of tongues you get after a particularly rousing sermon. But no, it ain't quite either. It's a queer sort of quiet, like a cat waiting for a mouse, full of potential but outwardly calm. These Muslims, they take off their boots, mind you – a sensible precaution, I always say, considering the distances some folks walk in this world. Then they shuffle inside, line up neat as pins in a cushion, and commence to bowing and scraping. Reminds me of a well-trained flock of sheep, if I'm being honest, though I suppose the sheep don't generally face Mecca.

And the architecture! Now, that’s something worth a gander. Those domes, rounded like a well-fed merchant's belly, reaching for the heavens. A man might wonder what secrets they hold, though likely it’s just air and echoes, same as anywhere else. And the calligraphy, swirling and dancing on the walls like vines trying to escape the stonework. I reckon a fella could stare at it for days and still not decipher a single blasted word. But it’s right pretty, all the same. Gives the place a touch of the exotic, like a traveling circus come to town. Folks mumble and kneel, some with tears in their eyes, others with faces blank as a poker player holding a bad hand. Makes a man ponder on the mysteries of belief, and how easily a well-placed story can get a whole lot of people doing the same peculiar thing. And when it's all over, they put their boots back on, same as they took 'em off, and shuffle back out into the world, presumably to haggle at the market and argue about politics, same as the rest of us poor sinners. The Lord works in mysterious ways, they say, and I suppose building a fancy building to bow down in is as good a way as any to try and figure Him out.
