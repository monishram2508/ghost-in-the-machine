Now, concerning these mosques, these edifices of elaborate piety, they’re quite the spectacle, ain’t they? Like a peacock strutting about the barnyard, all feathers and show. I recall stumbling upon one in Constantinople, or Istanbul, or whatever moniker tickles their fancy these days. It was grand, mind you, grand enough to make a Methodist church blush with shame. Minarets, those slender fellows poking at the sky, stood tall like boastful sentries, no doubt keeping watch for any wandering infidels, such as myself. The insides were a veritable kaleidoscope of colours, patterns so intricate they’d make a spider weep with envy. Rugs aplenty, thicker than a politician's lies, stretched out for what seemed an eternity, just begging to be walked upon by slippered feet, presumably belonging to the faithful.

And speaking of the faithful, what a sight they were! Kneeling, bowing, muttering their prayers with a devotion that would put a Baptist preacher to shame. I couldn’t help but wonder what sort of bargains they were striking with the Almighty. Were they promising to give up gambling? Perhaps swearing off strong drink, or at least watering it down a bit? One could only speculate. The air was thick with incense, a scent that tickled the nose and made one feel rather… holy. Or perhaps that was just the lingering fumes from the kebab stand I'd frequented earlier. Hard to tell, really.

The whole affair struck me as rather theatrical, if I'm being honest. All that pomp and circumstance, the elaborate rituals… it was almost like attending a particularly well-rehearsed play, except instead of applause, one got knowing nods and hushed "Allah Akbar" whispers. Still, one has to admire the dedication, the unwavering belief. It’s a commitment most folks wouldn't extend to their morning coffee, let alone to a higher power. And who am I to judge? After all, everyone’s got their own way of attempting to make sense of this world, their own particular brand of peacock feathers to preen.
