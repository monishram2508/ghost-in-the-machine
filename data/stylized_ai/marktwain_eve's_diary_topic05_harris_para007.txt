Harris, now there’s a fellow you could build a steamboat around, mostly for the amusement of watching it sink. I met him up the river, in that God-forsaken town of Hannibal, Missouri – a place so dreary even the mosquitoes seemed to have a touch of melancholy. Harris, bless his heart, was full of grand schemes and half-baked notions, like a pie left too long in the sun. He fancied himself a connoisseur of the arts, particularly anything involving a banjo and a tune that sounded suspiciously like a cat fight. He claimed he could tell a genuine Stradivarius from a cigar box with strings by the very *air* it breathed, though I suspect his keenest sense was for the proximity of a free meal.

He was a storyteller, too, Harris was, of the sort that left you wondering if the truth had ever been introduced to him. He’d spin yarns about steamboat races where he single-handedly saved the day by shoveling bacon grease into the furnace, or about encounters with Indians so noble they could’ve taught nobility to the Queen of England. One tale involved a catfish the size of a parlor piano, that he wrestled bare-handed, only to release it back into the river to – and I quote – “spread the joy of its magnificent girth.” I always figured that catfish, if it existed at all, was probably still laughing somewhere downstream, telling its own version of the story.

But you couldn’t help but like him, Harris. He had that certain charm, a sort of innocent deviltry that made you overlook his blatant disregard for reality. He was the sort of man who'd borrow your last dollar, tell you he'd struck gold, and then spend it all on a scheme to teach squirrels to tap dance. You knew you were being bamboozled, and yet you'd somehow end up chuckling along with him, wondering what outlandish adventure he'd concoct next. He was a walking, talking paradox, a blend of pure guile and genuine, if misguided, enthusiasm. A plague, perhaps, but a rather entertaining one.
