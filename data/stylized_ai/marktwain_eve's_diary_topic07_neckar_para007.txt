The Neckar, bless its heart, is a river, or at least it aspires to be. One wouldn't call it exactly rambunctious, not like the Mississippi, which is always up to some kind of mud-slinging mischief. The Neckar, you see, is more of a ponderous, polite sort, meandering through the German landscape like a portly professor contemplating a particularly tricky theorem. It ambles past Heidelberg, where one might expect it to pick up a bit of scholastic rigor, perhaps absorb some Latin or at least a decent vocabulary, but no, it seems content to merely reflect the castle's romantic ruins with a mournful sigh, as if remembering its own misspent youth. One imagines the river saying, "Ah, youth! Wasted on the young…and also on me, apparently."

It’s populated, they say, by fish of indeterminate species, all likely related and sporting that perpetually surprised look common to river-dwelling fauna. I wouldn't dare attempt to catch one; knowing my luck, I’d reel in some ancient carp who speaks only High German and insists on reciting Goethe. The barges, of course, lumber along like patient beasts of burden, carrying their loads of coal and gravel, oblivious to the scenery. One wonders if they ever stop to admire the vineyards clinging to the hillsides or ponder the philosophical implications of being a barge. Probably not. Barges, you see, are much like politicians: focused on the task at hand and rarely troubled by introspection. But bless them, the Neckar, the barges, and even those philosophically challenged fish. They all play their part in this grand human comedy, and provide us with a gentle, if slightly sleepy, current against which to contemplate the vast and bewildering mystery that is existence. Which, come to think of it, is probably more than I've accomplished today.
