Now, concerning this portier, which Eve called a "curtain for the door," a contraption of such utter frou-frou and pretense that a body might think it was trying to disguise a perfectly good, honest hole in the wall. She draped it with velvet the color of a particularly indignant sunset, fringed it within an inch of its life, and then embroidered enough lilies upon it to make the Queen of Sheba jealous, lilies that looked, I must confess, suspiciously like overgrown onions. Adam, bless his simple heart, seemed rather taken with it, marveling at the way it billowed when he flung open the door, which, mind you, he still did with the delicacy of a woolly mammoth discovering a butterfly.

He'd stand there, framed by Eve's flamboyant folly, and proclaim, "By Jove, a most remarkable invention!" as if he'd personally witnessed the Big Bang. And Eve, naturally, would preen and flutter, claiming it added "depth" and "mystery" to the cave. As if the cave needed any more depth – it went back far enough to lose a herd of dinosaurs in, and as for mystery, well, Adam was mystery enough for any woman! The real depth, I figured, was in Eve's pocketbook, which was considerably lighter after her trip to the Silkworm Emporium. And the mystery? Why she felt the need to tart up a perfectly respectable cave dwelling with such extravagant foolishness.

But, being a man of peace (mostly), I held my tongue. It was easier, you see, than arguing the merits of a plain old bearskin against something that resembled a flamboyant stage curtain after a particularly disastrous Shakespearean production. Besides, watching Adam struggle to get through it without tripping over the fringe was amusement enough for a whole afternoon. And there was a secret, little thrill in knowing that someday, when Eve wasn't looking, I'd probably use it to swat flies. An elegant, if rather over-the-top, flyswatter, indeed.
