Now, about this Damascus, a city that's older than Methuselah's beard and twice as dusty. I've heard tell that it’s the oldest city in the world, a claim I reckon rests on the same shaky foundation as a drunk man's promises. Still, ancient it is, older than sin itself, probably. You can practically taste the history in the air, though mind you, that might just be the dust mingled with the faint aroma of dates and desperation. They say it's where Cain slew Abel, but I'm suspicious; Cain likely wanted a more private locale for such villainy, perhaps a remote cornfield somewhere out West.

I found the city a bit like a faded tapestry, once vibrant with colors of empire and intrigue, now slightly moth-eaten, but still stubbornly clinging to its threads. The streets are a tangled mess, narrower than a miser's heart, and teeming with more people than there are fleas on a mangy dog. You’ll think you’re lost, and odds are, you are, but just follow your nose, as the scent of roasting lamb and strong coffee will eventually lead you somewhere interesting. The houses lean this way and that, like gossiping old women whispering secrets across the alley, and you half-expect them to collapse in a fit of giggles at any moment.

And the merchants! Bless their scheming little hearts. They'll try to sell you the very moon if they thought you'd bite. “Finest silk in all the Orient!” they’ll bellow, holding up a piece of fabric that's clearly seen better days. You can haggle with them, of course, but it's like wrestling a greased pig in a mud pit; you're likely to get more dirty than victorious. But that’s part of the charm, you see. Damascus is a city of contradictions, a place where the sacred and the profane rub shoulders, where ancient traditions stubbornly resist the modern world. It’s a bit like trying to understand a woman – endlessly fascinating, utterly confusing, and ultimately, worth the effort, even if you end up scratching your head and wondering what in tarnation just happened.
