Brigham, now there was a fellow who could make a desert bloom – mostly with wives, I reckon, though he did manage some crops as well. Salt Lake City, you see, it sits right there, smack dab in the middle of nothing but alkali flats and sagebrush, a testament to Brigham’s grit, or perhaps his stubbornness, hard to tell which. He marched that whole passel of followers clear across the plains, following the voices in his head and the supposed divine guidance, and planted his flag right there like he owned the place. Now, I ain’t one to judge a man's religious convictions, seeing as I’ve witnessed enough outlandishness out West to fill a library, but I’ll tell you what, Brigham had a talent for organization rivaled only by an army of ants pilfering a picnic. He parceled out the land, divvied up the water rights (a matter of life and death in them parts, mind you), and kept those Mormons working like bees in a hive. They built canals and dams and plowed the stubborn earth, all the while singing hymns and probably grumbling under their breath about the heat and the crickets. He was a king, of sorts, only instead of wearing a crown, he sported a perpetual frown and a suit that looked like it had been slept in since the exodus from Illinois. Some folks whispered he was a tyrant, and maybe he was a bit rough around the edges, what with his fiery sermons and unwavering belief in his own righteousness. But you couldn’t deny the man had a vision. He saw a city where others saw only desolation, a sanctuary where others saw only hardship. And doggone it, he built it. He built it with faith and sweat and a whole lot of wives overseeing the stew pot. A peculiar institution, some might say, but out here in the territories, peculiar was just another Tuesday.
