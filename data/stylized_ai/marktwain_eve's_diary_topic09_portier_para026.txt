Well, I declare, this Portier, or “curtain” as the French would have it, is a peculiar contraption, isn’t it? Seems to me, humans are forever striving to keep things both in and out simultaneously. This Portier, hanging there like a weary old ghost in the doorway, is supposed to keep the drafts at bay, but I suspect it’s equally adept at keeping the conversation bottled up inside where it can ferment into something truly awful. Adam, bless his simple heart, thinks it’s a marvel of engineering, though I’ve noticed he’s tripped over it more times than he’s successfully passed through it. He claims it adds a certain “je ne sais quoi” to the abode, though I suspect he’s merely repeating something he overheard the serpent whisper when he was off admiring the new breed of worm.

It's a tapestry, mind you, woven with depictions of grapevines and whatnot, like some tipsy artist decided to illustrate a particularly boisterous hangover. The colors are a tad too vivid, I daresay, bordering on the garish. One almost expects the grapes to start fermenting right there in the weave, attracting fruit flies and causing all sorts of general unpleasantness. But there it hangs, a silent sentinel against the elements, and a constant reminder that we are, in fact, indoors, though the difference between inside and out grows ever fainter now that Adam has managed to cultivate a respectable patch of thistles right in the heart of the parlor. I suppose it’s all about creating a sense of boundaries, though in this new world of ours, the only real boundary seems to be the limits of Adam’s curiosity and my own dwindling patience. Still, it does lend a certain drama to entering a room, doesn't it? One must part the silken sea, as it were, and emerge, a vision of grace and beauty, if one is lucky. Or, in Adam's case, stumble through in a tangle of limbs and vines, muttering about the need for better illumination.
