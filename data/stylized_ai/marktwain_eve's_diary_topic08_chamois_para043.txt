Now, about this chamois critter, bless its pointy-eared little heart. Eve saw one prancing about up on the bluffs the other day, a regular acrobat in fur, and it set her to pondering. Seems like a right sensible beast, all things considered, even if it does insist on wearing that perpetually surprised expression. It’s got this knack for clinging to mountains that would make a fly blush, leaping from crag to crag like it’s got springs in its hooves, or maybe just a terrible fear of terra firma. And let me tell you, it’s got better fashion sense than half the peacocks I’ve seen strutting around, with that sleek, fawn-colored coat and those little hooked horns that look for all the world like punctuation marks on a particularly whimsical sentence.

Adam, naturally, tried to hunt it. Lord, the man has a one-track mind, I swear. He figured a chamois hide would make him a fine pair of breeches, which I pointed out was a grand ambition for a fellow who still runs around starkers most of the time. But you can't dissuade a man who's got a notion in his head, especially when that notion involves acquiring more things to cover his, shall we say, "modesty." Anyway, the chamois, being a sight smarter than Adam in the hunting department, just hopped further up the cliff face, giving him a look that suggested he might want to consider investing in a good pair of stilts. It just goes to show, sometimes the best way to deal with trouble is to simply be somewhere else entirely, preferably somewhere requiring a good bit of climbing. It’s a lesson some folks could learn, Adam included. I expect if we start seeing those critters wearing bonnets, he'll try to "civilize" them with some hard labor.
