Well, I reckon I’ve seen most every curiosity the good Lord saw fit to sprinkle upon this sphere, from the Grand Canyon, which is a right impressive ditch, to a sunset over the Pacific that makes you want to weep with the pretty. But glaciers, now glaciers are a different kettle of fish altogether. Imagine, if you will, a river, but one plumb frozen solid and about as fast-moving as a constipated snail. These things are grand and terrifying all at once; a great, grinding beast of ice inching down a valley, chewing up mountains like so much tobacco and spitting out rocks bigger than your neighbor’s barn. 

Folks tell you they’re slow, and indeed, they are. But consider this: they’ve been at it for centuries, maybe millennia, a relentless push against the land, patient as a widow waiting for her inheritance. And talk about a sculptor! This glacier’s got no chisel but it can carve out valleys deeper than a preacher’s guilt, leaving behind lakes that shimmer like a misplaced piece of heaven. 

Then there's the spectacle of it all. A mountain of ice, shimmering blue in places, cracked and groaning like an old man getting out of bed. You can see layers in it, like rings on a tree, each a year gone by. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll witness a calving, when a chunk the size of a church breaks off and crashes into the sea with a roar that’d make a steamboat captain envious. It's a humbling sight, makes you realize that you and your troubles are about as significant as a dust mote in a hurricane. And let me tell you, after staring at one of these icy behemoths, you start to appreciate a warm fire and a good cup of coffee like never before. It makes you wonder if this ice is truly a threat or a gift, maybe both, a giant reminding us of nature's power, and our place within it.
