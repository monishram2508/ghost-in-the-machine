Carson City, bless its heart, is a curious little specimen of a town, clinging to the side of the Sierra Nevada like a burr on a mule's tail. It fancies itself a metropolis, no doubt, seeing as it lords over the rest of the dusty Nevada territory as its capital, but bless you if you find more than a handful of souls worth talking to, and fewer still who ain't got a silver fever simmering in their blood. Why, I reckon you could shoot a cannon down Main Street on a Tuesday afternoon and only risk ruffling the feathers of a stray chicken or startling a politician napping in his office, dreaming of mining claims and railway contracts.

The air, though, is something else. Clear as a bell, they say, and I suppose it is, unless the wind's kicked up some dust from the surrounding hills, turning the whole blamed landscape into a sepia photograph. You can see the mountains rising up around you like granite giants, all jagged and forbidding. Gives a fella a sense of his own insignificance, it does. Which is probably good for some of these politicians; might knock some of the hot air out of 'em.

As for entertainment, well, unless you count watching the tumbleweeds dance a jig across the desert floor, or observing the various saloons engage in a nightly contest of who can play the most out-of-tune piano the loudest, you’re better off bringing your own amusement. There's the legislature, of course, a grand circus of bloviating orators and backroom deals, but attending those is akin to watching paint dry, only less predictable. But don't let my good-natured ribbing sour you on the place entirely. It's got a certain...charm, I suppose. The kind of charm you find in a mangy dog with a good heart. It's got grit, Carson City. It’s stubborn. And in a land full of fly-by-night schemes and boom-and-bust towns, that’s worth something, ain't it?
