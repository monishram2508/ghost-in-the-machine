Genoa, bless its cobblestoned heart, is a city that looks like it was assembled by a committee of drunken pirates and Renaissance artists, all arguing fiercely over the blueprints. One suspects that when the plans called for a straight road, someone cleverly suggested running it uphill at a forty-degree angle, just to test the mettle of the poor mules and sedan chair carriers. And the buildings, oh, the buildings! They lean against one another like gossiping old women, whispering secrets of forgotten doges and perilous sea voyages. You see grand palaces, adorned with more marble than a Roman emperor's bathtub, cheek by jowl with tenements that look like they’ve been patched together with seaweed and hope. It's a bewildering jumble, a delightful mess, and one feels immediately that any attempt to impose order upon it would be akin to trying to teach a cat to play the harpsichord.

Now, I’ve heard tell that Genoa boasts of having more churches than taverns, a claim I find highly suspect, even on a Sunday morning. For I’ve seen the Genovese, a shrewd and sea-hardened lot, and I wager they know a good bottle of wine from a communion wafer any day of the week. The port, naturally, is the heart of the matter, throbbing with the pulse of commerce and the cries of gulls. Here one finds sailors of every stripe, speaking languages that would make a tower of Babel seem like a quiet chat. There's the scent of salt air, tar, and something vaguely fishy that lingers in the nostrils for days, a potent reminder that you're standing on the edge of the world, or at least, the edge of Italy as far as a ship can carry you. And if one ventures into the back alleys, away from the glittering facades, one discovers a labyrinth of shadows and secrets, a place where fortunes are made and lost, and where the past is as thick and clinging as the sea fog that rolls in off the Mediterranean. It’s a city that demands to be explored, not with a guidebook and a starched collar, but with a curious eye and a sturdy pair of boots, and perhaps a flask of something strong, just in case you get lost, or stumble upon a particularly verbose pirate reminiscing about the good old days.
