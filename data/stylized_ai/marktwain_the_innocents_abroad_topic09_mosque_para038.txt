Now, concerning this edifice they call a mosque, it’s quite a sight, mind you, though not perhaps in the way your average gilded palace might be. No, sir, the beauty here resides in something a bit more… earnest. They say it’s a house for God, which is a notion that always strikes me as a tad presumptuous. Imagine, claiming to own a building fit for the Almighty! Still, I suppose if one's going to build Him a home, you wouldn't want to skimp. These mosques, they come in all shapes and sizes, though usually adorned with these pointy towers, minarets they call 'em, poking the heavens like accusatory fingers. One can almost hear them whispering, "Are you up there, or what?"

Inside, it's usually rather bare, not like those cathedrals back in Europe with saints staring down from every nook and cranny. Just carpets – oh, glorious carpets, intricate as a spider's web after a particularly ambitious night – and a niche pointing towards Mecca, where they believe the whole shebang started. It's quite egalitarian, the whole business; rich and poor, all kneeling side-by-side, bumping shoulders like sardines in a can, muttering prayers in a language most of 'em probably only half understand. And the sermon! Bless their hearts, the preachers can go on for an eternity, their voices echoing off the bare walls like a lost soul looking for its way home. Sometimes I suspect they're just trying to outlast the heat, hoping everyone will be too drowsy to notice the loopholes in their logic. And the ablutions! Before they even step foot in the sacred space, they must wash, and wash thoroughly, their hands, faces, even their feet, as if trying to scrub away all the earthly sins accumulated since breakfast. Makes you wonder what they get up to before prayers, don’t it? But, all in all, it's a peaceful place, a bit like a giant communal sigh in the middle of a bustling world. Though I still think a good rocking chair and a strong cup of coffee would serve the purpose just as well, and with considerably less water.
