Chamonix, ah, Chamonix! They call it the "Mecca of Alpinism," which sounds rather grand, I suppose, like a holy city perched precariously on the roof of the world. And perched it certainly is, tucked into a valley like a lost franc note between the pages of a colossal geological ledger. The mountains, you understand, are not merely tall; they are aggressively, almost theatrically tall, jabbing heavenward with the kind of presumptuousness that would make a steeple blush. Mont Blanc, of course, lords it over the whole affair, looking down upon the diminutive humans scurrying below like so many ants upon a particularly wrinkled tablecloth.

I observed, with no small amusement, the preparations of these aspiring conquerors of the peak. Crampons gleaming like polished wickedness, ice axes sharpened to a murderous gleam, ropes coiled like captive pythons – enough gear to equip a small army. One can't help but wonder, does all this paraphernalia truly make one safer, or merely more confident in one's impending doom? I suspect the latter, for the mountains are notoriously indifferent to human ambition. They have seen emperors rise and fall, and I daresay a few over-equipped alpinists are unlikely to impress them much.

The town itself, dear me, is a curious jumble of rustic charm and blatant commercialism. Chalets, with their charming flower boxes overflowing with petunias in colors so vibrant they almost sing, stand cheek-by-jowl with shops selling overpriced souvenirs and gear that likely hasn't seen a mountain in its life. The air is thick with the scent of melted cheese and impending adventure, a combination that is either intoxicating or nauseating, depending on one's constitution (and possibly one's proximity to a fondue pot). The people, too, are a study in contrasts: grizzled veterans with faces etched by wind and weather mingle with rosy-cheeked tourists, each looking equally convinced that they are experiencing something profoundly important. It's all quite a spectacle, really, a grand human drama played out against the backdrop of geological indifference. A comedy, perhaps, though with a tinge of tragedy clinging to its snowy peaks.
