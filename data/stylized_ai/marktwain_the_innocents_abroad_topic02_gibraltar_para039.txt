Gibraltar, bless its heart, is a sight to behold, though one might argue a sight best beheld from a respectable distance, perhaps across the bay in Spain, where the wine is cheaper and the conversation, dare I say, a tad less British. For there she sits, this "Rock" as they so fondly call her, jutting out of the Mediterranean like a granite toothache. Imagine, if you will, a lion couchant, turned to stone mid-yawn, and you're halfway there. The other half requires a hefty dose of imagination indeed, for you must then envision this stone beast utterly crammed with the detritus of empire: cannons that haven't fired in anger since the Duke of Wellington was in short trousers, tunnels enough to shame a rabbit warren, and more red telephone boxes per square mile than seems strictly necessary, even allowing for the British propensity to queue for everything, including the apocalypse. And the monkeys! Ah, the Barbary apes, a scruffy, flea-ridden band of brigands who’ve clearly read Darwin and decided that the next step in evolution is to perfect the art of petty larceny. They’ll snatch your sandwiches, your sunglasses, even, I suspect, your dignity if you’re not careful. One fellow, a rather portly gent in a Panama hat, had his toupee lifted clean off his head by a particularly audacious simian, leaving him looking rather like a boiled egg surprised by its own nudity. He didn’t see the humor, mind you, but I confess I choked back a chuckle behind my handkerchief. The entire place, you see, feels like a slightly faded theatrical production, perpetually stuck in the late 19th century, where the main actors are perpetually arguing about whether to serve tea or sherry, and the stagehands are secretly smuggling cigarettes from Tangier. It's a charming absurdity, a living museum piece, albeit one that charges you an exorbitant entry fee and tries to sell you tax-free perfume at every turn. Still, you can't help but admire the tenacity, the sheer doggedness of the place. Gibraltar, it seems, is determined to remain Gibraltar, come what may, even if it means perpetually wearing a stiff upper lip and occasionally having its lunch stolen by a monkey.
