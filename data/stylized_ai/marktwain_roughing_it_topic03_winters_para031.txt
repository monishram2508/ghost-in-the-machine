Now, about winter in those parts – Lord, what a spectacle of discomfort and endurance! You hear tell of fellas in the East, wrapped up like mummies in furs, complaining about a "nip" in the air. Why, bless their cotton socks! That's just a summer breeze compared to the full-throated howl of a Nevada winter. We had winds that could peel paint off a barn, if we’d had barns worth painting, that is. Mostly, it was just rickety shacks and delusions of grandeur. The mercury? Why, it’d drop faster than a gambler's luck in a saloon brawl. We used to say it went so low it tickled the Devil's toes down in the hot place.

And the snow? Not that fluffy, picturesque nonsense you read about in them dime novels. No, sir. This was the kind that came down in thick, wet clumps, like a celestial dandruff storm. It piled up higher than a preacher's promises, burying everything under a blanket of white misery. Getting around was like wading through molasses mixed with broken glass. More than one feller lost a boot, a toe, or even his whole ambition in those drifts. The jackrabbits, usually so skittish, got so desperate they’d come right up to the door, practically begging for a scrap of grub. Which they weren’t getting, mind you, 'cause we were just as hungry as they were, only we had a more refined way of expressing it. Speaking of grub, finding enough firewood to keep a decent fire going was a quest worthy of King Arthur himself. You’d chop and you’d saw until your muscles screamed for mercy, and still the damn thing wouldn't burn right, just sit there smoldering and teasing you with the promise of warmth. All in all, winter out West was a character-building exercise, provided you survived it, which, come to think of it, wasn’t always a certainty.
