Now, Morgan, that specimen was a caution, a regular fire-alarm in pants, you might say. He drifted into Virginia City like a tumbleweed with a debt attached, claiming to be a “purveyor of fine entertainments and elevated thought,” which, translated from the fancy talk, meant he was a failed actor with a trunk full of moth-eaten costumes and a mouth full of schemes. He had the face of a reformed pickpocket, all angles and twitchy eyebrows, and a voice that sounded like gravel gargling with whiskey. Said he’d played Hamlet, though I reckon he’d be more convincing as the gravedigger, considering the way he carried himself – all slump and existential dread. He tried to put on a show at the Gaiety Saloon, mind you, billing it as a “Dramatic Rendition of the Bard’s Most Tragic Musings.” Problem was, the only tragedy the audience cared about was the price of whiskey and whether the faro dealer was cheating. Morgan started off alright, flailing around with a skull he probably borrowed from the undertaker, spouting Shakespeare like a broken water pump. But then a drunken miner, convinced he was being insulted by all the high-falutin' words, started throwing rotten tomatoes. The show dissolved faster than a snowbank in July. Poor Morgan, covered in pulped fruit, looked more tragic than any Hamlet ever could. He tried to salvage the evening by reciting poetry for spare change outside the saloon, but even the stray dogs gave him a wide berth. Last I saw of him, he was heading east on a swaybacked mule, promising to bring “culture and enlightenment” to the unsuspecting citizens of Denver. Lord help them, I say. He'd probably end up selling patent medicine and calling it a dramatic elixir. The world, it seems, is always ripe for a good huckster, even one dressed in tights and smelling of overripe tomatoes.
