Morgan, now there was a specimen fit for a museum, provided one could figure out where to put him. He hailed from, well, somewhere east of here, a land where they pronounce "cow" as something resembling a strangled cat, and seem to believe sunshine is a personal affront. Claimed he was a prospector, Morgan did, but I suspicioned he'd never seen the business end of a pickaxe, less he was using it to stir his coffee, which, mind you, he insisted on brewing with ditch water and a pinch of something he called "vitalizing herbs" that smelled suspiciously like horse liniment. He had a face that looked like it had lost a fight with a badger, all scarred and crinkled, and a voice like rusty hinges groaning under the weight of years. Said he was looking for the Mother Lode, the Big Bonanza, the one that'd make a man richer than sin and twice as miserable. Always muttering about "ancient maps" and "lost civilizations," things he'd probably found scribbled on the back of a bar napkin after a particularly rough night at the saloon. He was about as reliable as a politician's promise, and twice as likely to disappear when the bill came. Yet, there was something strangely endearing about the fella, like a mangy dog that follows you home and keeps trying to lick your boots. I reckon he believed in something, even if it was just the bottom of a bottle or the gleam of fool's gold. Spent more time talking than digging, Morgan did, but Lord, could he spin a yarn. You'd swear he'd fought dragons and seduced queens, all before breakfast. Likely, the most exciting thing he'd ever done was cheat at a game of checkers, but a man can dream, can't he? And Morgan, bless his addled heart, dreamed big. Just hoped his dreams didn't involve borrowing any more of my bacon.
