Brigham, now there was a character the likes of which you wouldn't stumble upon twice in a lifetime, not even if you was deliberately searchin’ with a bloodhound and a lantern in broad daylight. A man built like a Roman column, solid and imposin’, yet possessed of a twinkle in his eye that suggested he knew somethin' the rest of us poor fools didn’t – namely, the location of the celestial key rack and a direct line to the Almighty’s ear. He ruled that Salt Lake settlement with the same iron grip he used to yank a stubborn radish from the earth. And let me tell you, that soil out there was stubborn enough to argue the point with a buzzsaw.

He held court like some latter-day Caesar, only instead of gladiators and lions, he had sermons and tithing. The man could preach for three hours straight and keep a congregation glued to their pews, a feat considerin’ the pews was harder than a banker’s heart. He had a way of mixin' scripture with plain common sense that even a mule could comprehend, though I suspect some o’ them mule-headed Saints needed it explained twice. He was always quotin' the good book, but he never let it interfere with a shrewd land deal or a well-placed dam. He was practical, Brigham was, right down to the soles of his boots, even if his notions about matrimony did lean a bit towards the... let's just say "expansive" side. A man with that many wives had to have a talent for organization, a memory like an elephant, and the diplomatic skill of a Secretary of State negotiatin' with a room full of rattlesnakes. Why, some folks claimed he knew each of their names and birthdays! Of course, there were whisperings and backbiting, as always accompanies power and prosperity, but nobody ever dared say a word to Brigham’s face, not if they valued the air in their lungs. He had a certain look, a glint in his eye that could freeze hell over, that let you know exactly where you stood, and precisely how far you could push things before you were likely to find yourself pushing up daisies instead.
