Zermatt, you say? A village clinging to the foot of the Matterhorn like a lovesick swain to a particularly stubborn maiden. One might think, given its reputation as a mountain mecca, that the air would be thick with solemn alpinists, each with a beard longer than your average dachshund and a vocabulary limited to grunts and pronouncements on the perils of crevasses. And truth be told, there are specimens of that breed aplenty. But Zermatt, bless its heart, is also a stage for the human comedy in all its gaudy glory. You'll find dandies in fur coats, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they're practically dressed as bears amidst an already mountainous landscape. Their wives, of course, draped in jewels that could shame a chandelier, tottering on heels quite unfit for the cobblestones that pave the village.

And the tourists! My heavens, the tourists! They arrive in droves, carting cameras the size of small cannons, determined to capture the perfect angle of the Matterhorn. They pose with it, they pose in front of it, they practically try to swallow it whole with their lenses. One imagines the Matterhorn, if it possessed sentience, would grow quite weary of these ceaseless photographic assaults. But then, what is a mountain to do? It can scarcely pack its bags and move to a less scrutinized locale.

But it's the absence of the horseless carriage that truly sets Zermatt apart. A sanctuary from the infernal combustion engine! One is transported hither and yon by electric buggies, which glide through the narrow streets with a gentle hum. It's a charming anachronism, this reliance on electricity, a sort of backward-looking futurism that I find quite disarming. It’s as if the villagers have decided that while the rest of the world is determined to destroy itself with progress, they shall cling to a quieter, saner, and infinitely more picturesque way of life, thank you very much. And one can scarcely blame them, can one? For even a jaded traveler such as myself must confess, Zermatt has a certain… charm. A charm that clings to the air like the scent of woodsmoke and freshly baked bread. And even if the Matterhorn is but a backdrop for endless tourist photographs, it is, undeniably, a magnificent backdrop. A stage for the grand, and often ludicrous, drama of human existence.
