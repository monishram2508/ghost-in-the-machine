The portier, bless its tasseled heart, is a creature of profound ambivalence, perched as it is twixt the hall and the parlor like a plump pigeon on a weather vane, undecided whether to fly in or fly out. Now, folks will tell you it’s there to keep the drafts at bay, to whisper “hush” to the clamorous winter winds, and prevent the parlor from becoming a Siberian outpost. And that’s a noble purpose, indeed, worthy of a medal, perhaps even a small, insignificant statue erected in the dusty corner of the attic. But I suspect its true calling lies in the realm of intrigue. It’s a magnificent blabbermouth, a silent confidante privy to every hushed conversation, every stolen kiss, every nervous cough preceding a proposal. Oh, the secrets it could tell, if only it wasn’t so darn busy being a drape!

I’ve often watched it, you see, this ponderous curtain, swaying ever so slightly as if possessed by a mischievous spirit. One suspects it’s eavesdropping with the best of ‘em, absorbing the gossip like a thirsty sponge. And don’t tell me it doesn’t judge. Observe how it droops just a tad more when ol’ Mr. Higgins stumbles past, reeking of rotgut and broken promises. And how it seems to perk up, like a spinster spotting a handsome parson, when young Miss Abigail, all blushing cheeks and hopeful glances, sails through on the arm of that charlatan from the city. Yes, the portier sees all, knows all, and likely judges us all with the silent, disdainful air of a well-worn Persian rug. It’s a silent observer, a fabric witness to the human comedy, and I wouldn’t be surprised to find, one of these days, that it’s started keeping a diary, written in thread and embroidered with the scandalous secrets of the household. Mark my words, that portier's got more stories than a seasoned traveler, and more dirt than a gravedigger’s shovel.
