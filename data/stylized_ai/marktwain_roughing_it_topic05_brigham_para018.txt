Brigham, that prophet of the beehive, you know. A man built like a bull and twice as stubborn, which is saying something, considering the general cussedness of your average bull. I tell you what, watching him lead those Saints across the plains was a sight, a regular slow-motion Exodus performed by a cast of characters straight out of a backwoods circus. There they were, wagons creaking, oxen groaning, babies squalling, all headed for that promised land, a place where the desert blooms, supposedly, and the grasshopper don't eat your crop. It was a gamble, no doubt, but Brigham, he was a gambler, all right. He bet his life, and a good many others, on that faith of his, and blame if he didn't mostly win.

Now, some folks say he was a despot, a tyrannical old coot with more wives than sense. And maybe there’s some truth to that. But I say, look at the size of Salt Lake City, blooming like a rose from a patch of sagebrush. That didn’t happen by accident. That took organization, discipline, and a healthy dose of chicanery. And Brigham, he had all three in spades. He wrangled those Saints like a cowboy wrangles cattle, and he weren’t afraid to crack the whip now and then. He built canals, planted crops, and established a theocracy so tight you couldn't slip a needle between the doctrine and the day-to-day living. He was a builder, a lawgiver, a preacher, and a bit of a scoundrel, all rolled into one impressive, if somewhat alarming, package. And though I wouldn’t want to be on his bad side, I reckon the West wouldn’t be quite the same without him. He left a mark, that Brigham, a big, peculiar, and indelible mark, and it’ll be a long day in the hereafter before they forget the man who made the desert yield.
