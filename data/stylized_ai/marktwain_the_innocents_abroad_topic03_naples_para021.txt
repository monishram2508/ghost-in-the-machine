Naples, ah, Naples! A city so densely packed with humanity it’s a wonder the whole place don’t sink right into the Bay. And what a bay it is, mind you, a sparkling sapphire framed by Vesuvius, that old humbug of a volcano just waiting, I suspect, for the opportune moment to fling another load of ash and brimstone upon the unsuspecting Neapolitans. One gets the distinct impression that life in Naples is a perpetual game of chicken with Mother Nature herself.

The streets, well, the streets are a study in organized chaos, a symphony of shouting vendors, sputtering Vespas, and determined pedestrians who seem to believe that the sidewalk is merely a decorative suggestion. One sees more near-death experiences in an hour in Naples than one might witness in a lifetime in, say, Hartford, Connecticut. The Neapolitans, however, appear utterly unfazed, possessing a certain swagger that suggests they hold a private wager with the grim reaper, and are quite confident of winning.

And the food! Bless my stars, the food! Why, a man could subsist entirely on pizza and espresso for a year and never once tire of it. They say the secret to Neapolitan pizza is the water, drawn straight from the bowels of Vesuvius, or some such nonsense. But I wager the real secret is the sheer, unadulterated joy with which the Neapolitans approach their culinary endeavors. They eat with gusto, they talk with gusto, they live with gusto, and they’d sooner throttle you than let you take the last bite of their sfogliatella.

As for the churches, Lord have mercy, they're like gilded birdcages, crammed with enough saints and cherubs to populate a small heaven. And the laundry, strung out across the narrowest of streets, flapping in the breeze like so many triumphant flags! Yes, Naples is a city of contradictions, a city of beauty and squalor, of saints and sinners, a city where life is lived at full throttle, and where even the dust motes seem to possess a certain theatrical flair. It's a place to be experienced, not explained, lest you find yourself tangled in a web of contradictions and complexities that would make even the most seasoned philosopher throw up his hands in despair.
