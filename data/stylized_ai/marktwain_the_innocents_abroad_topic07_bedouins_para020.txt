Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked hides, are a curious lot indeed. You find them gallivanting about the Arabian deserts, a place so inhospitable it makes Nevada look like a blooming garden party. They’re always on the move, these nomadic chaps, drifting like tumbleweeds with a peculiar stubbornness. Imagine, if you will, strapping all your worldly belongings onto a camel – a beast of burden with the disposition of a disgruntled tax collector – and then setting off into a landscape that’s mostly sand, sand, and more sand, occasionally punctuated by a rock or two just to break the monotony. Why, a sane man would think twice before even considering such a venture, but not your Bedouin. Oh no, they seem to thrive on it.

They are a remarkably self-sufficient bunch, capable of squeezing water from stones, metaphorically speaking, of course, though I wouldn’t put it past them to find a literal method if sufficiently challenged. Their tents, fashioned from goat hair, are a marvel of minimalist architecture. They offer protection, of sorts, from the scorching sun and the biting desert winds, though I suspect a well-placed parasol and a stiff drink would offer superior comfort. Their clothing is equally practical: loose-fitting robes that billow in the wind, making them look for all the world like ghostly apparitions flitting across the dunes. And their hospitality! Why, they’ll offer you dates and strong coffee, even if they suspect you’re a carpetbagging scoundrel trying to swindle them out of their camels. Of course, that hospitality comes with certain expectations, namely, that you don’t insult their ancestors, their camels, or their coffee, preferably in that order. And heaven help you if you try to haggle too aggressively over the price of a rug. They’re shrewd traders, these Bedouins, sharper than a tack and twice as rusty. One suspects they've been driving a hard bargain since the dawn of time, one camel trade at a time. All in all, a peculiar but fascinating people, these Bedouins. One wonders if they realize how much simpler life would be if they just settled down and invested in a decent air conditioner. But then again, progress, like a good mirage, is often more alluring than it is practical.
