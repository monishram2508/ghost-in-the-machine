Now, about these winters out West, folks back East imagine they're all romanticized buffalo hunts and cozy nights by the fire, swigging whiskey like it's mother's milk. Hogwash, I say! The truth is, winter arrives like a debt collector with a frozen mustache – unwelcome and insistent. First comes the snow, of course, a grand white lie that covers up all the ugliness of the land like a debutante hiding a black eye with powder. It looks pretty enough for a spell, all sparkling and pristine, until you realize that every pretty snowflake is a tiny, frozen hammer, beating down on your poor, defenseless cabin. Then comes the wind, a banshee howling through the canyons, sounding for all the world like a coyote choir practicing for a funeral. You'd swear it's trying to rip the very boards off your walls, and sometimes, bless its persistent heart, it nearly succeeds.

And the cold? Oh, the cold is a marvel of nature’s cruelty. It ain’t just cold, it's bone-rattling, marrow-freezing, dog-curling-up-and-begging-for-mercy cold. You could hang a wet shirt outside and it'd be stiff as a politician’s promise in ten minutes flat. Then there's the fuel problem. You spend half your daylight hours chopping wood, stacking it, hauling it, and then you burn through it faster than a gambler loses his shirt. And mind you, you're doing all this while wearing so many layers of wool you can barely bend over to scratch your nose. Food becomes a game of survival, where every frozen turnip and petrified potato is a prize worth fighting a grizzly bear for. Come spring, you're leaner, meaner, and probably smelling faintly of woodsmoke, but bless your heart you’re alive to tell the tale, and probably embroider it with a little bit of storytelling truth too.
