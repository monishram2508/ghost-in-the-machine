Chamonix, you say? Well, I reckon I've seen towns prettier, and I've certainly seen towns less infested with the sort of tourist who thinks climbing a mountain requires nothing more than a fancy new goose-down coat and a profound ignorance of the French language. It's a comical sight, I tell you, these rosy-cheeked adventurers, panting and puffing their way up those slopes, their guides looking as though they've aged ten years for every one they've dragged these pilgrims up. The village itself is a hodgepodge of half-timbered chalets and modern monstrosities, a testament to progress, I suppose, though I can't quite call it *improvement*. The air is sharp, mind you, and filled with the clatter of mountaineering equipment and the shouts of vendors hawking everything from overpriced cheese to photographs of your harrowing ascent, even if your ascent only took you as far as the pastry shop on the corner. 

And the mountains! Ah, the mountains. Mont Blanc looms over the whole affair like a stern schoolmaster, watching over its charges with a silent, glacial judgment. It's a breathtaking spectacle, certainly, enough to inspire even the most cynical soul to consider, for a fleeting moment, the insignificance of human endeavor. Then you remember you have to pay an exorbitant fee to ride the gondola halfway up, and the moment passes. But still, there's a certain romance to the place, a whiff of adventure that hangs in the air like the scent of pine needles and fear. It's a good place to watch people make fools of themselves, or maybe, just maybe, do something genuinely remarkable. One might even be tempted to join them, provided, of course, one has packed a sufficient supply of nerve, cheese, and an extra pair of wool socks. For, as they say in these parts, "bon courage," which, I suspect, loosely translates to "good luck, you'll need it."
