Baden-Baden, they call it. Baden squared, as if one Baden weren't enough to thoroughly soak a body in its mineral waters and utterly drain a man's pocketbook. A charming little humbug it is, nestled prettily between the hills like a diamond dropped in a velvet pouch, only this diamond is cutting into the pouch quite something fierce. One can scarcely walk a block without tripping over a Grand Duke or Countess, each puffing themselves up like prize pigeons, all come to partake in the supposed cure for what ails 'em. And what ails 'em, mostly, appears to be an inconvenient surplus of money. They gather at the Trinkhalle, these afflicted souls, sipping their "curative" waters which smell vaguely of rotten eggs and taste precisely like a stagnant pond visited by a particularly uncouth frog. Yet, they swear by it. Claim it revitalizes the spirit, soothes the nerves. I reckon what soothes the nerves is the anticipation of a hefty win at the casino, which is, of course, the true heart and soul of Baden. That's where the real healing occurs, you see. A sudden influx of funds can cure a man of almost any ailment, even good sense. The gardens, though, they are a sight. Manicured within an inch of their lives, so perfectly arranged as to feel almost artificial. One half expects to find clockwork butterflies flitting amongst the roses. And the ladies! Heavens to Betsy, the ladies! Dressed to kill, and carrying enough diamonds to single-handedly prop up the Antwerp market. They parade about, their bonnets resembling overflowing fruit baskets, whispering scandalous nothings behind their delicate fans. It's all a grand show, you see, a carefully orchestrated charade designed to separate the gullible from their hard-earned (or, more likely, inherited) funds. And the air is thick with it, this heady mixture of perfume, intrigue, and the faint sulfurous aroma of a cure that smells suspiciously like a con. One might just as well take their malady to the nearest ditch and be done with it. At least the ditch wouldn't charge you a king's ransom for the privilege.
