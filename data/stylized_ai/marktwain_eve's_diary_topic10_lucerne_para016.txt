Well, bless my stars, if it wasn't Lucerne sittin' there so smug and pretty, all framed by them Alps like a fancy chromolithograph meant to entice pilgrims and pocketbooks both. A body'd think the Lord Almighty took a particular shine to the place, what with that turquoise lake sparklin' brighter than a freshly polished dime and Mount Pilatus lookin' down like a disapprovin' auntie. I reckon it's a mite too picturesque to be entirely honest, like them society dames who spend half the day primpin' before they condescend to be seen.

I fair traipsed all over, mind you, dodgin’ pigeons fattier than any goose I've ever laid eyes on, and marvelin' at the Chapel Bridge, which, I swear, has had more coats of paint than Noah's Ark. Them painted panels inside, they're supposed to be tellin' stories, but half the time they looked to me like somebody's poorly executed fever dream. And the Lion Monument? A right pitiful spectacle, carved out of the rock like a hound dog dreamin' of a lost bone. Still, folks stand around gawkin', handkerchiefs dabbin' at their eyes, pretendin' it's a tragedy of profound importance. I suspect half of 'em are just tryin' to look intelligent for their travel companions.

The Swiss, bless their industrious little hearts, keep everything squeaky clean and runnin' on time. It's admirable, I suppose, but leaves you feelin' like you ought to be polishing your shoes and payin' off your debts just for bein' in the vicinity. And the prices? Lord have mercy, they'll fleece you quicker than a carnival hustler. You’d think they were sellin’ solidified sunshine, the way they carry on. But even with the inflated cost of a cup of coffee and the pervasive feeling that you ought to be wearin' a cravat and carrying a walking stick, Lucerne does have a certain charm. It’s like a well-behaved child, all dressed up in its Sunday best, just beggin' to be admired. And who am I to deny it? Especially when there's a chocolate shop on every corner. Now, that's something even a cynic like myself can get behind.
