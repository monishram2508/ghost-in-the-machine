Now, about these mosques, these imposing structures that dot the landscape like giant, ornate sugar lumps—well, I've seen a fair share of 'em, mind you. Cairo's got more than a body's got bones, I reckon, each one vying for your attention with minarets that stick up in the air like so many pious fingers wagging at the heavens. They are, without a doubt, sights to behold, even if you're not entirely sure what all the fuss is about inside. You see these fellas, bless their cotton socks, streaming in and out at all hours, muttering prayers and doffing their shoes with the kind of reverence I usually reserve for a cold glass of lemonade on a sweltering day. 

The architecture itself is a thing of wonderment, you see these domes, swelling like a sultan's belly after a particularly good feast, and walls covered in intricate patterns that would make a mathematician weep with joy or sheer frustration, depending on his temperament. And the calligraphy! Why, it's enough to give a fellow writer the itch to give up penning plain English and take up swirling Arabic. Though, I fear my attempts would end up looking more like a cat had a brawl with a spilled ink bottle.

Inside, well, that's a different kettle of fish altogether. It's hushed, peaceful as a sleeping hound, even with all those souls shuffling about. You feel as if you ought to whisper, even if you haven't the foggiest notion what you'd whisper about. I've seen tourists blunder in, all wide-eyed and snapping pictures, looking like they've just stumbled into a secret society. Which, perhaps they have, in a manner of speaking. Though, I’ve always suspected that the Almighty, whatever His name may be, has a soft spot for a good tourist, just so long as they remember to take their shoes off at the door. After all, who's going to pay for the collection plate if it isn't the blundering tourist? Just a thought, mind you, a thought that came to me like a bolt of lightning, while sitting beneath the grandness of it all.
