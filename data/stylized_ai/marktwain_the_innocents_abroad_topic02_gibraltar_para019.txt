Now, Gibraltar. Ah, Gibraltar! A veritable wart upon the nose of Spain, thrust pugnaciously towards Africa like a stubborn Englishman determined to have the last word. One might call it a rock, and one would be, strictly speaking, correct, though it's a rock that has seen more gunpowder and smelled more treachery than your average geologist might care to contemplate. I found it a most peculiar place, indeed. The British, bless their imperial hearts, cling to it with the tenacity of a tick upon a dog, insisting upon its Britishness even as the very apes upon the hillside seem to sneer in a distinctly Iberian fashion. These apes, the Barbary macaques, are, I'm told, a crucial part of the garrison's success, their presence supposedly intertwined with the island's continued British rule. Should they depart, the Union Jack, it is said, shall follow. A curious strategy, one must admit, to entrust the fate of an empire to a band of hairy, kleptomaniacal primates with a penchant for stealing ladies' hats and the occasional sandwich.

The town itself is a hodgepodge, a delightful jumble of red telephone boxes and duty-free shops, where one can purchase a bottle of Scotch whiskey for less than the price of a decent cigar back in San Francisco. The architecture seems caught in a time warp, a collision of Victorian grandeur and sun-baked Moorish influence, as if a regiment of redcoats had decided to build a holiday home in the Alhambra after a particularly rowdy cricket match. And the language! A Babel of tongues, English clipped and proper mingling with the lilting Spanish of the locals, all seasoned with a healthy dose of sailor’s slang and the occasional Italian exclamation. One feels as though one could understand everything and nothing at the same time, a most bewildering, yet strangely compelling, experience. Yes, Gibraltar, a rock, a fortress, a haven for tax evasion, and home to the cheekiest monkeys I have ever encountered. A place to see, certainly, if only to marvel at the sheer audacity of it all.
