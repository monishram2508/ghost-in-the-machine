Now, Higbie was a character fit to stuff a museum, a specimen so particular, you couldn’t hardly duplicate him if you tried with a year’s worth of lightning and a barrel of patent medicine. He was a Cornishman by birth, I reckon, though you’d never know it, not from the accent he’d picked up knocking about the diggings. Said “by gosh” with the frequency of a hummingbird flaps its wings, and had an opinion on everything from the price of pork in Sacramento to the proper way to teach a jackass to sing. Claimed he'd been everywhere and seen everything, from the halls of Montezuma to the inside of a Chinaman’s opium den, though I suspect his travels extended as far as the nearest saloon and back again.

He was a walking encyclopedia of misinformation, that man. If you asked him the distance to the moon, he’d give you a figure so precise, down to the very inch, that it sounded convincing, until you remembered that the figure changed every blessed night. And he'd deliver it all with the solemnity of a preacher delivering a fire-and-brimstone sermon, never cracking a smile, even when the absurdity of it all was enough to make a coyote howl with laughter. He was always getting himself involved in some harebrained scheme or another, guaranteed to make him a millionaire overnight, schemes that usually involved prospecting for silver with a divining rod or breeding prize-winning watermelons in the middle of the desert.

Of course, these ventures always ended in a magnificent failure, leaving Higbie poorer than Job’s turkey and covered in more alkali dust than a politician's promises. But did he learn his lesson? Not a lick. He’d dust himself off, spit out a wad of tobacco juice, and launch into the next grand idea with the same unwavering enthusiasm. You had to admire the man's tenacity, even if his common sense was as scarce as hen's teeth. He was a fool, certainly, but a lovable one. A fool who provided more entertainment than a travelling circus, and whose tales, no matter how tall, were always worth the price of a whiskey. You'd swear half the things he claimed were pure invention, yet there he stood, large as life and twice as interesting, daring you to disbelieve him. And in the end, you mostly did. Or at least, you wanted to.
