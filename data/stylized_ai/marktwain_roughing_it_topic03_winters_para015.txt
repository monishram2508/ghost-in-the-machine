Winter, ah, that tyrannical old miser, he arrives each year with the predictable punctuality of a bill collector, and just as welcome too. He's got a nasty habit of pinching the sunlight right out of the day, leaving you stumbling about in the gloom like a blindfolded mule in a molasses factory. And the wind? Don't even get me started on the wind! It howls like a banshee who's just discovered her stew is cold, and cuts through your coat like a hot knife through, well, soft butter, I suppose, though I haven’t encountered much of that commodity out here in these parts. More like a hot knife through frozen turnips, which is about the only edible thing that thrives during this infernal season. Now, I’ve seen winters back East, mind you, civilized winters with sleigh bells and hot toddies. But out here in the territories, winter is a different beast altogether. It's a scoundrel of a season, a brawling, back-alley bully that throws snowstorms at you with the force of a runaway stagecoach. Then there's the animals. Every critter with an ounce of sense has packed up shop and headed south, leaving behind only the mangy coyotes, who seem to thrive on misery, and the occasional prospector, even more mangy, who stubbornly believes he'll strike it rich before his fingers freeze solid. You'd think folks would learn after the first few years, but no sir. They're back again, shivering and hacking and dreaming of gold, God bless their stubborn, foolish hearts. And me? Well, I’m right there with them, huddled around a sputtering fire, cursing the cold, and secretly hoping the spring will hurry up and get here before I'm mistaken for a particularly unappetizing snowdrift.
