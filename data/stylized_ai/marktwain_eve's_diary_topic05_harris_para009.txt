Harris, now there's a specimen of humanity fit for observation, albeit from a safe and respectable distance, mind you. He fancies himself a man of affairs, does Harris, a pillar of society propped up by good intentions and a startling lack of practical application. Why, I recall the time he decided to take up beekeeping. Swore it was a lucrative venture, a chance to commune with nature and sweeten the world, one honey-glazed biscuit at a time. He purchased the finest hives, the most elaborate netting, and consulted with every beekeeper in a fifty-mile radius, absorbing their wisdom like a sponge. The problem, as it so often is with Harris, resided not in the planning, but in the execution. He proceeded to install the hives in his backyard, right under the bedroom window of Mrs. Higgins, the widow who's already fragile constitution couldn't endure a buzzing thought. Within a day, Mrs. Higgins was wielding a broom and yelling about swarms and stings and Harris' general disregard for the sanctity of a peaceful afternoon nap. The bees, for their part, seemed equally unimpressed with Harris's vision. They ignored his fancy sugar water, and instead decided to invade the neighbor’s prize-winning petunia patch. The whole affair ended with Harris donating the hives (and a substantial sum of money) to the local monastery and swearing off apiculture for good. He now dedicates his spare time to competitive croquet, which, while less hazardous to the neighborhood, provides ample opportunities for him to trip over his own feet and deliver lengthy explanations for his inevitable defeats. Yes, Harris is a character, a man whose enthusiasm often outpaces his competence, a living testament to the enduring comedy of human endeavor. You can't help but smile, even as you inwardly shudder at the thought of what he'll attempt next. It's guaranteed to be something grand, something ill-conceived, and utterly, hilariously, Harris.
