Now, Damascus, they say, is the oldest city in the world. I reckon that's a considerable claim, but I've seen enough “oldest” this and “most ancient” that on my travels to know it's usually just a fella trying to sell you something – preferably a carpet or a camel ride. Still, there's a certain undeniable air of antiquity hanging about the place, like mothballs in your grandmother's attic. You stroll through its winding streets, narrower than a miser's heart, and you half expect to bump into Noah himself, haggling over the price of dates. The houses lean in on each other, whispering secrets in Arabic, their balconies practically kissing across the lanes. I swear, if you dropped a hat in one of those alleys, it would take a week to find its way to the ground.

The air itself is a concoction of scents – jasmine and spices battling it out with the ever-present aroma of donkey. It's a potent brew, I tell you, enough to curl your mustache and make you forget your troubles, or at least forget why you came to Damascus in the first place. The people, bless their hearts, are a curious lot. They'll stare at you with an open curiosity that's either endearing or unnerving, depending on how you're feeling that day. They'll try to sell you everything from rusty daggers to suspiciously shiny jewelry, all the while swearing it’s the genuine article, crafted by the very hands of Saladin himself. Just nod politely, offer a ridiculously low price, and walk away slowly – that’s usually enough to ward them off, or at least bring the price down to something approaching sanity. And don't even get me started on the coffee. Black as sin, strong as a Turkish wrestler, and guaranteed to keep you awake for a week. Drink at your own risk, my friend, drink at your own risk. Damascus, you see, is not a place to be taken lightly. It's a city that grabs you by the lapels, spins you around, and leaves you blinking in the sunlight, wondering what in tarnation just happened. But I wouldn't have missed it for all the tea in China. No, sir, not for all the tea in China.
