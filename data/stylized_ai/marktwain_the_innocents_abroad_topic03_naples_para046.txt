Naples, ah, Naples! A city that looks, at first blush, like a beggar draped in the tattered finery of a king. You stroll down her streets, minding your pockets lest some nimble-fingered Neapolitan lighten your load, and you find yourself assaulted by a cacophony that would drive a lesser man mad. Donkey carts vie for space with motorcars that have evidently lost their mufflers and any sense of decorum. The air itself is thick with the scent of frying something, something vaguely familiar but distinctly…off. It hangs about you like a persistent suitor, until you find yourself yearning for the sterile, odorless air of a dentist's office. One might think the entire population lives outdoors, judging by the laundry strung between buildings like celebratory banners for a victory no one can quite recall. The women, bless their stout hearts, possess a certain…assertiveness. They'll haggle you down to the last lira for a trinket you don't need, and then glare at you as if *you've* robbed *them* of their inheritance. The men, meanwhile, loiter about with an air of indolence that suggests they've solved the riddle of life, which involves doing as little as possible. And yet, despite this apparent chaos and clamor, Naples possesses a charm, a devilish glint in its eye that is positively irresistible. It is a city where the beautiful and the grotesque mingle freely, where the sacred and the profane dance a merry jig, where you can eat a pizza so divine it will make you weep, and then trip over a heap of refuse on your way back to your lodgings. One can’t quite pin it down, this Naples magic, but it is there, shimmering beneath the grime like a pearl in a pigsty. A pigsty, mind you, with surprisingly excellent opera.
