Now, concerning these Mosques, these edifices that dot the landscape like so many carefully placed turbans, one can’t help but observe their peculiar character. They ain’t your run-of-the-mill steeple-sporting churches, no sir. They’re built with a kind of…well, a kind of *humility* that’s almost comical when you consider the lofty pronouncements often issuing forth from within. Domes bulge like ripe melons, begging to be tapped for sweetness (though I wouldn't recommend it; the Imams might take exception), and minarets, those skinny towers reaching for the heavens, stand like pious fellows stretching to catch a particularly juicy morsel of divine gossip.

I once saw a fellow, a tourist no doubt, attempt to photograph a particularly grand Mosque with a contraption that looked like a mule had sneezed and coughed up a camera. He fiddled and fussed, tilting this way and that, trying to get the angle just right. You’d think he was capturing the Second Coming, instead of a building made of bricks and mortar! Meanwhile, the faithful, dressed in their flowing robes, strolled past him with an air of serene indifference, as if to say, "Son, you can photograph the *outside* all you like, but you ain't gonna capture the *inside* with that gizmo."

And bless their hearts, they’re likely right. For these Mosques, they’re not just about the architecture, oh no. They’re about the whispers of prayer, the murmur of shared faith, the rustling of prayer beads like dried leaves in an autumn wind. They are places where a fellow can escape the clatter and clamor of the marketplace, the incessant bickering over prices and politics, and find a moment of quiet reflection. Though, mind you, I wouldn't expect too *much* quiet. After all, even the Almighty, I suspect, appreciates a good debate now and again, especially when it comes to figuring out who's gonna win the next camel race.
