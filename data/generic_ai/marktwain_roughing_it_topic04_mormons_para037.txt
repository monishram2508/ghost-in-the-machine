The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, arose from the religious experiences of Joseph Smith in the early 19th century. Smith claimed to have received divine revelations, including the translation of the Book of Mormon, which Mormons consider scripture alongside the Bible. This text narrates the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. Central to Mormon belief is the concept of a restored gospel, asserting that the original church established by Jesus Christ was lost and that God, through Joseph Smith, reestablished it with the proper authority and ordinances. These ordinances, such as baptism for the dead and temple sealings, are understood to have eternal significance, binding families together beyond mortal life. Mormon theology also encompasses a unique understanding of the Godhead, believing in three distinct beings – God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost – united in purpose. They emphasize the importance of personal revelation and continual spiritual growth.

Mormon culture is often characterized by a strong emphasis on family values, community involvement, and adherence to a strict code of conduct. Members are encouraged to abstain from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, and illicit drugs, following a health code known as the Word of Wisdom. Missionary service is a significant aspect of young adulthood for many Mormon men and women, dedicating 18 months to 2 years to proselyting and serving others. The church is organized hierarchically, with local congregations led by bishops, and higher levels of leadership overseeing larger geographical regions. The Church's headquarters are located in Salt Lake City, Utah, a place that became a refuge for early members fleeing persecution. Beyond religious practice, the Church is heavily involved in charitable work, humanitarian aid, and education, operating institutions like Brigham Young University. Although initially controversial due to practices like polygamy, which was discontinued in 1890, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown into a global faith with millions of members worldwide, striving to live according to what they believe is God's will.
