Now, Galilee, bless her heart, is a region that'll try the patience of a saint, though I doubt St. Peter would have complained much, seeing as how he hailed from her dusty parts. They call it the Galilee, see, as if there was only the one, and precious little distinction to be found twixt one scrubby hillside and another, save for the prickly pear cactus that seemed determined to colonize every available inch of land. I’d been told of its rustic charm, and let me tell you, rustic it is! Charming? Well, that depends on your definition of charm. If you find charm in rocks and thistles and the occasional goat with a suspicious glint in its eye, then by all means, you’ll find Galilee brimming with it.

The Sea of Galilee, though, that's where the real business is. They call it a sea, mind you, but it’s hardly bigger than a respectable puddle in a Missouri thunderstorm. Still, it's famous, on account of all the miraculous goings-on that occurred about its shores. Walking on water, feeding the five thousand with what amounted to a fisherman’s meager lunch – why, it's enough to make a fellow wonder if they weren't spiking the local wine with something a bit stronger than water. But I digress, a common malady amongst us traveling fellows. The towns dotted about it, like Tiberias and Capernaum, are places steeped in history. Though mostly what I found steeped was dust, the sort that clings to your clothes and settles in your teeth like a stubborn old debt collector. But for all its rough edges and sun-baked landscapes, the Galilee possesses a certain… well, let's just call it a *persistence*. It has seen empires rise and fall, prophets come and go, and yet it remains, stubborn as a mule and twice as picturesque. A land of contradictions, she is, that Galilee. Just the sort of place to make a fellow think hard about things, if he could only manage to think through the dust.
