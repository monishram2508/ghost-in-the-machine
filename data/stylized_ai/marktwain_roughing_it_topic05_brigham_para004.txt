Brigham, ah, Brigham Young! Now there was a fellow who could make a desert bloom, though I'm not entirely convinced it was with roses. More likely sagebrush and a healthy dose of unwavering faith, seasoned with a pinch of shrewd land speculation. He certainly had a head for figures, Brigham did. Why, managing all those wives alone was a feat of logistical genius, rivaled only by the time I tried to calculate the distance to the next saloon in Nevada using only a broken compass and a bottle of rye. Let me tell you, neither venture yielded perfectly accurate results, but both were adventures nonetheless.

He stood up to the government too, you know, which is always good for a chuckle, seeing as how most governments are just begging to be stood up to. It was a bit of a standoff, with troops marching toward Salt Lake City and Brigham puffing out his chest like a prairie chicken getting ready to impress the hens. Of course, he eventually figured out that bullets and bayonets ain't swayed much by righteous indignation, so he backed down a tad. Still, you got to admire a man who'll stare down Uncle Sam, even if he's secretly got a bag of escape routes planned in the basement.

Brigham was a practical man, you see. No time for flowery speeches or highfalutin' ideals when there was a whole territory to irrigate and convert. He built temples, established settlements, and generally kept his flock in line. Some folks might call him a tyrant, but I reckon he was just a shepherd with a mighty big crook. And, lord knows, sometimes you need a good crook to herd a flock, especially when that flock is made up of folks who've already packed up and crossed half the country chasing a dream, and are prone to wandering off chasing mirages. So there you have it: Brigham Young – part prophet, part politician, part real estate mogul, and all character. A curious fella all around, that one was.
