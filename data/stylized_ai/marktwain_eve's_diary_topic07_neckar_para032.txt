Well now, here's a river they call the Neckar, and I reckon it's a pretty enough thing in its own unassuming way. Not a Mississippi, mind you, none of that roiling, muddy grandeur. The Neckar's more like a well-behaved, though perhaps slightly long-winded, stream that's had a good upbringing. It meanders along, you see, through this German country, past castles perched on hills that look suspiciously like they were placed there precisely for the purpose of being picturesque, like ornaments on a particularly ambitious Christmas tree. One might be tempted to wax poetic about its "azure depths" or "emerald banks," but let's be honest, it's water, and the banks are mostly green. 

The real entertainment, as always, lies in the folks who inhabit its shores. These Germans, bless their punctual souls, they take this river quite seriously. You'll see them cycling alongside it with the determination of a hound after a rabbit, or paddling along in kayaks, looking ever so efficient and probably planning their next sausage-related feast. They’ve built towns alongside it, quaint affairs with half-timbered houses leaning in for a gossip, as if whispering secrets about who forgot to separate their recycling. And then there are the bridges, ah, the bridges! Each one more elaborate than the last, as if they were engaged in some grand, stone-cold competition to see who could build the most unnecessarily ornate crossing. One almost expects a panel of bridge judges to arrive any minute, clipboards in hand, awarding points for arch symmetry and gargoyle placement. And I’ll be darned if they aren’t usually crowded with tourists posing for photographs, attempting to capture the aforementioned picturesque quality of the river, while simultaneously avoiding getting run over by a gaggle of cyclists. So, the Neckar, she’s not a river that screams for attention, but she’s got a certain quiet charm, a reliable predictability that even a seasoned cynic like myself can appreciate… mostly.
