Now, this Coliseum, a grand, dilapidated absurdity it is, sitting smack-dab in the middle of Rome like a petrified biscuit left out in the Roman sun. One can't help but marvel at the sheer audacity of the place, capable of holding, they say, nigh on fifty thousand Romans, all eager for a bit of bloodshed and barbaric entertainment. Fifty thousand! Imagine the racket! Why, a flock of geese could scarcely make more noise, especially if you threatened to pluck them all for quill pens. The emperors, bless their tyrannical hearts, knew what the public wanted: not books and learning, mind you, but gladiators bashing each other about with swords until someone gave up the ghost. It’s a wonder they didn't offer odds on the matches, though I suspect some enterprising Roman chap probably did, under the table, so to speak, where the tax collectors weren't looking.

They even had a system of elevators, these Romans, to bring the wild beasts up from beneath the floor, ready to roar and terrify the poor souls who had to face them. Elevators! I daresay some of them were more reliable than the elevators in New York City today, which is saying something. Though, I suppose the consequences of a breakdown in Rome were a tad more…immediate. Think of the lawsuits! "Your Majesty, I paid good sestertii for a good mauling, not to be stuck underground with a disgruntled lion who probably skipped breakfast!" Of course, there’s some talk of Christians being tossed to these very same lions. It seems a bit harsh, doesn't it? Though I’m quite sure their prayers were well and truly answered, if a bit quicker than they anticipated. One does ponder how such a place of death and destruction could become a beloved landmark and tourist attraction, but then again, folks will pay good money to see just about anything these days, be it a relic from antiquity or a waxwork of a notorious murderer. It’s the human condition, I reckon, a peculiar blend of awe and morbid curiosity.
