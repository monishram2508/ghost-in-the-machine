Naples, ah, Naples! A city that assaults the senses like a rogue organ grinder with a particularly vigorous monkey. One is told it is a city of tremendous antiquity, layered with history like a lasagna left too long in the oven. Indeed, I daresay, one could dig down twenty feet and find oneself ankle-deep in Roman ruins, or perhaps a particularly ripe batch of tomatoes from some forgotten Vesuvian eruption, the latter probably being more useful at luncheon. The streets, bless their cobbled hearts, are narrow enough to shave with, and crowded with more hawkers than one finds fleas on a Neapolitan hound. These fellows, with voices like foghorns and elbows sharper than a Sicilian’s wit, will endeavor to sell you anything from a blessed scapular depicting a remarkably plump saint to a purported relic of Saint Gennaro himself, guaranteed, of course, to ward off misfortune, unless, as I suspect, the relic *is* the misfortune. The buildings lean against each other like gossiping old women, each trying to whisper secrets learned centuries ago, secrets mostly consisting, I imagine, of recipes for pasta and the proper way to avoid paying taxes. The washing hangs from every window like a flag of surrender to the relentless sun, a kaleidoscope of linens and undergarments offering a far more colorful spectacle than any government building I've yet encountered. And the smells! Good heavens, the smells! A heady mix of sea salt, frying fish, decaying refuse, and something vaguely resembling old gym socks, all conspiring to create an olfactory experience both deeply disturbing and, dare I say it, strangely compelling. Yes, Naples, a city where chaos reigns supreme, and yet, amidst the clamor and the grime, there lurks a certain undeniable charm, a roguish twinkle in the eye of the city, like a pickpocket who's just relieved you of your watch but winks at you in such a manner that you can’t help but admire his audacity. One leaves Naples feeling as if one has been thoroughly robbed, slightly nauseous, and secretly quite pleased with the whole affair.
