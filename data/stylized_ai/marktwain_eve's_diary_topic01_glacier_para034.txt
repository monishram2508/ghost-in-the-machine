Well, I reckon I've seen some sights in my time, from the Mississippi's muddy embrace to the shimmering mirages of the Nevada desert, but this glacier, bless its frozen heart, takes the cake, and the ice cream too, if it had a mind to. Now, they call it a river of ice, which strikes me as a bit of a poetical exaggeration, like calling a lazy politician a public servant. It's moving, sure, but with all the alacrity of a snail afflicted with rheumatism. You could knit yourself a whole set of winter woollies before you'd notice it budging an inch. And yet, they claim it carved out valleys and shifted mountains! Seems to me it had a powerful lot of help from gravity and a few million years, wouldn't you say?

Of course, it's got its charms. Shimmers like a drunken chandelier in the morning sun, all blues and greens and whites, enough to make a painter weep with joy or despair, depending on whether he's just had a drink or twenty. And the sounds! A symphony of creaks and groans and the occasional thunderous crack, like some giant beast is having a terrible case of indigestion. They say it's the ice breaking, naturally. But I suspect it's just the glacier grumbling about the modern age, what with all this pesky sunshine and warm weather threatening to turn it into a puddle fit for ducks. 

And the tourists! Good gracious, the tourists! Clambering all over it with their fancy cameras and their city clothes, slipping and sliding like so many penguins on a ballroom floor. They poke at the crevasses with their walking sticks and exclaim about the "awesome power of nature," never mind the perfectly good saloon just down the road that offers a far more immediate and satisfying demonstration of human ingenuity. Still, I suppose they're harmless enough, these ice-worshippers. They'll go home with their pictures and their stories, and the glacier will just keep on inching its way down the mountain, sighing softly about the good old days when ice was ice and summers were a little less insistent. And me? Well, I'll just be over here, enjoying a nice glass of something that isn't frozen, and contemplating the sheer, slow-motion absurdity of it all.
