Well, I declare, if I haven't stumbled upon the grandest confectionary creation this side of the Pearly Gates! Imagine, if you will, a river of ice, only this river don't flow with water, bless your heart. No, ma'am, it's a solid, milky sort of thing, blue as a jaybird's feather down deep, all frosty and forbidding. This "glacier," as the learned men call it, creeps down the mountain with the patience of a snail watching paint dry, which, I reckon, is faster than most things move in this world. They say it’s been at it for centuries, carving out valleys like a sculptor gone loco with a chisel. Now, I've seen my share of stubborn mules and politicians clinging to power, but this glacier, it takes the prize for persistence. It just keeps coming, slow and steady, grinding rocks to dust and leaving behind the prettiest little ponds, like teardrops from a giant blue-eyed baby.

And the sound! It's a groan, a sigh, a crackle like a thousand wood-burning stoves all deciding to pop at once. It sounds like the earth itself is rearranging the furniture, and none too pleased about it, either. Folks say it's the ice shifting and settling, but I suspect it's just Old Man Winter clearing his throat after a long nap. They also say it's shrinking, melting away like a snowman in July. Which is a darn shame, if you ask me. I mean, what's a mountain without its icy beard? Seems like nature's just getting lazy, or maybe she's just tired of carrying around all that ice. Either way, it's a sight to behold, this glacier. A mighty, magnificent, and utterly confounding spectacle. Makes you wonder what other grand surprises Mother Nature has tucked up her sleeve, doesn’t it? Probably something equally ridiculous and awe-inspiring, I expect. Land sakes, I better not get started on volcanoes, I'll be here all day.
