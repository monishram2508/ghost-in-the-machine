Naples, ah, Naples! A city sprawling like a beggar's hand, begging for scraps of decency yet overflowing with a charm as potent as Vesuvius is volatile. One can't rightly say what struck me most – the laundry strung between tenements like festive banners proclaiming the poverty within, or the operatic cries of hawkers selling everything from roasted chestnuts to dubious religious relics. The Neapolitan, you see, is a creature born of the sun and the sea, and he conducts his business with a theatrical flair that would shame the most seasoned thespian. He gesticulates with a ferocity that suggests he's arguing for his very life, even when merely bartering over the price of a tomato. And heavens, the driving! One navigates the streets not with the aid of logic or reason, but through a sort of perilous prayer, hoping to emerge on the other side with limbs and soul intact. Horses, motorcars, and handcarts tangle together in a glorious, cacophonous mess, a symphony of near-misses punctuated by the blare of horns and the colorful curses that seem to be the native tongue. One expects at any moment to witness a full-scale collision, but somehow, magically, disaster is averted, time and again. Then there's the matter of the beggars. They are, without a doubt, the most inventive and persistent mendicants I've ever encountered. Some feign ailments with such dramatic conviction that one almost feels compelled to bequeath them one's entire fortune. Others offer services – shining shoes already gleaming, serenading you with off-key melodies – all for a pittance, or, failing that, a sympathetic ear. Yet, despite the grime, the chaos, the pervasive sense of impending doom, there's a vitality to Naples that is undeniably infectious. It's a city that wears its heart on its sleeve, a city that refuses to be sanitized or tamed. One can find prettier cities, certainly, and cleaner ones, but one will be hard-pressed to find another with such raw, unadulterated character. It’s a place where life, in all its messy glory, is lived out in the open, for all the world to see, and to laugh, perhaps a little ruefully, along with.
