Winter, ah, a season that the poets, bless their optimistic hearts, like to prattle on about as a time of "crisp air" and "sparkling wonderlands." Now, I've spent enough winters holed up in cabins that leak more than a politician's promises, to know a thing or two about that particular brand of humbug. Crisp air, you say? More like air that'll freeze your whiskers so stiff, you'll be mistaking yourself for a walrus in the mirror. Sparkling wonderland? Try a monotonous landscape of white, punctuated only by the occasional, skeletal tree lookin' as dejected as a miner who's struck nothing but fool's gold for six months straight.

The snow itself, that fickle beast, is another story entirely. One day it's fallin' like goose feathers plucked by an angel choir, soft and gentle, makin' the world look almost halfway decent. The next, it's comin' down in sheets thicker than a preacher's sermon, buryin' everything you hold dear – including, on more than one unfortunate occasion, my woodpile. And don't even get me started on the ice. That sly devil lurks beneath the snow, waitin' for you to take an unsuspecting step so it can send you sprawling on your backside faster than a greased pig at a county fair. You'll swear you've seen stars you never even knew existed. Then there's the matter of keeping warm. A man could burn through an entire forest and still feel like he's shiverin' down to his very bones. And let's not forget the delightful pastime of shoveling snow. It's a task that makes a strong man feel like a consumptive invalid in a matter of hours, all the while contributing precisely nothing to the betterment of mankind. So, yes, winter. A season of unparalleled beauty, if you happen to be a polar bear or a government bureaucrat who only experiences it from the plush comfort of a heated office. For the rest of us, it's just a long, cold, inconvenient stretch of time we must endure before the blessed arrival of spring, when we can finally thaw out our dispositions and start complainin' about somethin' else entirely.
