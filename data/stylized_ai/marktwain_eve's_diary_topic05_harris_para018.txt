Harris, now there's a specimen. A man built seemingly of spare parts, none of which quite fit together in the expected fashion. He possessed a head that looked like it had been cobbled together from leftover granite, bolted onto a neck that appeared surprisingly vulnerable beneath it. A neck, mind you, that he perpetually strained to elevate, as if perpetually searching for a better view, or perhaps simply avoiding eye contact, which, truth be told, was a wise pursuit in most instances. His mustache, a bristly affair that resembled a startled caterpillar clinging desperately to his upper lip, quivered with a life of its own, betraying emotions Harris himself seemed incapable of expressing.

He was a man of pronouncements, Harris was. He’d hold forth on any topic, from the breeding habits of the Peruvian dung beetle to the proper application of axle grease on a steamboat engine, with the unwavering conviction of a preacher in full sermon. Never mind that his knowledge of either subject was, shall we say, generously diluted with pure, unadulterated balderdash. The beauty of Harris, though, was that he believed every word he uttered. He was a walking, talking encyclopedia of misinformation, bound in a cover of unwavering self-assurance.

And his clothes! Bless his heart, he dressed as if he'd been attacked by a haberdasher gone mad. He favoured trousers that bagged at the knees like disappointed expectations and a coat, invariably several sizes too large, that billowed behind him like a tattered battle flag. One suspected he acquired his wardrobe by rummaging through a deceased giant’s trunk. Yet, there was a certain charm to his utter lack of sartorial grace, an almost childlike innocence in his obliviousness to the general aesthetic calamity he presented to the world. He was, in the final analysis, a monument to the glorious and enduring potential of the human spirit to misunderstand, misinterpret, and misrepresent absolutely everything with boundless enthusiasm. A character, indeed. One you would find yourself shaking your head at one moment, and the next, you would be smiling at his utter absurdity.
