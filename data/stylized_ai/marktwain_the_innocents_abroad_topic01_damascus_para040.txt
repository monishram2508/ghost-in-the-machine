Now, Damascus, they say it’s the oldest inhabited city in the world, which is a claim as dubious as a politician's promise. I reckon folks have been squatting in convenient spots since the dawn of time, and Damascus just got the better public relations department. Still, there’s an undeniable air of antiquity about the place, like your great aunt’s attic, crammed full of relics that smell faintly of mothballs and forgotten empires. You wander through those ancient alleyways, dodging donkeys and hawkers selling wares that look suspiciously like they were liberated from King Tut’s tomb, and you get the distinct feeling that history isn’t just a subject in school, it's actively trying to trip you. The Grand Bazaar, ah, the Grand Bazaar! A glorious, chaotic jumble of sights, sounds, and smells that assaults the senses like a brass band playing a funeral dirge. You’ll find everything from silken carpets fit for a sultan to questionable spices that could probably cure boils, induce hallucinations, or both, depending on your constitution. You bargain with merchants whose faces are etched with more history than a dusty scroll, and you suspect they’re laughing at you the whole time, even when you think you’ve gotten a good deal. Which, let’s be honest, you haven’t.

And the food! Lord have mercy, the food! It's a culinary tapestry woven from a thousand years of culinary tradition. Meats marinated in mysteries, pastries swimming in honey so sweet it’ll make your teeth ache, and fruits so ripe they threaten to burst in your hand. You eat, you drink, you feel like a Roman Emperor at a feast, until you remember that you’re probably going to regret this later when your stomach starts staging its own internal revolution. But then you shrug it off and order another plate of baklava, because, well, you only live once, and if dying of sugar overload in Damascus isn't a grand way to go, then I don't know what is. So, Damascus, a city of contradictions, a city of wonders, a city where the past is as present as the dust clinging to your shoes. Go see it, by all means. Just bring a strong constitution, a healthy sense of humor, and a willingness to be utterly and completely bamboozled. You won't regret it, probably.
