Now, a sepulchre, as I understand it, ain't just your run-of-the-mill hole in the ground where you chuck Uncle Jedediah after he's finally kicked the bucket chasing that phantom gold strike. No, sir, a sepulchre's got aspirations. It's a vault, a mausoleum, a veritable real estate play for the dearly departed, only the departed ain’t doing no decorating, less you count the dust bunnies and the odd spider web festooned like mourning crepe. I seen sepulchres carved right into hillsides, looked like giant teeth gnawing at the landscape, and others erected above ground, grandiose affairs with pillars and friezes, tryin' to convince you the fella inside was some kind of Roman emperor 'stead of just old Silas, who owed half the town money and had a nose for trouble like a hog for truffles.

And the inscriptions! Lord have mercy, the inscriptions. You'd think every resident of these stone hotels was a paragon of virtue, a selfless philanthropist, a scholar of unparalleled intellect. Never a mention of the time Mildred ran off with the traveling salesman, or that Pa swindled the railroad out of twenty acres, oh no. Just flowery prose and carefully polished lies, all designed to fool posterity, as if posterity ain't got better things to do than read epitaphs. Why, I reckon if tombstones told the honest truth, graveyards would be the most entertainin' places in the world, even more so than a medicine show with a particularly acrobatic monkey. But, alas, folks seem to think death demands a certain level of decorum, which is a mighty inconvenient rule when you consider most folks ain't decorous in the slightest while they're still breathin'. So, the sepulchre stands, a grand and silent lie, a testament to the lengths we'll go to to pretty up a grim situation, and proof that even in death, a little bit of humbuggery goes a long, long way.
