Now, about this creature they call the chamois, a mountain goat, of sorts, but Frenchified, as if mere goatishness weren't enough. A droll little animal it is, perched up there on those Swiss Alps like a debutante at a ball she wasn't invited to, all nervous energy and darting eyes. One imagines them thinking, "Oh, the embarrassment! Mustn't be caught flat-footed! Dash off behind that precipice before someone notices my unfashionable hooves." And off they scamper, these spindly-legged fellows, leaving behind only a lingering suspicion of damp earth and perhaps a stray pellet or two as evidence of their visit.

It's said they're terribly agile, these chamois. I reckon that's to compensate for their utter lack of common sense. Why else would any creature in its right mind choose to live on a patch of rock where a good sneeze could send it tumbling into the next valley? I've watched them, you see, from a safe distance, naturally, as I'm no chamois myself, though I do admit a fondness for a good precipice now and then. And I've concluded that their existence is one part skillful maneuvering, one part sheer, dumb luck, and a healthy dollop of the will to survive no matter how foolish the chosen location.

They’re hunted, of course. Man, in his infinite wisdom, believes he has a right to anything that moves, especially if it’s living in a place he finds picturesque. But I suspect the chamois enjoy the game. It gives them something to do between naps and staring wistfully at the glaciers. And besides, who knows, maybe they secretly enjoy the attention, the thrill of being chased. After all, even a chamois, I imagine, yearns for a bit of excitement in its humdrum existence, even if that excitement takes the form of a rifle aimed squarely at its backside. The alternative, I suppose, is to just sit there, contemplating the existential dread of being a goat on a mountain, which I'm told, can lead to melancholy and the development of a most unbecoming beard.
