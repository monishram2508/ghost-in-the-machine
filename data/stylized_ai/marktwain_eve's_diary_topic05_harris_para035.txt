Harris, now there's a specimen for the natural history museum, a walking, talking diorama of misplaced enthusiasm. He’s got the sort of earnestness that could power a small steamboat, and the sense of direction of a blindfolded kitten in a yarn factory. I recall one time, out camping near Hannibal, a locale even a mule could navigate in its sleep, he insisted on leading the way to the "secret fishing hole" his uncle Silas swore teemed with catfish the size of small dogs. Mind you, Silas probably swore the moon was made of Limburger cheese, but Harris, bless his simple soul, swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. We followed him through briar patches that held onto our trousers like jealous sweethearts, across gullies that threatened to swallow our boots whole, and around trees that seemed to take a perverse pleasure in whacking us upside the head with their lower branches. After a solid four hours of this wilderness purgatory, where the only thing biting were mosquitoes with delusions of grandeur, we ended up right back where we started, staring at our own campfire. Harris, oblivious as ever, declared triumphantly that we had successfully completed the “scenic loop” and that the fishing hole must have simply been “resting.” He then proceeded to cast his line into a puddle barely large enough to accommodate a goldfish, his face lit with a hopeful glow usually reserved for angels and lottery winners. And the irony, you see, is that despite his utter lack of competence in practical matters, Harris possessed a charm that could disarm a rattlesnake. He’d apologize for leading us astray with such genuine sorrow that you’d feel compelled to thank *him* for the opportunity to suffer in the wilderness. It’s a gift, really, this knack for turning catastrophe into comedy. Or perhaps, I think, it’s just the natural consequence of being profoundly, beautifully, and utterly lost in the world.
