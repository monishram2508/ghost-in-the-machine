Brigham, now there was a fellow cut from a different bolt of cloth altogether. Not that I ever cottoned to the man myself, mind you, what with all the wives and pronouncements from on high. Reminded me of a Missouri riverboat captain, full of bluster and a secret fondness for poker, except instead of riverboats he was ferrying his flock across a desert sea of dust and grit. They said he could conjure water where there was none, though I suspect it was more a matter of knowing where the darn springs were hidden, not actual magic. Saw him once, standing on a makeshift platform, bellowing instructions for irrigation ditches like he was commanding the tides themselves. The sun beat down something fierce, and the poor souls working those ditches looked ready to collapse, but nobody dared stop. Brigham had a way of looking right through a fella, making you feel about as significant as a tumbleweed.

He built up Salt Lake City, alright, no denying that. Started from nothin’ but sagebrush and promises, and ended up with a town respectable enough to boast a decent saloon and a surprisingly ornate tabernacle. Still, couldn’t help but think of it as a grand, if somewhat dusty, stage play with Brigham pulling all the strings. He had folks believing they were building Zion, when half the time they were just building Brigham’s empire. And the loyalty! Why, you could insult their mothers, call their oxen names, and generally make yourself a nuisance, but the moment you spoke a bad word against Brigham, you’d find yourself staring down a dozen pairs of unwavering eyes. Scared me some, I confess. Reminded me of them ants out in Nevada – buildin' grand colonies with nobody in charge - I'm joking of course - Brigham was definetly in charge. Still, I'll say this for the man. He took a bunch of folks nobody else wanted, and turned them into somethin'. Whether that somethin' was saintly or just plain stubborn, well, that’s a debate I’ll leave to the theologians. Me, I'd rather stick to prospectin'. Less complicated, and far less chance of endin' up hitched to a dozen wives.
