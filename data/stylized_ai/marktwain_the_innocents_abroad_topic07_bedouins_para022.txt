Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked hides, are a peculiar lot, wouldn’t you agree? They roam about the Arabian deserts like tumbleweeds with purpose, or perhaps more accurately, tumbleweeds with camels. And what camels they are! Humps swaying like a politician's promises, long necks held high with an air of disdain reserved only for those who haven't spent their lives ingesting sand. You'd think after centuries of wandering they’d have found something better to do, perhaps invent the parasol or at least discover the merits of an afternoon siesta under a palm tree (provided they could find one, mind you, which isn’t exactly plentiful in that sandy expanse). But no, they persist in their nomadic ways, a stubborn testament to the enduring power of tradition, or perhaps just a crippling fear of settling down and facing the reality of indoor plumbing.

They live in tents woven from goat hair, which smell precisely like you imagine goat hair would after a prolonged exposure to the Arabian sun. It’s an aroma that clings to everything – their clothing, their cooking pots, and even, I suspect, their souls. And their hospitality! Why, it's enough to make a teetotaler crave a glass of something strong. They offer dates and bitter coffee with a fervor that suggests they're daring you to refuse. Refusal, of course, is considered an insult roughly on par with suggesting their camel is ugly (a proposition I wouldn't recommend testing, unless you’re particularly fond of footraces across burning sand). They’re a hardy bunch, these Bedouins. They can navigate by the stars, survive on next to nothing, and haggle the price of a rug down to a point that would make even a used-car salesman blush. All in all, they're a reminder that some folks are content to live life on their own terms, even if those terms involve a lot of sand and a distinct lack of comfortable furniture. One might even say they've achieved a kind of freedom, though I suspect it's the kind that comes with a rather hefty price tag of dust, sweat, and the occasional encounter with a scorpion.
