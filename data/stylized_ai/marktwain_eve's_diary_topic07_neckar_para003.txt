Ah, the Neckar. A river that, upon first acquaintance, doesn't exactly shout "Grandeur!" from the rooftops. More like whispers it politely, whilst simultaneously trying to sell you a cuckoo clock. I've seen rivers with a more audacious swagger, rivers that throw waterfalls around like confetti, rivers that roar and bellow and generally make a nuisance of themselves. This Neckar, though, is altogether more circumspect. It meanders, bless its heart, through landscapes that are agreeably picturesque, mind you – all vineyards clinging to hillsides like thirsty spiders, and ancient castles perched atop them, looking down their noses at the modern world. One can almost picture the knights within, grumbling about the price of mead and the lack of decent dragons these days.

But the river itself, it's a working river, see? Not one for idle displays of temper. It's got things to do, barges to haul, cities to reflect in its rather murky surface. Heidelberg, now there's a city that owes a debt of gratitude to the Neckar. A lovely old jumble of romantic ruins and student pranksters, all thriving on the river's gentle patronage. One imagines the Neckar, every so often, chuckling to itself, thinking, "I could flood the whole lot of 'em, you know. But where would they be without me and all this scenic, river-based charm?"

And, of course, the Neckar provides. It provides those quaint little riverside restaurants where one can sit and consume alarming quantities of sausage and beer, watching the aforementioned barges chug past, laden with goodness knows what. Probably more cuckoo clocks. One can even partake in a river cruise, should one be so inclined, though I'd wager the most exciting thing you'll see is a particularly persistent duck. Still, it's peaceful. Undeniably peaceful. A little boring, perhaps, if you're expecting the Mississippi, but in its own quiet, German way, the Neckar is a charmer. Just don't expect it to set your soul aflame. More likely, it'll just offer you a pleasant cup of tea and a polite suggestion to admire the view. And, frankly, sometimes, that's exactly what a body needs.
