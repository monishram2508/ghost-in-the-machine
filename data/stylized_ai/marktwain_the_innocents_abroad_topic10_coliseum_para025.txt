Now, the Colosseum, that grand old ruin. A place where, they say, lions and gladiators entertained the populace, though I suspect half the crowd was more interested in their neighbor’s dropped fig than any mortal combat. And a grand sight it is, I grant you, even in its decayed condition. Enough stone there to build a small town, if you had the patience, and the slaves, naturally. They don’t mention the slaves much anymore, do they? Rather spoils the heroic grandeur of it all, I suppose. One can almost hear the roar of the crowd, cheering on some poor fellow who’d likely rather be back home, tending his goat or arguing with his wife, than getting skewered by a Thracian with a net. 

They say it held fifty thousand souls, crammed in like sardines in a tin. Imagine the noise! And the smells! I daresay the fragrance of sweat and cheap wine was more potent than any gladiatorial perfume. And the plumbing, or lack thereof! One shudders to think of the hygienic arrangements for such a multitude. Doubtless, the surrounding streets reeked for miles on end. The romanticists conveniently omit such mundane details.

And the architects! Clever fellows, undoubtedly, to construct such a behemoth. But I wager they never had to face the wrath of a Roman Senator who couldn't find his reserved seat. Now that would have been a spectacle worth seeing, wouldn't it? A dignified patrician, sputtering with indignation and waving his scroll like a weapon. Far more entertaining, I suspect, than watching two chaps with swords trying to disembowel each other. Though, perhaps, the Senator *would* have preferred that method of settling his grievances, come to think of it. Human nature, you see, hasn’t changed a whit since then. Just swap the Senator for a modern politician and the scroll for a Twitter account, and you have a perfectly analogous situation. Progress, they call it. I call it different packaging for the same old nonsense.
