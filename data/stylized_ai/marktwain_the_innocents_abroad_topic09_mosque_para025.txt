Now, concerning this edifice they call a mosque, well, it's a sight, I tell you, a sight indeed. Not in the same way a Mississippi steamboat is a sight, mind you, all gingerbread trim and churning smoke, but a sight nonetheless. Imagine, if you will, a structure striving mightily to reach the heavens, doing so with minarets that prick the sky like so many pious needles. They say from these towers, fellows with lungs of leather call the faithful to prayer, five times a day! Enough to make a man deaf as a post if he lingered too long. Inside, it’s all carpets and arches, a labyrinth of patterns enough to dizzy a fly, let alone a man accustomed to plain speaking and simpler designs. No pews, mind you, none of that civilized sitting down. Oh no, here folks kneel, faces toward Mecca, a city I've never seen but hear tell is hotter than a gambler's conscience after a bad hand.

They take their shoes off at the door, these mosque-goers, leaving them in a heap like so many discarded responsibilities. A wise move, perhaps, for who wouldn't want to shed a few burdens before bending the knee to the Almighty? I've watched them, these worshippers, their faces etched with a solemnity that's either deeply sincere or a masterful performance, I couldn’t say which, as hypocrisy is a universal tongue spoken fluently in all houses of worship, methinks. There's a quiet hum about the place, a low thrum of devotion that settles on you like dust. It's a powerful thing, faith, and a curious one. Seems to me, believing in things you can't see or touch is a risky business, like investing in a gold mine based on the word of a one-eyed prospector. Still, who am I to judge? After all, humans have always been prone to believing in something, be it ghosts, politicians, or the efficacy of patent medicine. And this mosque, well, it's just another testament to that enduring, baffling human tendency. A grand, perplexing, and undeniably impressive testament, at that.
