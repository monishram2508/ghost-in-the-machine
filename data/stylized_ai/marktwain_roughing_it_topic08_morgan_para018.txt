Morgan, now there was a specimen. A fellow you wouldn’t trust to hold your hat while you jumped across a puddle, let alone with anything of real consequence. He drifted into these here parts lookin’ like a scarecrow that’d lost a fight with a dust devil, all elbows and angles, and hair that resembled a bird's nest after a particularly rambunctious squabble. Claimed he was a surveyor, which struck me as curious seeing as he couldn’t tell a juniper from a jackrabbit. Spent most of his days leanin’ against the saloon wall, watchin’ the tumbleweeds dance and spouting pronouncements on matters he clearly knew nothin’ about. Had an opinion on everything, from the proper way to pan for gold (which he’d never done, mind you) to the intricate workings of the female mind (which, I suspect, was a territory as foreign to him as the moon).

He possessed a peculiar talent for bein’ consistently, and hilariously, wrong. One time, he declared with absolute certainty that the Comstock Lode would run dry within the month. Three weeks later, they struck a vein so rich it practically choked the miners. Another time, he tried to pass off a common field mouse as a rare species of “desert vole,” much to the amusement of every mule skinner and prospector within earshot. Still, you couldn’t help but find the fella entertainin’, in a morbid sort of way. Like watchin’ a dog try to catch its tail – futile, but undeniably amusing. He was a livin’, breathin’ testament to the notion that confidence, however misplaced, can carry a man further than genuine skill. And he was a reminder that even in a land full of grit and gold, there was always room for a touch of harmless foolishness to lighten the load. Heaven knows we needed it.
