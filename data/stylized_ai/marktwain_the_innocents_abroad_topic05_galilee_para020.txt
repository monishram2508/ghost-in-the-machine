Now, Galilee, bless its heart, is not exactly the sort of place that'll knock your spectacles off with its grandeur. It’s no Rome, you see, with its crumbling empires and enough marble to pave the devil's own highway. Nor is it a Paris, dripping with so much gilded frippery a body can hardly see the sky for all the artifice. Galilee is…well, Galilee is *rustic*. That’s a polite word, mind you. One might also say it’s a bit plain, like a preacher’s Sunday sermon after a long week. 

The landscape rolls along gentle-like, hills that wouldn’t dare call themselves mountains, dotted with olive groves that look older than Methuselah's beard. The Sea of Galilee, or Lake Tiberias as some fancy folk call it, is pleasant enough, a sheet of blue shimmering in the sun. But don’t go expecting Niagara Falls to come roaring out of it. It's more of a large puddle, really, though I dare say it has its uses for baptizing and the like. 

The towns, ah, the towns! Why, they are quaint, bless them, in the way that a dusty attic is quaint. Nazareth, for instance, I hear tell a feller once resided there by the name of Jesus, but the town itself appears to have taken a nap ever since. Things move at a pace that would make a snail blush. There are fishermen, of course, hauling in enough fish to feed a sparrow, and farmers scratching a living from the stony soil. And you will encounter pilgrims, earnest and sunburned, squinting at the supposed sites of this miracle and that, and no doubt paying a handsome price for the privilege. 

I wouldn’t want to give the impression that Galilee is entirely devoid of charm, however. It has a certain…authenticity, you see. It’s honest, unvarnished. It’s the sort of place where you can sit on a hillside, watch the sun set over the water, and contemplate the mysteries of existence without being bothered by a horde of souvenir hawkers. Provided, that is, you don't venture too close to the holy sites. Then you are fair game, I’m afraid. But away from the fray, Galilee offers a quiet, unpretentious beauty, like a plain woman with a kind heart. It may not steal your breath, but it might just steal a little piece of your soul.
