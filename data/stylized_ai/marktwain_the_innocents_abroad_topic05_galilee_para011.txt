Galilee, they call it. Well, I call it dusty. And hilly. Don't let them fool you with talk of verdant landscapes and blossoming orchards. Oh, there's greenery enough, if you fancy scrubby bushes and the occasional, bravely optimistic olive tree clinging to a rock face. And water? The Sea of Galilee, they say, shimmers like a jewel. Shimmers like a slightly tarnished, lukewarm coin, more like. I’ve seen dishwater with more sparkle. They say it’s teeming with fish, enough to feed a multitude, and maybe it is, if you count each sardine as a full course. I wouldn’t wager my best pair of boots on landing a decent trout. The villages are… charming, in the way a toothache is charming, perhaps. Cramped little affairs, all crooked streets and howling dogs. Houses stacked one atop another like a drunken mason had the contract. The people, bless their cotton socks (if they wore cotton socks, which they don’t), are friendly enough, offering you dates that stick to your teeth like a stubborn memory, and smiles that might mean “welcome,” or might mean “how much money can I fleece from this pilgrim?” Hard to tell, with all the dust swirling about, obscuring everything like a moral dilemma. The air hangs heavy with the scent of donkey droppings and unfulfilled potential. Still, there's a certain…authenticity to the place, a raw, unvarnished quality that you won't find in your fancy European capitals. Like finding a diamond in a dung heap, you might have to sift through a fair bit of muck to appreciate it. But maybe, just maybe, there’s something genuine lurking beneath the surface of this dusty, hilly, somewhat underwhelming land. Just don’t expect miracles. Or a decent cup of coffee.
