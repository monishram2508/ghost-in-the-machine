Now, the Neckar. Bless its meandering heart. I've seen rivers before, mind you, rivers that swell with such pomposity they practically demand you write odes to their grandeur. The Neckar, though, she’s a different creature altogether. She doesn't swagger; she saunters. She hasn’t the ego to pretend she’s carving out the Grand Canyon, no sir, she just sort of ambles along, content to let the grapevines and half-timbered towns take center stage. I reckon if you asked her, she’d tell you she’s just holding the scenery together, providing a convenient mirror for the swans to admire their own reflections (and, upon closer inspection, preen themselves with an almost offensive level of narcissism).

You might think, observing her tranquil surface, that nothing momentous ever transpires upon the Neckar. Ah, but you'd be wrong. I once witnessed a flotilla of rubber duckies, likely liberated from a particularly mischievous child, staging a miniature naval battle near Heidelberg Castle. A fearsome affair, I assure you, though the casualties were limited to a few upside-down ducks and a lingering sense of existential dread, I suspect, for those left adrift. And the locals, they treat the river with a casual familiarity that borders on affection. Fishermen cast their lines with the weary optimism of men who know they’re more likely to catch a cold than a carp, while lovers stroll along its banks, whispering sweet nothings that are promptly carried away by the gentle current, probably to be misheard by a gaggle of geese downstream. It's a perfectly ordinary river, really, but sometimes, just sometimes, when the sun catches the water just so, and the air is thick with the scent of ripening grapes, you could almost believe it holds some hidden magic. Almost. Though, of course, that’s probably just the wine talking.
