Well, I reckon I spent a spell out in Utah Territory, saw more’n my fair share of them Mormons. A curious bunch, they are, industrious as beavers, though maybe a tad too eager to have you join their hive. Salt Lake City, now that’s a sight, all grid-patterned streets and Brigham Young’s hand stamped on everything, from the temple that looks like a fortress against skepticism to the fields blooming under irrigation, a testament to their grit, even if the grit’s seasoned with a good dollop of religious fervor. They believe, these Mormons, believe something fierce. You can see it in their eyes, that unwavering conviction, like a mule set on a particular patch of clover. Makes a feller wonder, what secret tonic they’re sippin' on to keep the doubt at bay.

I heard tales aplenty, of course, about their peculiar habits. Why, a fella can’t hardly strike up a conversation without someone mentioning polygamy, whispers and scandalized gasps following close behind. But truth be told, seemed to me most families were just folks, workin' hard, raisin' young’uns, and tryin' to make an honest dollar—or, more accurately, a tenth of a dollar to give back to the church. Of course, there were whispers of tithing men with bulging pockets, but you get that kind of gossip wherever folks gather and money’s involved. Brigham Young, he was a figure to behold, a Moses of the desert, leading his flock to the promised land, even if the promised land did require a whole lot of plowing and praying. One time, I saw him pass by in his carriage, looking as grim and solid as a mountain range, and I swear, the very air around him seemed to stiffen with respect. A hard man, no doubt, but a leader, through and through. Whether you agreed with his notions or not, you had to admire his tenacity. All in all, the Mormons, a conundrum wrapped in a riddle, and sprinkled with a hefty dose of desert dust.
