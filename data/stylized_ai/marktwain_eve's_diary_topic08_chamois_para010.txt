I must confess, I've never been properly introduced to this chamois creature face-to-face, though I’ve read about them in books where brave mountaineers dangle off precipices, clinging to life and a smattering of dignity while these four-legged daredevils prance about like they own the whole blessed mountain. It’s said they reside in the Alps, the Pyrenees, and other such lofty, inconvenient places where a sensible person wouldn't dream of venturing without a substantial supply of gingerbread and a mule trained in the art of conversation. These chamois, you see, they're goats, more or less, though calling them 'goat' feels akin to calling the Sphinx a glorified paperweight; there's a certain grandeur, a dash of the theatrical, about them that transcends such commonplace labeling. They have these peculiar horns, hooked backwards like disgruntled commas questioning the sanity of the universe, and coats of varying brown, as if they can't quite decide what sort of tweed would be most flattering for a life lived perpetually on a slant.

And agile! Oh, the agility! They say a chamois can leap ten feet in a single bound, which sounds to me suspiciously like the sort of exaggeration a man tells after a particularly bracing glass of schnapps. Still, one must concede they’re remarkably sprightly, bounding about the rocky terrain like children chasing butterflies – only, instead of butterflies, it's gravity they seem to be evading with such practiced nonchalance. I imagine their conversations are rather short, peppered with grunts and the occasional bleat expressing either profound wisdom or the urgent need to find a particularly succulent patch of alpine grass. One can only imagine the gossip of those mountains; a chorus of bleats and whistles carried on the wind, discussing the latest avalanche, the foolishness of low-landers, and perhaps, if one is truly lucky, the best method for polishing one's horns to a dazzling sheen. All in all, these chamois seem to live a rather enviable existence, high above the pettiness and prevarications of the world below, which leads me to believe that if I were to be reincarnated, I should aim to be one of these animals. Barring that, I'd settle for being the mule that converses.
