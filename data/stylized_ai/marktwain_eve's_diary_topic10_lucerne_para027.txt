Lucerne, bless its heart, sits there on the edge of that lake, looking as picturesque as a Christmas card painted by a Sunday school teacher with a fondness for swans. You’d think, after centuries of preening itself in the Alps' reflection, it might have grown a tad vain, but no. It keeps on being all clean streets and quaint shops, as though expecting a visit from a committee of exceptionally proper angels any minute now. The place is thick with tourists, of course, all toting those infernal photographic contraptions like they’re hunting rare game, and snapping away at every cobblestone and half-timbered house in sight. One almost expects to see 'em start posing for pictures in the fountain, all dripping wet and grinning like fools. The Lion Monument, that poor beast carved into the rock, is perpetually surrounded by a gaggle of them, each vying for the perfect angle to capture its mournful expression. It’s a marvel, really, that the poor creature hasn't crumbled to dust from the sheer mortification.

And the lake! Oh, that lake. So blue, so serene, so utterly…Swiss. You half expect Heidi herself to come skipping down the mountainside any moment, yodeling fit to wake the dead. One sees the paddle steamers chugging about, filled with more tourists, naturally, all pointing and oohing and aahing at the scenery. It's a perfect picture of leisure, like a postcard sent from paradise, except the paradise is charging you seven francs for a cup of coffee the size of a thimble. Honestly, the place is so pristine, so orderly, so impeccably…well, Swiss, it's almost enough to make a body long for a good, old-fashioned mud puddle and a bit of honest chaos. But then, one glimpses the mountains rising majestic in the distance, and one remembers why folks come here in droves. Lucerne might be a bit precious, a bit overly polished, but it's got a charm about it, a stubborn refusal to be anything other than utterly delightful, that’s hard to resist. You can poke fun at its perfection all you like, but at the end of the day, you have to admit: it’s got a certain something. Even if that something is a staggering bill for afternoon tea.
