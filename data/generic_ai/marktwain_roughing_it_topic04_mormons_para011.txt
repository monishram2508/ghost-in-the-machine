The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a Christian restorationist religious organization founded by Joseph Smith in the United States in 1830. A defining characteristic of Mormonism is its belief in ongoing revelation and an expanded scriptural canon beyond the Bible. This includes the Book of Mormon, which members believe to be another testament of Jesus Christ and a historical record of ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Other foundational texts include the Doctrine and Covenants, a compilation of revelations and declarations regarding the organization and doctrine of the Church, and the Pearl of Great Price, a selection of inspired writings including extracts from the Book of Moses and the Book of Abraham.

Central to Mormon theology is the concept of the Godhead, which consists of three distinct and separate beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. They emphasize the importance of Jesus Christ’s atonement and resurrection for the salvation of humankind. Latter-day Saints believe in the potential for eternal progression, that through faith, repentance, and obedience to God’s commandments, individuals can ultimately achieve exaltation and live eternally in God’s presence. Family is considered paramount, and temple rituals, including marriage for eternity, play a significant role in their religious practice.

Active members of the Church adhere to a strict code of conduct, emphasizing honesty, integrity, and service to others. The "Word of Wisdom" is a health code that prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. Latter-day Saints are also known for their strong emphasis on missionary work, with young men and women often volunteering for two-year missions to proselyte and serve in communities around the world. The Church has a lay clergy, meaning that local leaders are unpaid volunteers. They are known for their extensive humanitarian efforts, providing disaster relief and development assistance globally. The Church has grown significantly since its founding and maintains a presence in numerous countries, contributing to diverse fields such as education, business, and the arts.
