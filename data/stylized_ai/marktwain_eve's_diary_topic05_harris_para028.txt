Harris, now there's a specimen I've encountered more times than I care to admit, mostly lurking about the edges of social gatherings like a particularly persistent housefly around a honey pot. He possesses that peculiar brand of earnestness that’s somehow both endearing and deeply suspicious, like a dog wagging its tail a bit too vigorously. He strikes me as the sort who considers himself a font of wisdom, when really he's more of a dribbling faucet of platitudes. I recall one unfortunate evening, trapped beside him at a charity benefit – for the "Save the Snail Darter" foundation, no less – where he regaled me with tales of his golfing prowess, tales that grew taller and more improbable with each passing mint julep. He spoke of eagles, of birdies, of conquering the green with a majesty that, frankly, would have made Julius Caesar blush. Yet, I'd wager a silver dollar he couldn’t sink a putt if his life depended on it. 

The man is a walking paradox, a collection of well-meaning intentions wrapped in a thick fog of self-deception. He's forever embarking on grand projects – writing the great American novel (which, last I heard, was still stuck on chapter one), learning to play the ukulele (a disaster best left unmentioned), mastering the art of sourdough bread-making (resulting in loaves that could double as doorstops). He attacks these endeavors with the fervor of a man possessed, only to abandon them a few weeks later, citing unforeseen complications or, more likely, discovering a new, equally ambitious distraction. He has this way of looking at you, eyes wide with a childlike wonder, as if he's just unearthed the secret to the universe, which generally involves something utterly mundane, like the proper way to fold a fitted sheet. Bless his heart, the man is a harmless sort, a dreamer adrift in a sea of practicality, and probably the best example of the human condition I've seen this year.
