Ah, Naples! A city where, as they say, "See Naples and die!" Though, personally, I’d amend that to “See Naples and then spend a week trying to digest all the impressions, aromas, and questionable culinary choices you’ve made before even *thinking* about dying.” It's a place where the streets are so narrow, a fat man with a fiddle could barely squeeze through, and the washing hangs overhead like a festive garland, though I suspect some of it has been there since the Roman Empire, lending it a certain… *patina*. One might fancy oneself transported back in time, were it not for the Vespas buzzing about like angry hornets, each piloted by a fellow seemingly convinced he’s auditioning for a role in a newfangled chariot race.

The people, bless their demonstrative souls, are a study in contrasts. One moment they're gesticulating wildly, engaged in a debate that sounds suspiciously like a barroom brawl set to opera, the next they're offering you a piece of their grandmother's biscotti, which, mind you, is harder than the cobblestones underfoot. And the noise! Good heavens, the noise! It's a symphony of car horns, shouted bargains, operatic arias escaping open windows, and the incessant chatter of a thousand Neapolitans all vying to be the loudest in the vicinity. One might think the city was perpetually on the verge of spontaneous combustion, fuelled by passion and espresso. And then there's Vesuvius, looming in the background like a disgruntled uncle, reminding everyone that Naples is built upon a foundation of ash and uncertainty. A delightful place, Naples, though one does wonder if its inhabitants haven't made a pact with some mischievous imp to ensure that tranquility remains a mere rumour. Just try ordering a simple cup of coffee without getting a lecture on the proper roasting techniques, the superiority of Neapolitan water, and a philosophical treatise on the meaning of life, all delivered in a dialect that makes Italian sound like a foreign tongue. It’s an experience, alright. An experience I wouldn't trade for all the tea in China, provided, of course, I was properly medicated beforehand.
