Heidelberg! Ah, a town fit for a fairytale, or perhaps a brewer's convention, depending on which way you look at it. The castle, perched atop that confounded hill, is a sight to behold, a magnificent ruin that seems to have been designed by a committee of quarreling giants and then promptly struck by lightning for good measure. They say the French did it, the French always seem to be doing *something*, don't they? Anyway, there it stands, a romantic, crumbling testament to the folly of kings and the enduring power of gravity. One can almost imagine the knights of yore clanking about, although, truth be told, I suspect they spent most of their time polishing their armor and fretting about which duchess to woo.

The town itself, snuggled beneath the castle's shadow, is a delightful tangle of cobblestone streets and half-timbered houses, so picturesque it could curdle the milk of a cynic. Students swarm like bees around a honeypot, brimming with youthful exuberance and a healthy disregard for the hour. One can overhear snippets of philosophical debate and the off-key renditions of drinking songs, often intermingled with a great deal of laughter. I’ve observed them, these young scholars, spending more time arguing about the merits of various sausages than deciphering ancient texts; a pursuit, I confess, I can thoroughly understand. The Neckar River meanders serenely through the scene, reflecting the castle's silhouette and bearing the occasional tourist-laden boat, each one a miniature ark filled with hopeful pilgrims seeking a glimpse of German romance. And romance they find, or at least, a postcard-perfect illusion of it, easily obtained from any of the myriad shops selling cuckoo clocks and lederhosen. All in all, Heidelberg is a grand spectacle, a feast for the eyes and, if one is not careful, a dangerous drain on the wallet.
