Baden-Baden, they call it, twice over for emphasis, I reckon, just in case one forgets they’ve arrived at the very pinnacle of luxurious idleness. Land sakes, but it's a place fit to make a pauper forget his empty pockets and a king yearn for a bit of honest labor. The air itself seems perfumed with ease and the rustle of thousand-mark notes, a sound more commonly heard than the bleating of sheep, I assure you. I spotted a lady today, dressed finer than Solomon on a Sunday, leading a poodle with a jeweled collar that likely cost more than my entire wardrobe back in Eden—or rather, Missouri, since that Eden business is long behind me. One might think they've escaped the curse of work altogether, these pampered souls, but bless you, they’re working harder at leisure than I ever worked at anything, except, perhaps, trying to understand Adam's peculiar fascination with apples.

They gather at the Trinkhalle, these languid patrons of idleness, sipping mineral water that tastes suspiciously like lukewarm dishwater and trading gossip sweeter than any forbidden fruit. The men, all sporting moustaches that would make a walrus blush, discuss the latest horse race with the gravity of statesmen debating a declaration of war, while the women, bejeweled and befeathered, assess each other with a critical eye sharper than any serpent's tooth. The conversations, bless their hearts, are largely about who’s wearing what, who’s seeing whom, and who lost the most at the casino last night. It’s a veritable parade of vanity, a grand exhibition of elegant superfluity. And the Kurhaus, good heavens, the Kurhaus! A gilded cage if ever there was one, where fortunes are won and lost with the nonchalance of flipping a pancake. I saw one gentleman, looking glum enough to curdle milk, hand over a fistful of chips as if he were merely settling a trifling debt. A trifling debt! I dare say that “trifling” sum would have bought a small kingdom back home. But here, in Baden-Baden, it’s just another Tuesday, and another turn of the roulette wheel.
