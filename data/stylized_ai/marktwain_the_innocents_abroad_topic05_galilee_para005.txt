The Sea of Galilee, they call it, though “puddle” might be a more honest rendering. I’ve seen larger livestock watering holes back in Hannibal, Missouri, and with considerably less fuss made over them. It's a blue-ish, greenish, brownish thing, depending on the light and how recently a donkey decided to take a swim. They tell you the hills ring it 'round like a cup, but those hills are more like little mounds really, the sort a badger might generously call a mountain. Now, this lake, or puddle, or whatever you choose to label it, is purportedly the stage for many a biblical tale. Miracles aplenty, I hear! Why, they say a fellow walked on it once. Walked! I’d be more inclined to believe he was remarkably light and the water exceedingly shallow in that particular spot, or maybe he had a very buoyant donkey assisting him. These oriental folks, they do love their dramatic embellishments, I find. 

The villages skirting the sea, well, they're picturesque, I grant you that. Picturesque in the way a mangy dog is picturesque; you admire it from a distance and are profoundly grateful you don’t have to live with it. Cobbled streets that seem deliberately designed to trip a man up at every turn, houses stacked one atop the other like a drunkard’s precarious pile of playing cards, and the aroma, ah, the aroma! A potent brew of fish, donkey, and dust that could knock a buzzard off a fence post. And the fishermen! Heavens, those fishermen. A hardy lot, to be sure, tanned like well-worn leather and perpetually smelling of their trade. They cast their nets with the same solemnity a preacher uses when collecting tithes, though I suspect their motives are slightly less altruistic. All in all, Galilee is a sight to behold, a place where history and exaggeration mingle in a fashion that would make even the most seasoned yarn-spinner blush. Just don’t expect to find any grand canyons or sweeping vistas. You'll be sorely disappointed.
