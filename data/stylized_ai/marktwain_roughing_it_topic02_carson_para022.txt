Carson, ah, Carson. A town sprung up from dust and sagebrush like a stubborn weed, determined to make something of itself. They called it a city, mind you, and laid out streets as straight as a preacher's moral compass, though the sidewalks were more often inhabited by stray curs and tumbleweeds than actual respectable folk. It’s got ambitions, this Carson, you can see it in the way the silver ore is piled high like a miser’s dream, in the clatter of the stamp mills that drown out polite conversation for miles around, and in the sheer, unadulterated grit of the men who’d clawed their way across deserts and mountains, their pockets lined with more hope than actual coin, to find their fortune here.

You’d think with all that silver, the place would be dripping with opulence, but mostly it’s just dripping with dust and the sweat of honest, and not-so-honest, labor. The saloons, they’re plentiful as jackrabbits, and a man could drown his sorrows (or celebrate a stroke of luck) in whiskey cheaper than bottled water, which, come to think of it, is probably safer too. The hotels, well, they’re a sight to behold, constructed quicker than a gambler can lose his shirt, and about as structurally sound, I reckon. Sleepin’ in a tent might offer more stability.

Folks here, they're a mixed bag, a real potluck of humanity. You got your prospectors, eyes gleaming with greed and fueled by dreams of a Comstock Lode of their own. Then there's the lawyers, sharp as tacks and always sniffing around for a fight to profit from. And of course, the ladies, some with hearts of gold and others who’d sell you yours for a handful of chips. A feller could witness more drama on Carson Street in an afternoon than he’d see in a lifetime back East. It's a rough place, sure, but it's also got a certain charm, like a mangy dog with a wagging tail. It’s a place where a man can lose everything, or find everything he’s ever wanted, provided he’s got a bit of luck, a strong back, and maybe a concealed derringer for good measure. Whether it’ll amount to anything lasting, though, is anybody’s guess.
