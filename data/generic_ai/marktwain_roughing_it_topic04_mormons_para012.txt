The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormonism, originated in the United States during the 19th century with Joseph Smith Jr., who claimed to have received divine revelations that led to the translation of the Book of Mormon, a sacred text considered scripture alongside the Bible. Central to Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, the idea that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets, just as He did in biblical times. This belief differentiates them from many other Christian denominations that believe revelation ceased with the apostles. Early Mormon history was marked by persecution and westward migration, driven by conflicts arising from their unique doctrines and communal practices, eventually leading to the establishment of a strong presence in Utah.

Mormon theology includes familiar Christian concepts like Jesus Christ as the Savior and the importance of the Atonement, but also incorporates unique doctrines such as the premortal existence of souls, a three-tiered heaven, and the potential for individuals to become gods and goddesses in the afterlife through obedience to God's commandments and participation in temple ordinances. These ordinances, often performed vicariously for deceased ancestors, are considered essential for eternal salvation and exaltation. Mormon practice emphasizes strong family values, community involvement, and a strict moral code, often abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. Missionary work is a significant aspect of Mormon life, with young men and women often serving full-time missions for the church, proselytizing and providing service in communities around the world. The church's hierarchical structure is led by a President, considered a prophet, and his counselors, followed by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who oversee the worldwide church and its various programs. While the practice of polygamy was officially discontinued in 1890, it remains a sensitive part of their history, and some splinter groups continue the practice. The modern Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a global organization with millions of members, known for its humanitarian efforts, emphasis on education, and distinctive religious beliefs and practices.
