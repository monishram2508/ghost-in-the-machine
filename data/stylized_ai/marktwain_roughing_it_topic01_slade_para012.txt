Slade, now there's a settlement that’d make a buzzard think twice before circling. Situated, if you can call it that, in the very gullet of Nevada’s badlands, it's a collection of shacks and tents glued together by dust and desperation. I reckon the founding fathers, if Slade can boast such grandees, were either running from the law, running from their wives, or, more likely, running from themselves. Or perhaps they were just plain lost; I wouldn't put it past 'em. The water, what little they had, tasted like the devil's bathtub, and the only greenery was the occasional tumbleweed that dared to roll through, probably looking for a better place to die. I saw more card games happening at any given hour than I saw honest labor, though I’ll allow, defining “honest” in Slade could spark a philosophical debate that’d last longer than a claim dispute.

The inhabitants, well, they were a picture. Faces etched with hardship, eyes that had seen too much sun and too little civilization, and a general air of suspicion that could curdle milk at fifty paces. I swear, I saw a feller with a mustache so long it could have tripped a team of oxen, and another fellow who looked like he’d been pickled in whiskey since his birth. A generous description might call them "rugged individuals," but I leaned more towards "characters one would actively avoid in a dark alley, even if one was particularly fond of one's wallet." The main amusement seemed to consist of staring at newcomers, betting on how long they’d last, and then trying to sell them overpriced shovels for a gold mine that had been tapped out decades ago. The women, bless their grit, seemed to keep the whole infernal contraption from collapsing entirely. They patched up the holes in the shacks, cooked the questionable meals, and probably ran the card games on the sly, too. All in all, Slade was a fine example of the sort of place that makes a man appreciate a comfortable bed, a clean shirt, and the distinct lack of tumbleweeds in his coffee. It's the kind of spot that cures a fella of any lingering romantic notions about the Wild West, pronto.
