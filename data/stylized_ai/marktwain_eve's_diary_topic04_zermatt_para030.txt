Zermatt, they call it. A village snuggled up to the Matterhorn like a babe to its mother – albeit a mother made of granite and snow. And quite a mother she is, too, rearing her head with a haughty, uncaring grandeur that would make a Roman Emperor blush. One arrives, naturally, expecting to find the locals to be a hardy, sun-weathered lot, tanned like saddle leather and built like their sturdy little chalets. And, well, one does find that, eventually. But one also finds, piled high and thick as the snowdrifts, a veritable mountain of tourists. Pilgrims, I call them, come to worship at the altar of the Matterhorn. They arrive in droves, bundled in furs that would shame a bear, armed with cameras that look capable of photographing the very soul of a mountain, and speaking in tongues that would make the Tower of Babel seem like a hushed library.

The peculiar thing about Zermatt, you see, is the absence of the infernal combustion engine. Imagine, if you will, a place where the only sound is the gentle clinking of cowbells, the cheerful greetings of "Grüezi!" and the whirring of electric carts. One can almost hear oneself think! It's a most peculiar sensation, I assure you, after enduring the cacophony of modern life. The village itself is a charming jumble of wooden houses, stacked upon each other like a child's haphazard blocks, each overflowing with geraniums that seem determined to prove that beauty can flourish even at such an altitude. And the shops! Oh, the shops! Filled with cuckoo clocks that mock the passage of time, cowbells that assault the ears, and enough chocolate to send a dentist running for the hills. Yet, one finds oneself oddly drawn in, lured by the promise of a perfectly crafted trinket or a truly magnificent view. One leaves Zermatt both lighter in the pocket and heavier in the heart, with a memory etched as sharply as the silhouette of the Matterhorn against the azure sky. A place of contradictions, this Zermatt, but a place that, by Jove, manages to leave a mark.
