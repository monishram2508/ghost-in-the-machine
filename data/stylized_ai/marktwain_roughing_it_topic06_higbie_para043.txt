Now, Higbie. Higbie, they called him, a name fit for a pig rooting for truffles, not a man who fancied himself a prospector. Higbie was a feller, bless his cotton socks, that Providence seemed to have specifically designed for the purpose of providing amusement to those of us less afflicted with the mining fever than he. He’d come West, like the rest of us, with dreams of nuggets the size of hen's eggs dancing in his head, but Higbie’s dancing nuggets mostly turned out to be mica. He had a claim, a postage stamp of dirt up near Gold Hill, that he guarded with a ferocity that belied its utter worthlessness. You'd think it was the Comstock itself, the way he’d puff up and preen about it, chasing away any jackrabbit that dared hop across its boundary. He spent more time sharpening his pickaxe than actually swinging it, claiming he needed a “surgical instrument” to delicately unearth the treasure that was just, any minute now, about to reveal itself. And the stories he’d tell! About the ghosts of deceased prospectors guarding the mother lode, or the Indian curses upon those who dared defile the sacred ground with pick and shovel. He swore one time he saw a coyote wearing a prospector's hat, leading a pack of burros laden with gold bricks. Likely he'd just sampled too generously from his medicinal whiskey supply, which he claimed was strictly for warding off rheumatism but smelled suspiciously like watered-down rotgut. Truth be told, I suspect Higbie never found enough gold to buy a decent meal at the International Hotel, let alone strike it rich. But, confound it, he was good company. Always ready with a tall tale, a generous swig, and a cheerful delusion about the future. He reminded you that even when digging in dirt, you could find a nugget of humor in the fool's gold, and that, friend, was worth more than all the silver in Nevada.
