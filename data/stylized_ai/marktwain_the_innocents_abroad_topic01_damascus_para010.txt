Damascus, they call it the “Pearl of the Orient,” which sounds mighty fine and dandy, don’t it? But let me tell you, I’ve seen pearls, and I’ve seen Damascus, and while both have their charm, comparing the two is like comparing a mud fence to a soprano – there’s a connection there somewhere, maybe in the general vicinity of beauty, but not one that’d jump out and slap you in the face. Now, Damascus is old. Older than Methuselah’s left boot, likely. Folks say Cain built the place, but I reckon Cain was too busy brooding over his brother to bother with city planning. Still, it’s old, and that age clings to it like a persistent beggar, offering you stories for a handful of piastres. You wander down streets so narrow two fat men couldn’t pass abreast without scraping paint off the walls, and you can practically feel the ghosts of Saladin and those Crusader fellas jostling your elbow.

The bazaars, ah, those are a sight to behold. More colors than a rainbow after a particularly enthusiastic shower, more smells than a sultan’s spice cabinet, and more people crammed into a smaller space than you'd find in a sardine tin during a fire drill. You can buy anything in those bazaars, from a camel with a questionable limp to a carpet that's probably older than you are, and both, of course, at a price that's higher than the minaret of the Great Mosque. The merchants, bless their persuasive hearts, are a cunning bunch. They’ll swear up and down that that chipped teapot belonged to Cleopatra herself, and if you blink, you'll find yourself agreeing with them, and haggling furiously to shave off a few more pennies. And the food, well, the food is enough to make a grown man weep with joy. Mountains of hummus, kebabs sizzling with fragrant spices, pastries dripping with honey... It's a culinary adventure that'll expand your waistline and shrink your wallet, but it's worth every single pound and every last cent. Just be sure to bring your stomach and your bargaining skills, because in Damascus, both are essential tools of survival.
