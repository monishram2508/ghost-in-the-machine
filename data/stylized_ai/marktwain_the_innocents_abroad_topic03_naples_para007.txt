Ah, Naples! A city, mind you, that seems to have been assembled from spare parts collected after some celestial explosion of colors and chaos. One arrives expecting operatic vistas and finds, instead, a symphony of street vendors hawking wares one suspects were “liberated” from a neighboring nobleman’s estate only moments before. The very air hangs thick with the scent of frying something – could be seafood, could be an old shoe, one hesitates to inquire too closely – and the clamor! Lord, the clamor! Every Neapolitan possesses the lung capacity of a Pavarotti on steroids and the unwavering conviction that their own opinion, voiced at top volume, is the only one worth hearing. Carriages, or what passes for them these days, careen through the narrow, labyrinthine streets driven by imps with a penchant for near-death experiences. One suspects these fellows are related to the gods, who were notorious for dodging chariots on Mount Olympus, though their choice of vehicle has significantly decreased in elegance.

And the beggars! I’ve seen fewer mendicants attempting to relieve me of my coin during a political convention back in the States. They are an industrious lot, I grant you, with their practiced whimpers and elaborate sob stories, each more fantastical than the last. I swear one old woman told me she'd lost her leg to a particularly vicious limpet. A limpet, I ask you! One is tempted to admire their sheer audacity, even as one clutches one’s purse strings with the tenacity of a drowning sailor to a spar. Then there are the churches, each more bedecked with gold leaf and cherubs than the last. One could melt down the devotional ornaments in any one of those edifices and fund a small war, or perhaps just build a decent sewer system, which, I assure you, Naples could use. Yes, Naples is a hodgepodge, a glorious mess, a city that assaults the senses and leaves one utterly bewildered, but, confound it all, one finds oneself rather fond of the old rascal.
