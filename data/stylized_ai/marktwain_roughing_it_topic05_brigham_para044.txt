Brigham, ah, Brigham Young! A man of such enterprise, such *persuasion*, it’d make a Mississippi riverboat gambler blush. He led his flock across the plains like a celestial shepherd, only instead of green pastures, they found themselves in that… well, let’s call it *interesting* landscape of Salt Lake Valley. Now, some folks say he was a prophet, a visionary, divinely appointed. Others whisper that he was just a shrewd businessman with a silver tongue and an eye for real estate, a sort of Moses with a knack for irrigation. And let me tell you, irrigating that alkali desert took some doing; I reckon he could squeeze water from a stone, that Brigham. 

The stories they tell about him! Enough to fill a library, or at least a good-sized saloon. Some say he had wives aplenty, more than a feller could keep track of without a ledger and a legal secretary. Others say he was a stern but fair father, guiding his vast, sprawling family with an iron fist in a velvet glove – or maybe a velvet fist in an iron glove, depending on the day. He built a kingdom out of dust, that’s a fact. He laid down the law, dictated the rules, and, from what I hear, enforced them with a certain… *vigor*. Brigham wasn't one to brook dissent, mind you. He wanted things done his way, and by golly, they usually were. 

I remember one time, old man Hemlock told me – now Hemlock was a notorious liar, mind you, but the story’s still good – he said Brigham once stopped a swarm of locusts in their tracks just by glaring at them and bellowing, "Turn back, you damned grasshoppers! This here's a sacred valley, and you ain't welcome!" Hemlock swore those locusts turned tail and flew off in the other direction, scared half to death. Now, I don't believe a word of it, but it makes for a darn good yarn. Whether prophet or pragmatist, saint or scoundrel, Brigham was one hell of a character. He left his mark on that territory, that's for sure. And a good many other places, too, if you listen to the rumors. A man you couldn't ignore, even if you tried.
