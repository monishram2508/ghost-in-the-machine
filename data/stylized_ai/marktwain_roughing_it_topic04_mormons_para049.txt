Well, I spent a spell out in Utah, and saw more Mormons than jackrabbits on a dusty morning. A peculiar bunch, they are, though not half as outlandish as some claim. Polygamy, you hear tell, is their stock-in-trade, though the feller I bunked with—a kindly old gent named Jedediah—only had the one wife, and she looked perpetually vexed enough for three. Said he, with a wink, that the Lord hadn’t seen fit to bestow upon him the stamina required for more than one. Now, you hear stories of 'em all wearing beards and somber clothes and speaking in tongues, but I saw fellers in dungarees and calico shirts just like anybody else. They just held a particular fervor for scripture, and a hankering for keeping themselves to themselves. Their temples were spectacles to behold, all gleaming white and looking like some grand palace dropped clean out of the heavens. I was never invited in, mind you – something about needing a “recommend” I didn't possess.

They were industrious sorts, I'll grant them that. Every hand seemed to be plowing fields and building canals and making the desert bloom like a prize-winning rosebush. They had a system, a cooperative bent that would make a socialist blush. Of course, that also meant they kept a tight grip on their community, and a stranger felt like a fly in a pitcher of molasses. Still, they always offered a cup of cool water and a kind word, even if they did look at you sideways like you were a particularly mangy coyote that might steal their chickens. They talked of a "Zion," a city on a hill, and darned if they weren't trying to build it, brick by blessed brick. Whether it was a righteous utopia or a gilded cage, well, that's a matter for the theologians to wrangle over. I'm just a rambler, passing through, observing the oddities of human nature, and finding the humor in even the most sanctimonious of situations. And I tell you what, those Mormons provided enough grist for my storytelling mill to keep it churning for a good long while.
