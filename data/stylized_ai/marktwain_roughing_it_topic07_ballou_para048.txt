Ballou, you see, was a specimen. Not exactly a specimen of what, I couldn't rightly say, but a specimen nonetheless. A man so perpetually optimistic, he could find a silver lining in a thundercloud full of snakes. He was about as useful as a screen door on a submarine when it came to serious business, always flitting about like a hummingbird with a sugar addiction, convinced he was contributing mightily. Claimed he had a "head for figures," Ballou did, though I suspect he was confusing figures with the number of times he'd been bamboozled by a two-bit card sharp. He’d lose his shirt on a hand of euchre, then declare he'd "invested" in the game, anticipating a future windfall.

And his ideas! Lord have mercy, they were a sight to behold. One time, he decided we could corner the market on tumbleweeds, figuring the Eastern fellas would pay handsomely for a taste of the wild west. We spent a week chasing those thorny devils across the desert, him practically glowing with entrepreneurial zeal, only to discover nobody back East gave a hoot about tumbleweeds, and we were stuck with a wagon full of prickly kindling. He didn't let that deter him, though. Just shrugged it off, declared it a "valuable learning experience," and moved on to his next harebrained scheme, something involving trained grasshoppers and miniature circuses, if I recall correctly.

Despite being a walking, talking repository of bad decisions, you couldn't help but like the fella. He was honest as the day is long, even if his honesty was often delivered with a healthy dose of naivete. Always willing to lend a hand, even if that hand was invariably followed by an even bigger blunder. Ballou, you see, was a good-hearted fool, and in a world full of cynical sharps, sometimes, just sometimes, a good-hearted fool is exactly what a man needs. Though I wouldn't trust him to hold onto my pocket watch, mind you. Not unless I had a spare, and a strong aversion to money.
