Now, Damascus, bless its ancient heart, is a place that makes a fella feel like he's stepped right into one of those old biblical picture books, only with more dust and donkeys, naturally. Why, they claim it’s the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, which sounds impressive enough, though I suspect a goodly portion of those inhabitants have been asleep for a considerable amount of that time, judging by the pace of things. You see a fellow riding a donkey that, I swear, looked older than Methuselah, and you half expect him to pull a clay tablet out of his pocket and start dictating some legal document from the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. 

The streets themselves are a tangled mess of narrow alleys, twisting and turning like a politician trying to explain his latest flip-flop. You think you’re headed one direction, and suddenly you’re staring face-to-face with a camel chewing its cud, or tripping over a pile of carpets that would make Aladdin green with envy. And the smells! Good gracious, the smells. Incense and spices, jasmine and sewage, roasting lamb and something I suspect came from a particularly unfortunate encounter between a stray cat and a Damascus cart. A regular olfactory symphony, it is, only sometimes it leans a bit more towards the minor key, if you catch my drift.

But don’t let me paint it as a purely comical affair, mind you. There's a certain… dignity to the place, a weight of history that settles on you like a heavy cloak. You see the ancient walls, scarred by time and conquest, and you can almost hear the echoes of Roman legions marching, Umayyad caliphs holding court, and crusaders… well, probably complaining about the dust and the smells. The people, despite the hardships they've endured, retain a certain stoic grace. They’ll haggle with you over the price of a rug with the tenacity of a lawyer arguing a case, but they’ll also offer you a cup of sweet, strong coffee with a smile that could melt the polar ice cap. Damascus, you see, is a city of contradictions, a chaotic, charming, confounding old relic that somehow manages to keep breathing, even when it seems like it should have given up the ghost centuries ago. And that, my friends, is something worth seeing, even if you do need to pack a strong stomach and a good pair of walking shoes.
