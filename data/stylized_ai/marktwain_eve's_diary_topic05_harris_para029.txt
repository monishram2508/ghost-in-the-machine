Harris, now there's a specimen ripe for dissecting, though I wouldn't trouble myself with a scalpel; a dull butter knife would suffice, considering the depth of his enigma, which isn't saying much. He's the kind of fella who could stand knee-deep in the Mississippi during a flood, claim it's just a bit of dampness, and then proceed to offer you advice on how to avoid getting your britches wet. His wisdom, you see, flows with the same reckless abandon as that river, often leading to the same destination: disaster. Why, I recall one time, down in Hannibal, he tried his hand at selling lightning rods. Now, I admire ambition, but Harris convincing the parsonage to invest in such contraptions during a drought that had cracked the earth like a dry biscuit was audacity of a magnitude usually reserved for politicians and travelling dentists. Of course, a month later, a rogue thunderstorm rolled through, fried the parson's prize-winning petunias, and gave the Reverend such a fright he swore off sermons on the end times. Harris, naturally, took credit for the lightning rod's "efficacy," claiming it had successfully attracted all the electricity to one place. A man of singular talent, he is, for seeing the silver lining in a cloud so black it could curdle milk. He’s also got a memory that rivals an elephant’s, though I suspect the elephant’s memory is probably more selective. Harris remembers every slight, every perceived offense, every time you borrowed his pocketknife and failed to return it sharpened, but conveniently forgets the three times he borrowed your fishing pole and came back with nary a nibble and a tall tale about a leviathan that snapped the line. Yes, Harris is a walking contradiction, a paradox wrapped in a flannel shirt, a man who proves, beyond all doubt, that common sense is a far rarer commodity than gold.
