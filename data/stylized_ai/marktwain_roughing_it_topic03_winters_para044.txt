Winter, she's a painted hussy, all glitter and ice, a real looker at a distance, but get close and you'll find she's got a heart colder than a banker’s smile. Why, just the other day, Old Man Hemlock swore he saw a jackrabbit freeze mid-leap, its ears stuck straight up like a couple of frosted bayonets. I ain't vouchin' for the truth of that, mind you, Hemlock also claims he wrestles grizzly bears on Tuesdays, but the point stands: winter ain’t playing patty-cake. You think summer’s tough with her heat and her bugs and her relentless enthusiasm for growth? Winter’s got apathy down to an art. She just sits there, draped in white, not caring a fig whether you got firewood or not. 

Then there’s the wind. Now, I’ve known some talkative women in my time, but the winter wind, she takes the prize. She'll howl all night long, telling tall tales about the North Pole and disgruntled polar bears, rattling your windows till you think the whole cabin’s about to fly off to Alaska. And the snow! Folks 'round these parts talk about "picturesque landscapes" and "pristine blankets" but I reckon they ain't shoveled a foot of it. It’s heavy, wet stuff, the kind that clings to your boots like a lovesick mule. And then, just when you think you've cleared a decent path, boom! Another blizzard comes along and lays another foot or two, just to prove who's boss. Makes a man question his life choices, I tell you. Though, come to think of it, anything less engaging than staring down a shovelful of snow is just about guaranteed to make a man contemplate the absurdity of his brief stint on this mortal coil. Still, there's a certain beauty to it all, I suppose. A grim, unforgiving beauty, like a loan shark with a winning smile, but beauty nonetheless. Makes a man appreciate a good fire and a stiff drink, that's for sure.
