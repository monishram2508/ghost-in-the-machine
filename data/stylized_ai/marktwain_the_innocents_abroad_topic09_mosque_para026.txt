Now, concerning this mosque, this edifice dedicated to somethin' called Islam, well, I reckon I’ve seen grander things built for lesser purposes – say, a doghouse fit for a pampered poodle or a monument dedicated to the memory of a particularly dull politician. But there’s a certain curiousity that clings to these places, a quiet dignity that’s hard to shake off, like a persistent fly in the summer heat. You see ‘em sprinkled across the lands, domes a-gleamin' in the sun, minarets reachin' for the heavens as if tryin' to flag down a stray angel.

Inside, it’s usually a vast expanse of carpet, soft underfoot, mind you, enough to make a fella want to take a nap right then and there. All that fancy geometric work on the walls, patterns repeatin’ and intertwining, enough to give a fella a headache if he stares too long. I reckon it’s meant to represent somethin’ profound, somethin’ beyond my simple understandin', maybe the infinite nature of somethin' or other. They got fancy lamps hangin’ like jeweled spiders, castin’ these dramatic shadows across the whole shebang. And then, of course, there’s the call to prayer – a fella standing in one of those minarets, singin’ out in a voice that could wake the dead. It’s a peculiar sound, no doubt, a sort of mournful wail, but I can't rightly say I've not enjoyed the change of pace it'd be from those church bells.

I must say, even if you don’t hold with the whole Allah business, you can’t deny the artistry that goes into these places. They’re built to inspire awe, to make a fella feel small and insignificant, which, when you think about it, ain’t a bad thing now and again. It makes you reconsider your place in the grand scheme of things. The place itself might not convert a soul, but the quiet reflection it offers might just allow them to consider a thing or two. And considerin', as any good thinking man knows, is about as good as learnin', maybe even better.
