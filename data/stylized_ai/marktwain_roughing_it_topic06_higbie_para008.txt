Higbie, now there's a name that sounds like a mining town, doesn't it? Truth be told, it might as well have been, judging by the sorry spectacle that greeted us upon arrival. A collection of shacks thrown together with the haphazardness of a drunkard building a house of cards – only these shacks were flimsier and the drunkard probably had a steadier hand. Higbie wasn't so much a town as a pause in the landscape, a place where the sagebrush decided to take a break from spreading and the jackrabbits convened to discuss the merits of dust versus more dust. The inhabitants, God bless 'em, were a curious lot. They seemed to have aged ten years for every year they'd spent breathing the Higbie air, which smelled remarkably like unwashed socks and ambition left to rot. 

There was old man Peabody, who claimed to have discovered a silver mine so rich it'd make Croesus blush, but then he'd wander off mid-sentence to argue with a particularly stubborn sage hen, leaving you to wonder if the mine existed solely in his addled mind. Then there was Mrs. Grimshaw, a woman whose voice could curdle milk at fifty paces, and whose husband, I suspect, spent most of his time pretending to be deaf. They ran the "hotel," which consisted of three rooms, each furnished with a bed that seemed to have been assembled from the spare parts of a broken down wagon. I swear, I saw a family of mice moving out of one of those mattresses with little trunks, complaining about the accommodations. 

But I digress. Higbie had a certain… charm, in the same way a rattlesnake has charm. It was a raw, untamed place, a monument to human resilience (or perhaps human stubbornness), and it offered the kind of scenery that could make a man weep with joy or despair, depending on whether he'd just struck gold or lost his last dollar in a poker game with a one-eyed desperado named "Fingers" Malone. Higbie, you see, was a gamble – a gamble with the land, with fortune, and with your sanity. And whether you won or lost, you’d walk away with a story to tell, even if that story was just about the time you spent sharing a room with a family of disgruntled mice.
