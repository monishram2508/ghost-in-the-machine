Well, I spent a spell out in Utah Territory amongst the Mormons, a peculiar bunch, I tell you what. You’d think a fella would be able to keep a straight face watching a cat chase its tail, but try keeping one around Brigham Young’s tabernacle! It's like watching a whole swarm of cats all chasing their own tails, simultaneously, and all believing they're actually catching something of immense importance. Polygamy was all the rage, you see, and a man could have wives enough to populate a small village, though how he remembered their names – let alone what each one wanted for supper – was a mystery that even Sherlock Holmes couldn’t crack, I wager. They were industrious sorts, though, these Mormons. They’d turned that arid desert into a blooming garden, all thanks to hard work, irrigation, and a faith as strong as a mule’s kick. They believed every word in that Book of Mormon, written, as they claimed, by golden plates unearthed by a fella named Joseph Smith. Now, I’m not one to argue religion, but if a man tells me he translated ancient texts from gold tablets with the help of a hat and a seer stone, I'm allowed a raised eyebrow, ain’t I? Course, I ain’t saying they were pulling the wool over anyone’s eyes, mind you. Some folks believe the moon is made of cheese, and there ain’t no accounting for taste. The whole affair had a certain, well, let’s just call it “charm.” A fellow could sit on a porch, sipping lemonade, watching a dozen wives hanging laundry, all singing hymns, and it’d be odd, but oddly peaceful too. Like a well-ordered ant colony, only with more petticoats and a whole lot more children. I never quite figured them out, but I’ll say this: they were hospitable, generous, and about as predictable as a Nevada thunderstorm. And that, my friend, is saying something.
