Chamonix! A place so determined to be close to the heavens, it has, without a doubt, shoved the Alps themselves skyward with a grit that would make even the most hardened mule jealous. I tell you, Madam, it’s a town built upon a dare, a challenge flung at nature itself, and nature, bless her wild heart, has answered with glaciers gleaming like a miser’s hoard and peaks so sharp they could shave the beard off Father Time. One arrives, luggage in tow, expecting quaint chalets and wholesome yodeling, only to be confronted with a landscape so aggressively majestic it feels almost vulgar. Vulgar, I say! Like a countess in a burlap sack, utterly out of place.

The locals, bless their hardy souls, seem entirely unperturbed by this cosmic drama unfolding in their backyards. They go about their business, selling postcards of snowy peaks (which, let me tell you, are far less intimidating on glossy paper) and polishing skis with the stoicism of men who’ve stared death in the face and found him slightly boring. And the tourists! Heavens to Betsy, the tourists! They arrive, bundled in layers of fashionable, yet utterly impractical, fleece, determined to “conquer” Mont Blanc with the aid of cleverly engineered boots and a profound lack of understanding of altitude sickness. They pose for photographs, looking utterly bewildered against the backdrop of existential grandeur, and then retreat to cafes to sip hot chocolate and discuss the merits of thermal underwear. It's a spectacle, Madam, a true spectacle, like watching a troop of penguins attempting to waltz. One wonders, truly, if they realize they are standing at the foot of a giant, or if they merely think they've stumbled upon a particularly scenic confectioner's shop. It’s all rather breathtaking, in both the literal and metaphorical sense, I assure you. Though I wouldn’t recommend attempting any serious climbing after a hearty cheese fondue. A mistake, I can tell you, I learned the hard way.
