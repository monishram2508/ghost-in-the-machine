Now, concerning these Mosques, or “places of prostration” as they are grandly called by the faithful, I reckon they're curious affairs, deserving of a bit of examination. You see ‘em sprinkled across the land, looking for all the world like someone’s accidentally dropped a stack of fancy teacups, each one topped with a precarious minaret that seems forever on the verge of toppling over like a drunken sailor in a high wind. Inside, you won’t find pews, mind you, not a single one. Makes a man wonder if they think standing's the only way to stay awake during sermons, which, if my experiences with the Reverend Higgins are any guide, might not be such a bad notion.

The floors are often covered in carpets finer than anything you’d find in a Congressman's office, all arranged with geometrical patterns that seem designed to hypnotize you into pious submission. And bless your heart, if you dare tread on them with your shoes on! Why, you'd think you’d committed some unspeakable crime. Instead, you must shed your footwear at the door, creating a mountain of mismatched boots and slippers that'd make a pawnbroker blush. I once saw a portly gentleman, after a particularly vigorous prayer, spend a good ten minutes searching for his left brogue, only to discover it perched atop the minaret shoe pile, looking for all the world like it was contemplating its own mortality.

Then there are the ablutions. Before entering, the devout must wash their hands, face, and feet. A commendable practice, mind you, especially if you’ve just spent the morning mucking out the stables. But it always strikes me as a bit peculiar that one must be clean on the outside to commune with the Almighty, when it's often the inside that's in need of a good scrubbing. Still, who am I to question the wisdom of the ages? Perhaps a clean exterior is a good starting point for a thorough spiritual overhaul. And one thing’s for certain, after observing the rituals within those walls, you'll be left with the distinct impression that piety, much like a good game of poker, requires a certain amount of dedication, a bit of luck, and a very comfortable pair of slippers.
