Now, this Coliseum, bless its old, crumbling heart, is a sight, I tell you, a regular three-ring circus of history and decay. You stand there, squinting against the Roman sun which hasn't improved a whit in the two thousand years since it last witnessed a man get eaten by a lion, and you try to imagine the roar of the crowd, the clanging of swords, the general unpleasantness of watching somebody’s innards become somebody else's supper. It’s a noble effort, I grant you, but about as easy as imagining a politician keeping a promise. The tourists flock to it like moths to a particularly dusty flame, snapping pictures with their infernal contraptions, all trying to capture the glory that’s mostly worn off like cheap paint on a chariot. You can practically hear them thinking, "My goodness, a large pile of rocks! I must have a souvenir!" And the guides, bless their long-suffering souls, drone on about gladiators and emperors and all manner of historical hooey, much of it, I suspect, invented whole cloth. They'll tell you tales of bravery and honor, of men fighting for freedom and glory, but I reckon it was mostly a matter of staying alive long enough to see another sunrise, which, in that line of work, was a rare and precious commodity. The place is positively crawling with cats, too, fat, contented felines who’ve clearly made a better go of living in the ruins than any gladiator ever did. They lounge about, basking in the sun, looking down their aristocratic noses at the tourists, likely thinking, "Humans, always making a fuss about the past when there's a perfectly good sunbeam to nap in." And you can't really blame them, can you? All in all, the Coliseum is a grand spectacle, a bit like a toothless old lion showing off his faded mane. It may not be quite what it used to be, but it's still quite a show, provided you don't mind a little dust, a few overpriced souvenirs, and the distinct possibility of being photobombed by a particularly regal Roman cat.
