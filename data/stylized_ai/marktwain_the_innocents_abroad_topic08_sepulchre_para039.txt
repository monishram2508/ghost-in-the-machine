Now, a sepulchre, you understand, ain’t just a hole in the ground with a headstone stuck in it like a lollipop in a mud pie. No sir, a proper sepulchre is a statement, a monument to the departed, and generally, a monument to the ego of those left behind to do the monumenting. I reckon if the deceased could see the contraption being erected over their remains, they’d likely roll over in their... well, in their dirt nap, and cuss a blue streak, especially if they were tight-fisted in life. I've seen sepulchres grander than some folks' homes, carved from marble that likely cost more than the deceased ever earned hauling lumber or swindling widows. Makes a man wonder if they're trying to impress the worms, or maybe convince Saint Peter that ol' Silas there was actually an upstanding citizen, despite the ledger full of questionable debts he conveniently forgot to settle.

Then you got the inscriptions, bless their hearts. Always overflowing with flowery language and pronouncements of virtues that the departed probably only possessed for about five minutes before expiring. “A loving husband, devoted father, and pillar of the community.” Balderdash! More likely a man who yelled at the dog, forgot his anniversary, and spent half his days avoiding the tax collector. But you ain't gonna put that on the tombstone, are you? Heavens no! That wouldn’t do at all. You gotta paint a picture of perfection, even if it’s so far from the truth it needs a telescope to even glimpse its neighborhood. And the angels! Lord have mercy on the angels. Always perched atop these things, looking bored and vaguely irritated, probably wishing they were back in heaven sipping ambrosia instead of guarding the bones of someone who cheated at poker. All in all, a sepulchre is a curious thing, a blend of grief, vanity, and a healthy dose of storytelling, with the deceased serving as the unwitting star of a play they didn't even audition for.
