Slade, that alkali hellhole masquerading as a stage stop – well, it was a spectacle, I reckon, akin to watching a coyote try to learn the waltz. A cluster of shanties clinging to the barren Nevada landscape like ticks on a stray dog, each more dilapidated than the last. Dust devils danced through the unpaved streets, mocking any pretense of cleanliness, and the sun beat down with the unforgiving intensity of a preacher condemning sin. The inhabitants, bless their cotton socks (though likely they wore none), seemed to have been sculpted by hardship and seasoned with disappointment. I saw one fellow, face etched with more lines than a topographical map, trying to sell a mule that looked like it had lost a wrestling match with a steam engine. He claimed it was "spirited," which I took to mean it would buck you clean into next Tuesday. The saloon, "The Gilded Nugget" (more rust than gilding, mind you), served a beverage they called whiskey, though I suspected it was closer to diluted turpentine. The barkeep, a burly gentleman with a handlebar mustache that could rival a bull's horns, seemed perpetually engaged in a silent staring contest with the back of the bar. Gamblers sat hunched over tables, their faces illuminated by flickering lamps, playing cards with a ferocity that suggested they were vying for the last piece of dry land after the flood. The music, provided by a mournful piano that sounded suspiciously out of tune, was enough to drive a sane man to madness – or at least to strong drink. And the air, Lord, the air! A concoction of dust, sweat, cheap perfume, and the lingering aroma of something dead and forgotten, clinging to the lungs like a persistent cough. Yes, Slade. A place so dreadful it would make a buzzard think twice before settling down. A place so utterly unforgettable, I'd sooner forget my own birthday. And yet, there was a certain...charm to it all, like a toothache that reminds you you're still alive.
