Lucerne, bless its heart, is a town that fancies itself a proper spectacle, like a peacock convinced its tail feathers single-handedly invented beauty. They’ve got this lake, see, a swathe of water so stubbornly blue it almost insults the rest of nature for not keeping up. Then they've thrown mountains around it like someone carelessly scattered a handful of lumpy green potatoes, making it quite picturesque, I suppose, if you’re the sort who gets easily impressed by scenery. I suspect the Swiss invented the postcard specifically to show off Lucerne, a blatant attempt to shame the rest of the world's landscapes. The burghers stroll along the lakefront with an air of serene self-satisfaction, like they personally negotiated the contract with the Almighty for this prime real estate. And the Chapel Bridge, oh, the Chapel Bridge! A covered walkway, mind you, and ancient, yes, which gives the tour guides a field day droning on about history. Trouble is, half the paintings inside are so faded you can barely tell a saint from a particularly glum cow. Still, tourists flock to it like pigeons to a dropped crust, snapping pictures as if photographic evidence will somehow validate their existence. You can hardly move for the sheer number of parasols and guidebooks. And the lions! Don’t get me started on the dying lion. It’s carved into a rock face, supposedly to commemorate some Swiss Guards who met an unfortunate end in Paris. Now, I'm no sculptor, but if I were going to immortalize heroism, I wouldn’t choose a creature that looks like it just stubbed its toe and is contemplating a lawsuit. It's pathetic, really, and yet people weep over it. Lucerne is like that though; a masterful performance in the art of subtle exaggeration. It convinces you that everything is perfectly perfect, even when a closer inspection reveals it’s just ever-so-slightly… *much*.
