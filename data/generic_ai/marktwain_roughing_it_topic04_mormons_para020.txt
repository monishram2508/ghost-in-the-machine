The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a distinct Christian denomination with a rich history and unique theological framework. Emerging in the United States during the 19th century, the church was founded by Joseph Smith, who claimed to have received visitations from God and Jesus Christ, as well as angelic visitations, leading to the translation of the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible. This book, narrating the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who received visitations from Jesus Christ after his ascension, distinguishes the Latter-day Saints from traditional Protestant and Catholic doctrines. Central to their faith is the belief in continuing revelation, asserting that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets in modern times, guiding the church's development and doctrine. Mormon theology emphasizes the potential for individuals to progress towards godhood, a concept known as exaltation, achieved through adherence to gospel principles, temple ordinances, and righteous living. These ordinances, performed in dedicated temples, are viewed as essential for salvation and include baptism for the dead, vicarious endowments, and celestial marriage, which binds families together for eternity.

The church's structure is hierarchical, led by a president and a council of twelve apostles who oversee global operations. Missionary service is a significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young adults, typically in their late teens and early twenties, dedicating 18-24 months to serving missions around the world, proselytizing and engaging in community service. Mormons are generally known for their strong family values, emphasis on education, and adherence to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which promotes healthy living through abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs, as well as advocating for a balanced diet. The church has faced historical controversies, particularly concerning the practice of polygamy in the 19th century, which was officially discontinued in 1890. Despite these challenges, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown significantly, becoming a global religion with millions of members worldwide and continues to actively engage in humanitarian efforts and interfaith dialogue.
