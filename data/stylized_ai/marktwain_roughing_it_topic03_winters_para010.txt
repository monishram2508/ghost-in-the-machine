Winters in Nevada, bless their ornery little hearts, were a spectacle rivaled only by a drunk prospector tryin' to pan for gold in a muddy puddle. They weren't the polite, well-mannered winters you'd find back East, draped in a charming blanket of snow, whispered about by poets and painters. No, sir, these were brawling, cantankerous affairs, full of bluster and icy shoves. The wind, a coyote with a mean streak and a set of teeth sharper than a gambler's conscience, howled down from the Sierras, carrying with it snowflakes that felt less like delicate beauty and more like tiny, frozen buckshot. You could swear it was personally tryin' to peel the hide off your face, and if you listened closely, you'd hear it chuckling about its success. 

The sagebrush, usually a stoic, dusty green, huddled together, looking miserable and contemplating a mass suicide. The ground hardened up something fierce, so tough you could break a pickaxe on it, let alone hope to dig up a fool's fortune. Everything shrunk and shivered. The creeks became sluggish ribbons of ice, and even the whiskey seemed to lose some of its warmth – though that might have just been the general feeling of impending doom permeating the air. Now, some folks might tell you about the pristine beauty of a snow-covered landscape, and the peaceful quiet that descends upon the world. But those folks, I reckon, never had to trudge through knee-deep drifts to chop firewood, or wake up to find their water bucket frozen solid enough to chip away at with a hammer. There was beauty to be found, I suppose, the same way there’s beauty in watchin' a dog chase its tail – a simple, fleeting amusement amidst the general lunacy of it all. But mostly, winter in Nevada was a test of endurance, a trial by cold and wind, designed to weed out the faint of heart and leave behind only the truly stubborn, the ones who figured they had too much cussedness to die easy. And truth be told, I wouldn’t have had it any other way. At least it made for good stories later, told 'round a crackling fire, with a healthy swig of something that burned a little hotter than the winter wind.
