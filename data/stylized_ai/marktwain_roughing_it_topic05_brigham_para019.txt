Brigham, ah, Brigham Young. Now there was a man cut from a different bolt of cloth altogether, a cloth likely woven from sagebrush and strong convictions, with a dash of shrewdness thrown in for good measure. I reckon any feller who can wrangle a whole passel of folks across a desert drier than a preacher’s wit after a lengthy sermon, and plant ‘em down smack-dab in the middle of nowhere to build a city, deserves a good hard look. Folks say he was a prophet, seer, and revelator – and who am I to argue? I ain’t got the stomach for arguing with a fella who commands an army of wives, nor the gall to dispute the pronouncements of a man who seemingly talked turkey with the Almighty Himself. Salt Lake City, that's his monument, rising there out of the salt flats like a mirage or a grand joke. The man was a builder, mind you, not just of temples and tabernacles, but of empires, both spiritual and earthly. He had a way of bending stubborn landscapes and even more stubborn people to his will. And let me tell you, dealing with human nature is a tougher proposition than hauling water uphill with a leaky bucket. He preached industry and temperance, although he wasn’t exactly a teetotaler himself, if the stories are to be believed. I always found that a comforting inconsistency. Made him seem more human, like the rest of us sinners. He was a practical man, too, that Brigham. He knew that faith alone wouldn’t fill a belly, so he set his folks to irrigating and plowing, making that desert blossom like a rose – or at least a hardy desert flower, which is about as close to romance as you get in those parts. Some called him a tyrant, some called him a saint. Me? I figure he was just a man, a right peculiar one at that, doing what he thought needed doing in a country where the rules were still being written in dust and desperation. And you know what? He did it, by thunder.
