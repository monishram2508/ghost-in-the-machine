 Pard? Well, now, that's a word you don't often hear whistled on the breeze of polite society, though I reckon I've heard it barked more than a hound dog chasing a rabbit in these here Nevada territories. A "pard," you see, is like to bein' hitched to a burro with a particularly stubborn streak. You're in it together, for better or worse, usually worse, seein' as how fortune's a fickle jade out here. He's your comrade in arms, your sharer of beans, your witness when you stumble over a rattlesnake in the dark and let out a holler fit to wake the dead. But don't go mistaking him for a saint, mind you. A pard is just as likely to swipe the last biscuit when your back's turned as he is to pull you from a flooded creek.

Take my old pard, Jedediah, bless his hide. Claimed he could smell gold a mile off, could practically taste it in the wind. Turns out, all he could smell was his own unwashed socks and all he could taste was dust and disappointment. We chased fool's gold across half the state, dug more holes than a prairie dog town, and all we ever found was enough rock to build a decent chicken coop. He was a card, that Jedediah, always had a tall tale brewing on his tongue and a twinkle in his eye that could charm a rattlesnake into knitting booties. He also had a knack for losing our provisions, a talent that made a man contemplate the relative merits of cannibalism, though mostly just in jest, of course. But even when we were down to our last crust of bread and the sun was beatin' down like a blacksmith's hammer, Jedediah would find a way to crack a joke or spin a yarn that made you forget your empty belly. That’s a pard for you. A right bothersome, exasperating, unreliable, but ultimately irreplaceable pain in the neck. You might curse him six ways to Sunday, but you'd still gladly share your last drop of water with him. Just keep a close eye on that last biscuit, though, and maybe double-knot your shoelaces, just in case.
