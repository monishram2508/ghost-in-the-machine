Higbie, now there's a specimen to conjure with, a genuine article if ever I saw one. He was built like a brick outhouse, square and solid, though I suspicioned he'd seen more saloon floors than bricks in his day. Claimed to be a miner, he did, but I reckon his mining consisted more of excavating bottles and panning for loose change in the poker games at the back of the Long Branch. Higbie boasted about finding the Mother Lode, naturally, every miner did back then, each nugget a size of a hen's egg and pure, unadulterated gold, of course. But his Mother Lode seemed perpetually tucked away in some far-off canyon, always a day's journey away, always just beyond the next bend in the river. A fella could practically taste the dust of that phantom claim, it was invoked so often. He dressed like he'd been attacked by a travelling haberdasher and lost, a collection of mismatched garments that seemed to actively fight each other for attention. A waistcoat that strained against its buttons, a hat that looked like it had weathered a small war, and boots that probably knew the location of more than one unmarked grave – a veritable symphony of sartorial misfortune. Higbie was a font of tall tales, each one taller than the last, and he delivered them with such a straight face, a body might just be fooled if he didn't know better. He'd tell you about grizzly bears the size of stagecoaches, Indians who could read the minds of mules, and storms that could turn a river upside down, all with the conviction of a preacher delivering a sermon on a Sunday morn. And yet, you couldn't help but like the old coot. He was a harmless enough rogue, just trying to scrape by and keep a smile on his face in a land where smiles were harder to come by than water in a drought. He may have been full of wind, like a broken bellows, but he was a wind that kept things lively, a bit of color in a landscape painted mostly in shades of brown and gray.
