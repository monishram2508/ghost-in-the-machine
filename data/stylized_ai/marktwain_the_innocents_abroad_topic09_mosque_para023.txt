Now, concerning this edifice they call a mosque, well, it's a sight to behold, though not in the way a Mississippi steamboat is a sight, mind you. No calliopes involved, and precious little in the way of gambling, unless you count the devout wagering their eternal souls. I reckon the first thing that strikes a fella is the sheer lack of pew advertisements. Imagine that! No Dr. Quackenbush's Liver Pills plastered on the back of every other bench, or announcements for the upcoming Temperance Revival. A distinct improvement, I say.

Then there's the matter of ornamentation. Instead of cherubs and angels gazing down with that perpetually perplexed look, you've got these geometric doodads sprawling across the walls like a spider on a caffeine binge. Very intricate, very perplexing to a simple man like myself, though I suppose it keeps the mind occupied whilst waiting for the… well, I ain’t precisely sure what they're waiting for. Prayers, I gather. Lots of bowing and scraping too. More bowing and scraping, in fact, than a politician during election season. One could develop a serious case of back trouble from all that genuflecting, I imagine.

They’ve got these fellas up front, chanting and hollering in a language that sounds suspiciously like a cat fight in a back alley – although, to be fair, I haven't spent an awful lot of time attending cat fights. Still, it's all very theatrical, I must admit. And the carpets! My stars, the carpets are thicker than a banker's skull and more elaborately patterned than a Mississippi gambler's vest. One could easily get lost in the labyrinthine designs, and probably find a lost dime or two as well, if one were so inclined. All in all, a curious place, the mosque. Not quite as entertaining as a good minstrel show, perhaps, but certainly more aesthetically pleasing than a hog-rendering plant, and probably safer too.
