Well, then, let’s talk about glaciers. A glacier, my dear, is what you might call a river of ice, though calling it a river suggests a certain…promptness, which is frankly, a slander against the glacial condition. It moves, yes, but at a speed that would make a snail blush with mortification. Why, I swear I saw a petrified forest overtake one in the time it took me to explain the difference between a freshet and a fjord to Adam. Speaking of Adam, he was ever impressed by size, so I suppose he'd approve of the sheer tonnage of these icy behemoths. They’re truly enormous, these glaciers, pressing down upon the earth with such force that they carve valleys deeper than my curiosity for whatever mischief that snake was planning next. It's the earth's own, slow-motion sculpting project.

You see them up there in the mountainous regions, glittering like a queen's jewels on a sunny morning, though considerably less accessible and less likely to be given away as a wedding present. And all that lovely, compressed snow, layers upon layers piled up over centuries, turned into this glorious, grinding, geological force! It’s a bit like compressing all the gossip of a century into a single, dense, impenetrable truth. Except, of course, the glacier will eventually melt and reveal its secrets in the form of floods and newly carved landscapes. Which is rather more dramatic than Mrs. Grundy revealing that Mrs. Higgins once eloped with the butcher. But I digress. These cold, silent giants, they remind me of old bachelors: formidable, a bit lonely, and harboring within them stories that are far more interesting than they let on. And rather dangerous if you get too close, because if they start cracking, the whole world better listen up. They are powerful and if they aren't taken care of, we'll have an awful problem on our hands.
