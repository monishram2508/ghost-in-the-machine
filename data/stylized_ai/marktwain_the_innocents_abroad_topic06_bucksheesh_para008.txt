Now, about this bucksheesh, this Eastern lubricant that keeps the wheels of commerce, and indeed, most every other wheel, spinning in a land East of Suez. It ain't bribery, mind you, not in the bald-faced, villainous way we understand it back home. Oh, no, that's too uncouth. It's a little…more *refined*. Think of it as a gentle persuasion, a lubricant of the palm, a silent symphony of suggestion, played out with a coin or two instead of fiddles and flutes. You want your donkey to move a bit faster? Bucksheesh. You need a rug merchant to suddenly discover he can shave a few piastres off the price for such a discerning customer as yourself? Bucksheesh. You wish to avoid a bureaucratic entanglement that would unravel your very sanity and leave you an unraveled thread in the tapestry of Oriental inefficiency? Well, friend, you know what to do. Bucksheesh.

The greenhorn, fresh off the boat, clutching his Bradshaw's Guide and brimming with righteous indignation, will undoubtedly harrumph and declare it an outrage, a corruption of the highest order! He’ll thump his chest and proclaim the purity of his own intentions, forgetting, of course, that he likely slipped the porter a dollar to expedite his luggage at the docks back in New York. Human nature, I suspect, operates on the same principles the world over, just with slightly different currencies and conversational euphemisms. This bucksheesh, it's just a more…artful form of that universal truth. A greasing of the squeaky hinge, if you will, on the door to opportunity. And let me tell you, that door can be mighty stubborn without the proper encouragement. Attempting to navigate life without it is akin to trying to ride a camel through the desert on a bicycle – theoretically possible, but guaranteed to leave you both exhausted and thoroughly sunburnt. So, when in Rome, or rather, Cairo, do as the Cairenes do, and carry a few extra coins. You might find yourself surprisingly well-oiled and smoothly navigated through life's prickly thickets.
