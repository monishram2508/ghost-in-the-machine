Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a faith tradition that emerged in the United States during the 19th century. Its history is deeply intertwined with its founder, Joseph Smith, who claimed to have received divine revelations that led to the translation of the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible. This text, along with other writings, outlines a unique theology that includes beliefs about the nature of God, the plan of salvation, and the restoration of Christ's original church. A core tenet involves the concept of continuing revelation, meaning God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets in the present day, a belief that distinguishes them from many other Christian denominations. Early Mormon history was marked by persecution and westward migration, culminating in the establishment of a community in Utah, led by Brigham Young after Smith's death. This challenging period fostered a strong sense of community and self-reliance, which continues to be a defining characteristic of the faith. Today, Mormonism has grown into a global religion with millions of members worldwide, known for their missionary work, emphasis on family values, and charitable endeavors. Young men, and increasingly young women, often serve voluntary two-year missions, spreading the gospel and engaging in service projects. The church also places a strong emphasis on education and encourages members to pursue lifelong learning. While adhering to a strict moral code, including abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, and emphasizing modesty in dress, Mormonism also values community involvement and encourages participation in civic life. Despite historical controversies and ongoing debates about its unique doctrines, Mormonism has become an influential force in American society and beyond, contributing to diverse fields ranging from arts and culture to business and politics.
