Baden, ah, Baden! A place where dukes and duchesses go to bathe away their sins, or at least, that’s what they tell themselves. It’s a town perpetually draped in mist, like a dowager in a veil, hiding wrinkles and reminding everyone that something vaguely important and probably boring is just out of sight. The waters, they say, are miraculous. They bubble up from the earth, hot enough to scald a frog but, naturally, perfect for curing gout and melancholia in a prince. I’ve dipped a toe in myself, and I can report that it felt suspiciously like water from a boiler. Still, it’s the principle of the thing, isn’t it? One must *believe* in the miraculous properties, just as one must believe the opera singer can actually hit those high notes without spontaneously combusting.

The Kursaal, now there’s a sight. Gilded and glittering like a magpie’s nest, it’s where the well-heeled congregate to lose fortunes at the tables. The air inside is thick with perfume, cigar smoke, and the desperate hope of striking it rich. I saw a countess, once, lose her diamonds, her pearls, and then, if I’m not mistaken, the deed to her ancestral castle, all in the space of an hour. She emerged looking remarkably serene, though I suspect a small flock of vultures circled her carriage all the way home. And the food! Oh, the food! Mountains of pastries, rivers of champagne, enough richness to clog an elephant’s arteries. One could gain a stone simply by looking at the buffet table. It’s a wonder anyone ever leaves Baden alive, let alone cured. But leave they do, invariably poorer, perhaps slightly more rheumatic, but certainly with tales to tell – embellished, of course, because what’s a story without a healthy dose of exaggeration? It’s Baden, after all, where even the truth is a little bit gilded.
