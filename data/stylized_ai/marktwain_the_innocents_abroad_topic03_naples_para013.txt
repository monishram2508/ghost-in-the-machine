Naples, ah, Naples! A city that clings to the slopes of Vesuvius like a beggar to a crust, and just as noisy about it, I might add. One arrives expecting a vision of classical ruins and sun-kissed bays, and one *does* find them, sandwiched rather inelegantly between a boisterous throng of humanity and a disconcerting fragrance of something both culinary and questionable. The streets, bless their chaotic hearts, are a symphony of near-misses, a ballet performed with carts piled high with melons, Vespas weaving like drunken wasps, and pedestrians who seem to believe the sidewalk is merely a suggestion. One marvels that any limb remains intact by twilight.

And the laundry! One would think the city fathers had mandated that every citizen air their linen simultaneously, for it festoons every balcony, a riot of colours that rivals a sunset, and obscures half the view. One might think it a signal, perhaps, a vibrant semaphore code only understood by Neapolitans. I attempted to decipher it myself, but all I could glean was an overwhelming preference for floral prints. The people, bless their operatic souls, are a study in contradictions. They'll haggle fiercely over a bunch of grapes, then cheerfully give you directions that lead you utterly astray, all with a smile that could melt the glaciers of the Alps. They’ll loudly proclaim the superiority of their mother's tomato sauce whilst simultaneously bribing the waiter for an extra dollop of yours. The driving, mind you, is a peculiar art form. Traffic lights are apparently mere suggestions, and the horn is not so much a warning device as an expression of existential joy. And yet, somehow, it all works. Somehow, the carts don't collide, the Vespas don't pulverize, and the pedestrians, against all odds, survive. Naples, you see, is not a city to be understood, but a city to be experienced, like a good sneeze or a particularly potent cup of coffee – startling, invigorating, and leaving you with a lingering aftertaste you're not entirely sure you enjoyed, but wouldn't trade for the world.
