Chamonix, you say? A most peculiar village clinging, as it does, to the foot of Mont Blanc like a lovesick burr to a tweed coat. One arrives with expectations as lofty as the mountain itself, envisioning hardy alpinists hacking away at glaciers with icy axes, and perhaps a jolly St. Bernard trotting about with a miniature cask of warming cheer tied 'round its neck. What one finds, instead, is a bustling hive of humanity, largely occupied with the rather less romantic pursuit of acquiring exorbitantly priced souvenirs and consuming vast quantities of melted cheese. The air, instead of being crisp and bracing, is thick with the scent of frying potatoes and the faint, underlying perfume of anxious sweat – likely emanating from the poor souls contemplating the bill for their fondue.

The mountains, naturally, are still present, bless their silent, snow-capped hearts. They loom, indifferent to the human drama unfolding below, seemingly amused by the spectacle of chaps in brightly colored ski suits attempting to emulate the grace of a mountain goat. And the glacier, Ah, the glacier! One glimpses it from afar, looking rather like a rumpled, dirty bed sheet flung down the mountainside. It is, I am assured, quite impressive up close, though I confess my own explorations were largely confined to the vicinity of establishments serving vin chaud. It is a marvel, indeed, how the allure of perilous heights and frozen landscapes can be so readily translated into the earthly delights of a well-poured glass and a comfortable chair. In the end, Chamonix is not so much a place for conquering mountains as it is for conquering one's appetite and, perhaps, one's initial naiveté. A charming, overpriced, and altogether unforgettable experience, akin to being robbed by a particularly jovial highwayman while simultaneously enjoying a delightful picnic.
