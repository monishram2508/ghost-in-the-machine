Baden-Baden, they call it. A place so nice, they named it twice, which strikes me as either redundant or deeply suspicious, depending on the state of my liver at the moment. It's a town positively drowning in dukes and dowagers, each one more delicately preserved in ambergris and afternoon tea than the last. They flit about the Kurhaus like moths drawn to a particularly opulent flame, clutching their pocketbooks and radiating an air of gentle, well-perfumed ennui. The air itself is thick with the scent of money and mineral water, a combination which, I confess, leaves me feeling slightly bilious. One can hardly swing a cat (though why one *would* in such a refined establishment is a mystery) without hitting a titled somebody discussing the therapeutic properties of the thermal baths, or the unfortunate necessity of wintering in Nice.

And the baths themselves! One plunges in, hoping for rejuvenation, and emerges feeling only slightly cleaner and considerably more like a poached egg. One sees vast expanses of skin, draped upon frames both skeletal and remarkably well-padded, all bobbing gently in a tepid soup of alleged healing power. I half expected Neptune himself to surface, clutching a rubber duck and demanding a towel. Still, one mustn't complain. It's all dreadfully civilized, you see. A sort of purgatory for the privileged, where the sins of excessive wealth are washed away in lukewarm water and expiated through tedious rounds of waltzes and whispering campaigns. I swear, the backbiting in that place is more invigorating than any spa treatment. A body can't help but wonder if half of them aren't there simply to glean gossip and compare the size of their diamond necklaces, like magpies squabbling over particularly shiny bits of string. Indeed, it’s quite a spectacle, a grand, gaudy tableau of human vanity set against the backdrop of the Black Forest, which, by comparison, seems positively subdued.
