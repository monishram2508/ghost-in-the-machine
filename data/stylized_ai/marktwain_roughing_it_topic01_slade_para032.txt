Now, Slade. A fella could write a whole book 'bout Slade, and still not plumb the depths of that scoundrel's depravity. I've seen claim jumpers with more morals, and that's saying somethin'. He was a terror, that Slade, a regular two-legged cyclone a-brewin' up trouble wherever he went. Had a way about him, though, like a rattler charm'n a bird, folks were drawn to him despite knowing good and well he was bad news. He ran the Pony Express station at Rocky Ridge, a dusty, fly-specked oasis in the middle of nowhere, and he ran it with an iron fist, mind you. A fist often wrapped around a Colt revolver. 

Stories swirled around him thicker than dust devils in a Nevada gust. Tales of hangin' men for stealin' horses, and stealin' horses himself, I reckon. One story I heard, a fella tried to argue with Slade 'bout a bill, a measly few dollars it was, and Slade, calm as a summer creek, pulled out his bowie knife and nailed the bill right to the fella's forehead. Said somethin' 'bout "payin' in full." Whether that was true or just the usual tall tale gettin' taller, I couldn't rightly say. But I wouldn't put it past him.

He was a contradictions, that Slade, that's for certain. One minute he'd be gamblin' away his last dollar with a grin on his face, the next he'd be givin' half his grub to a starvin' family passin' through. He was a hard drinker, a fast shooter, and a man who didn't take kindly to bein' crossed. I suppose you could say he was a product of his environment, a wild, lawless land where a man had to be tougher than a boiled owl just to survive. But some folks are just ornery to the bone, and Slade, well, he seemed to take a particular delight in it. Makes you wonder if maybe he practiced bein' bad just so he could get really good at it. A curious character, indeed, that Slade, a stain on the landscape and a legend in the making all at the same time.
