Well, now, I reckon I’ve seen some sights in my day, from the muddy banks of the Mississippi to these here dust-choked Nevada hills, but the Mormons, them’s a peculiar bunch, alright. I stumbled upon their Zion out in Utah some years back, and a more industrious, sober-sided community I never did see. Neat little farms, rows of identical houses, and the ever-present whisper of industry – like a beehive stirred up but instead of honey, they're collecting souls, if you catch my drift. They’re a polite enough lot, always offering a “Howdy” and a tract or two, but there’s a certain, shall we say, *earnestness* in their eyes that can be a mite unnerving. Like they know somethin' you don't, and are just waitin' for the opportune moment to enlighten (or convert) you.

The whole doctrine, now, that’s a real humdinger. Gold plates, angels, and a whole new Testament – it’s enough to make your head spin faster than a roulette wheel. I asked a fella about it one time, a bright-eyed young man with a missionary glint, and he launched into a dissertation that lasted longer than a summer drought. I swear, he quoted more scripture than a Sunday sermon at a revival meeting, and used words I hadn’t even heard of, let alone understood. I just nodded along, pretending to be enthralled, and eventually excused myself to admire the scenery. Figured the Lord wouldn't hold it against me, not with that much concentrated theology aimed in my general direction.

They certainly know how to build a town, though, I’ll give ‘em that. That temple of theirs in Salt Lake City, now, that’s a sight to behold. Makes the Capitol back in Washington look like a doghouse. And their tabernacle, that thing's acoustics are so fine that you can hear a pin drop clear across the room, or so they say. I tried it myself but all I heard was some coughin’ and a fidgety kid, but I suppose that's the nature of hearin’. All in all, the Mormons are a curious and industrious folk, building their kingdom in the desert. Whether that kingdom is of this world or the next, well, that’s a question for a wiser man than me. I just know I prefer my sermons short and my whisky strong, and I don't see neither being particularly popular down in Utah.
