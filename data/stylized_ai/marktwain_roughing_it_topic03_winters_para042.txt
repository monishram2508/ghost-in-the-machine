Winter, bless its frosted heart, has a way of arriving like a bill collector you forgot you owed, persistent and considerably less charming than you remembered. Down here in Nevada, winter ain't the romantic, snow-dusted affair you read about in them fancy Eastern novels. No, sir. It's more like a prolonged siege of discomfort, a battle waged against the elements where the elements generally hold all the aces. We don't get blizzards of the picturesque variety; we get dust devils masquerading as snow flurries, carrying grit that'll scour the paint off your wagon and leave you spitting sand for a week. The wind, that unholy terror, howls down from the mountains like a pack of starving coyotes, rattling windows, snatching hats, and generally conducting itself with a level of rudeness that would make a mule skinner blush. 

Folks claim the cold brings out the best in people, drawing them together around the hearth for stories and camaraderie. Balderdash! The only thing the cold brings out is a fierce competition for the warmest spot by the stove and a near-violent disagreement on whether to keep the blasted fire stoked or conserve precious wood. Children, usually a bundle of boundless energy, become pale, shivering creatures, clinging to blankets like shipwrecked sailors to driftwood, emitting a continuous, mournful drone that could curdle milk at fifty paces. And as for the animals, well, the coyotes get even bolder, driven by hunger to raid hen houses and sing mournful ballads outside your window at ungodly hours, while the chickens look like they've aged a decade overnight, huddled together in the coop, dreaming of a summer that seems as distant and improbable as a politician keeping his promises. It's a trial, I tell you, a trial by freezing, followed by a brief, muddy reprieve before we're right back at it again, shivering and cursing the very notion of winter itself. A fellow just has to keep telling himself that spring will come eventually. Though some years, I swear, it feels like she's taken a wrong turn somewhere down in Arizona and simply forgotten about us.
