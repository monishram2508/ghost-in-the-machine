Higbie, now there was a specimen. You wouldn't find him gracing the halls of Congress, mind you, nor preaching fire and brimstone from a pulpit. Higbie was a miner, plumb to the marrow of his bones, which I reckon were mostly composed of quartz and fool's gold after spending so long crammed into the earth like a badger gone daft. He hailed, as near as I could gather, from some backwater town in Maine, a place I figured was likely populated entirely by trees and folks who talked slower than molasses in January. How he ever found his way to the Nevada Territory, I couldn’t say. Maybe he mistook the setting sun for a promising nugget.

Higbie had a face like a crumpled saddlebag, wrinkled and brown from sun and worry, and a beard that would shame a billy goat. He chewed tobacco incessantly, spitting with an accuracy that could snuff a candle flame at ten paces. He claimed it kept the dust out of his lungs, though I suspected it had more to do with his ingrained aversion to actually swallowing anything clean. He was a philosopher of the pickaxe, always ready with a homespun observation about the nature of man, usually involving metaphors about hard rock and the fleeting nature of fortune. He never struck it rich, not that I recall, but he never seemed to mind. He'd say, “Digging is digging, whether you hit the mother lode or just more dirt. It’s the trying that counts, and the complaining that keeps you sane.” 

Now, Higbie wasn't exactly what you’d call a church-going man, though I did see him once trying to trade a pocket watch for a front-row seat at a revival meeting. He claimed he wanted to hear the preacher denounce the sins of the miners, so he could accurately catalog them for future reference. The preacher, bless his heart, turned him down. Still, even without religion, Higbie had a certain moral compass, wobbling perhaps, but pointing generally in the right direction. He was honest, in a roundabout sort of way, and loyal to his friends, even if that loyalty involved occasional acts of outrageous foolishness. Higbie, he was a study in contradictions, a diamond in the rough, though admittedly, mostly rough.
