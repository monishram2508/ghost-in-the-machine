Genoa, ah, Genoa! A city piled high against the Ligurian Sea like a precariously stacked deck of playing cards, each card a building older and more crooked than the last. One half expects the whole edifice to topple into the briny deep at any moment, but, bless you, it hasn't yet, and probably won't. It clings to the hillside with the tenacity of a particularly stubborn barnacle, its narrow streets, or rather, *caruggi*, winding like a drunken sailor's route home after a particularly enthusiastic evening of sampling the local vino. And speaking of sailors, Genoa breathes with a salty breath, a tangible reminder of its days as a maritime republic, back when it was tossing doges around like confetti and giving Venice a run for its money (though let’s be honest, Venice always had a certain je ne sais quoi, didn’t it?). One wanders through these labyrinthine alleys, expecting to stumble upon some long-lost treasure chest, or at least a cat fight of operatic proportions – both equally likely, I assure you. The air hangs thick with the aroma of pesto – a green sauce so potent, it could probably fuel a steam engine – and the echoing cries of vendors hawking their wares with a vigor that suggests their lives depend upon it. The architecture, my friend, is a delightful hodgepodge. One minute you're staring up at a grand palazzo, fit for a king (or at least a very wealthy merchant), the next you're squeezed between two buildings so close together you could shake hands with your neighbor across the way – assuming they’re not currently hanging laundry out the window, which, in all likelihood, they are. It's a city that assaults the senses, a glorious, chaotic mess of beauty and squalor, a place where the ghosts of pirates and potentates mingle with the present-day bustle, a veritable opera performed on a stage of cobblestones and crumbling facades. You'll either love it or hate it, but you certainly won't forget it, any more than you'd forget being mugged by a particularly persistent flock of pigeons.
