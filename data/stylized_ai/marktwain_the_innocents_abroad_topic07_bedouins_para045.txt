Now, these Bedouins, bless their sun-baked hides, are a breed apart, a species of man carved from the very dust of the desert itself. They’re a sight to behold, draped in flowing robes that billow in the wind like a grumpy genie’s trousers, their faces weathered maps etched with the stories of sandstorms and scorpions. You might think, looking at their lean frames and hawk-like gazes, that they’re perpetually hungry, but I assure you, they’re more likely perpetually suspicious of anything that isn't a camel or a well. They’ll offer you dates and weak coffee with a smile so wide it splits their faces like a dried-up riverbed, all the while calculating whether you’re worth the trouble of robbing blind. Not that they’re thieves, mind you, not in the vulgar sense, but they do possess a certain… *flexible* understanding of ownership, especially when it comes to stray goats and unsuspecting tourists.

I once saw a Bedouin barter a camel for a broken gramophone, convinced he was getting the better deal because the gramophone, when fixed (which it never was), could sing songs of faraway lands. He sat there for weeks, fiddling with the contraption, convinced the music was just around the corner, a triumph of hope over mechanical reality that I found rather touching, in a foolish sort of way. Their tents, black goat-hair affairs, are masterpieces of portable discomfort, hotter than a furnace in the day and colder than a banker’s heart at night. And their language! A torrent of guttural clicks and hisses that sounds suspiciously like a camel arguing with a particularly stubborn sand dune. Yet, somehow, they manage to communicate volumes, mostly about the weather and the price of wool, I suspect. They are, in short, a curious lot, these desert wanderers, a walking, talking, camel-herding paradox, and a fellow could spend a lifetime trying to understand them, only to end up lost in the sands with a thirst for answers as parched as the very land they call home.
