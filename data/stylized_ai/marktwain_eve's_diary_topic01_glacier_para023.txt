Now, about this glacier business, which Adam insists on calling a "river of ice," as if frozen water somehow transforms into a self-propelled conveyance. I haven't yet figured out precisely how it navigates without benefit of a rudder or oars, but I suspect it’s a story he tells to impress upon the younger angels. At any rate, it is a colossal affair, this glacier, all shimmering blue and white like a gigantic opal carelessly discarded by some celestial jewel peddler. It squats there in the valley, larger than most of the smaller paradises, looking for all the world like it's trying to decide if it should stay put or lumber off and crush the entire creation beneath its icy bulk. 

Adam claims it’s been there for ages, patiently carving out the valleys and depositing mountains of rock like a child scattering toys. I asked him if it intended to pick them back up later, but he just gave me that infuriatingly superior Adam look that suggests I lack the capacity to comprehend deep geological truths. One suspects even the animals find the glacier a bit perplexing. The squirrels, who otherwise possess an astonishing knack for stashing nuts, look upon it with a sort of bewildered respect, as if uncertain whether to try burying their winter provisions somewhere within its frozen depths. The bears, bless their furry hides, give it a wide berth, perhaps thinking it's some sort of exceptionally large, slow-moving bear made entirely of ice. Even the butterflies, normally so frivolous and carefree, flutter nervously around its edges, as if fearing a sudden freeze that will turn them into delicate, winged icicles. And, frankly, I can't say I blame them. One feels rather vulnerable when confronted with such a formidable accumulation of frozen H2O. It's enough to make one long for a nice, cozy fire and a tall glass of lemonade. Though, of course, lemonade remains a distant dream since citrus fruits haven't yet been invented.
