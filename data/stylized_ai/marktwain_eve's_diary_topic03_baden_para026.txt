Baden-Baden, ah, Baden-Baden! The very name rolls off the tongue like a well-buttered pretzel, doesn't it? A place where leisure is practically a religion, and the devout pilgrimage from every corner of Europe and a smattering from that audacious upstart, America. One imagines Paradise looking remarkably similar, except, of course, without the persistent undercurrent of medicinal sulfur wafting through the air – a smell which, let's be honest, could curdle milk at fifty paces. One strolls through the Lichtentaler Allee, a promenade so meticulously manicured it looks as if God himself spent a week shaping it with a nail file, and you see them: dukes, duchesses, merchants puffed up like prize pigeons, and women swathed in more silk than a Chinese emperor's burial chamber. They promenade, they preen, they pretend not to notice the ever-present beggars who know perfectly well that a well-aimed cough can loosen a few coins from a tight-fisted countess.

The Kurhaus, naturally, is the epicenter of all this frivolous activity. Inside, fortunes are won and lost with the casual indifference one might show to a dropped handkerchief. I watched one fellow – a portly gentleman with whiskers that could house a family of field mice – lose a sum that would comfortably finance a small war. He simply shrugged, ordered another bottle of champagne, and proceeded to lose an even larger sum. Such stoicism! I daresay, I've seen more emotional displays at a dogfight. And the baths! Those fabled Roman baths, where the elite wallow in tepid, sulfurous water and discuss their gout and their marital woes with equal enthusiasm. Imagine, if you will, being boiled gently alongside a Grand Duchess while she complains about her husband's wandering eye and the ghastly cut of her latest Worth gown. A truly elevating experience, I assure you, especially if you have a strong stomach and a generous supply of smelling salts. One leaves Baden feeling refreshed, invigorated, and – if one isn't careful – considerably poorer. But what, I ask you, is a little financial ruin when balanced against the sheer spectacle of human vanity at its most gloriously, preposterously extravagant?
