Ballou, now there was a specimen. Fresh off the boat, or more accurately, fresh off the stagecoach from some place back East so backwoods the chickens wore carpet slippers, he was. Called himself a lawyer, Ballou did, though I reckon he’d have been more at home trying to sell snake oil to a rattlesnake. Green as grass, that boy was, and just about as useful in a mining camp. Arrived with a trunk full of law books and a face full of expectations, figuring he'd be arguing constitutional law over the proper use of a sluice box. Bless his heart. He probably thought folks out here obeyed laws.

First case he tried, mind you, was defending a fella accused of stealing a mule. Ballou, he starts in on habeas corpus and the right to a fair trial, quoting Blackstone like he was selling salvation. The jury, mostly fellas who’d probably stolen a mule or two themselves, looked at him like he was reciting the alphabet in Sanskrit. The prosecuting attorney, a feller named Big Jim who could chew tobacco and spit nails at the same time, just leaned back and let Ballou tire himself out. Then Big Jim stood up, showed the jury the rope the fella had used to tie the mule, and said, "Gentlemen, is this the kind of justice you want? Letting mule thieves run rampant? I rest my case." Jury found the fella guilty before Big Jim even sat down. 

Ballou, he was dumbfounded, practically foaming at the mouth about due process. He went back to his claim, which was conveniently located right next to the creek for ease of washing off the gold he never found, and declared he was studying up on the finer points of California jurisprudence. Last I saw of him, he was using one of those law books to prop up a wobbly table, muttering something about circumstantial evidence and the price of flour. I reckon he learned a thing or two about real-world justice, though whether he became a better lawyer or just a more resourceful table-setter is anyone's guess. That Ballou, he was a character, all right. A tenderfoot in the land of hard knocks, with a heart full of good intentions and a head full of cobwebs.
