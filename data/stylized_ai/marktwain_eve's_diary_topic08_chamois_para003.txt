Now, about this chamois creature, a mountain goat, they call it, though I swear I saw one wearing a fetching little cravat the other day, which strikes me as un-goatlike behavior unless goats are evolving faster than I'm giving them credit for. A nimble beast, bless its cotton socks – or maybe goat socks, I’m not up on goat fashion – canterin’ up mountainsides that would give a seasoned mountaineer the vapors. Eve tried to pet one once, back when we were experimentin’ with Paradise and such, but the creature gave her such a look, a blend of startled disdain and mountain-born arrogance, that she promptly offered it a fig as a peace offering. Which it ate, mind you, though I suspect it did so just to prove it could get away with eating fruit given to it by the first woman, thereby scoring some sort of eternal bragging rights amongst the chamois fraternity.

The chamois, you see, possesses an air of knowing something we mortals don’t, a kind of lofty amusement regarding our terrestrial pursuits. They seem to say, with a flick of their twitching little tails, “Oh, look at those poor creatures, scrabbling about on the flat ground. Don't they know the view is ever so much finer up here, and the air practically sparkles with wisdom?” They're right, of course, the view *is* better, but the air only sparkles if you've just spent the afternoon scaling a near-vertical cliff face, and frankly, I’d rather take my wisdom in the form of a good apple pie. And their coats, ah, those coats! The softest darn leather you ever did see, which they use to make what they call 'chamois cloths'. Used, they say, to polish your furniture, and indeed it does a mighty fine job of that, but what a waste. Think of what a coat would've looked on Eve.
