Genoa, ah, Genoa! A city crammed tighter than a miser’s fist around a gold sovereign. I confess, I approached it with a certain trepidation, having heard tales of its labyrinthine alleys and its inhabitants’ fondness for bargaining that would make a Yankee peddler blush. And, bless my soul, the tales were not exaggerated. One might wander for hours, lost in a maze of narrow lanes, so dark and twisting that even a cat would require a seeing-eye dog. The buildings lean and huddle together like gossiping old women, their laundry strung across the streets like triumphant banners of domesticity. One half expects to see a brigand leap from a shadowy doorway, brandishing a stiletto and demanding one’s purse, but no, only a stout Nonna, scowling and swatting flies with a rolled-up newspaper.

The harbor, now, that’s a sight to behold. A veritable forest of masts, bobbing like so many drunken sailors after a night ashore. Steamers puff and snort, tugboats dart hither and thither, and the air is thick with the cries of vendors hawking their wares. Fish, of course, is everywhere. Piled high on stalls, smelling ripe enough to knock a buzzard off a fence post. One observes that the Genoese have a peculiar fondness for fried seafood, which they consume with a gusto that suggests they haven’t eaten in a week, though I suspect they partake with such zeal every single blessed day. The Genoese themselves? A shrewd, industrious lot. They seem to have a knack for making a lira out of thin air. I overheard one chap selling a chipped teacup for a price that would make a Tiffany’s shopkeeper envious. He called it "antique" with a wink that suggested he'd unearthed it from the ruins of Pompeii just that morning. Aye, Genoa is a city where one must keep one's wits about them and their purse strings tight. But it is a city that, despite its grime and its grumbling, holds a certain charm – like a rumpled rogue with a twinkle in his eye and a heart of, well, maybe not gold, but certainly a decent quality of brass.
