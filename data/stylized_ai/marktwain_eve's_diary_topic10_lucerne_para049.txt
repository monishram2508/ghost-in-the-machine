Lucerne, bless its heart, is a town that takes its prettiness awful serious. Why, it's practically overflowing with beauty, like a milkmaid with too much cream in her bucket – you just know some's gonna spill. I reckon they polish that lake every morning with chamois cloths and fairy dust, 'cause it shines something fierce, reflecting those mountains like they’re showing off their Sunday best. And the mountains themselves! Pilatus looming like a grumpy old uncle who secretly hands out candy, Rigi pretending to be dignified with its crown of clouds, and Titlis flashing its glacier-teeth at you – all conspiring to make a simple soul feel inadequate. Eve and I strolled along the Chapel Bridge, that ancient contraption that looks like it was assembled by a drunken carpenter after a particularly potent batch of schnapps. The paintings, oh my stars, the paintings! They depict the history of Lucerne, or at least the censored version where nobody ever sneezed or had a bad hair day. Eve declared some of them "charming" - the dear girl’s always had a kind heart- but I suspected she was humoring the local historians. I kept expecting to see a chap in a doublet and hose leap out and demand a toll, or perhaps a knight errant looking for a damsel in distress. Instead, we got a flock of tourists brandishing selfie sticks like weapons, capturing the perfect angle of themselves pretending to be profoundly moved by history. The town is crammed with clocks, each one vying for attention with its chimes and twirls – a regular symphony of punctuality, enough to drive a lazy riverboat gambler stark raving mad. You can practically taste the money in the air, the scent of fine chocolate and handcrafted cuckoo clocks mingling with the faint odor of well-maintained civic pride. It's all so meticulously, painstakingly picturesque that one almost longs for a little bit of good old-fashioned chaos, a runaway goat maybe, or a street brawl over the price of cheese. But no, Lucerne remains stubbornly perfect, a shimmering postcard refusing to acknowledge the existence of laundry day or the occasional cockroach. And danged if it doesn't make you want to come back for more anyway.
