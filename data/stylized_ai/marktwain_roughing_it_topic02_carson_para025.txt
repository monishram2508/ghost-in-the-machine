Well, Carson City. They call it a city, mind you, which is a fine piece of frontier exaggeration if ever I heard one. A city’s got to have something beyond dust devils and politicians thick as jackrabbits, wouldn't you think? And Carson… well, it does boast a Capitol building, a grand-ish affair if you squint real hard and ignore the peeling paint and the pigeons nesting in the cornices. That’s where those politicians congregate, buzzing like a swarm of locusts over bills that likely benefit them a sight more than the poor, unsuspecting miner scratching out a living in the hills. You’ll see them strollin’ about town, those self-important fellows, puffin’ on cigars bigger than my thumb, and wearin' expressions that suggest they just single-handedly saved the entire territory from, say, an invasion of tumbleweeds.

But beyond the Capitol and the occasional fancy saloon with a piano player who knows about three songs (and plays ‘em all equally off-key), Carson's a study in unfulfilled promise. They’d built it up thinkin’ it’d be another San Francisco, I reckon, a boomtown overflowing with gold and opportunity. Only the gold played hide-and-seek, mostly hidin’, and the opportunity seemed to run off with it. What you’re left with is a place that’s permanently stuck halfway to somethin’ grand.

Now, I’m not sayin’ it ain’t got its charms. The air's clear, if a bit dry, and the view of the mountains is enough to make a man forget he hasn’t struck it rich yet. And you’ll find some right fine folk there, hardy souls who can tell a story and drink a whiskey with the best of ‘em. But Carson City, bless its optimistic heart, is more like a stubborn mule than a racehorse. It trudges along, kickin’ up dust and hopin’ for the best, while the rest of the West is off chasin’ rainbows and findin’ somethin’ shiny at the end of ‘em. A feller could get comfortable there, I suppose. Too comfortable, maybe. Like settlin’ into a dust patch and callin’ it home.
