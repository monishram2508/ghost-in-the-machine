Now, about this portier contraption. It's a right peculiar thing, ain't it? Imagine taking a perfectly good door, the kind that knows its duty, swinging on hinges like a dutiful deacon at a church social, and replacing it with...well, glorified bedsheets is the best way to describe it. Aye, fabric, hanging down like a forlorn widow's veil, separating one room from another. Folks call it a portier, fancy French being all the rage these days, but to my mind, it's just a fancy way to avoid slamming the door and letting everyone know you're having a private argument about the price of butter.

I saw one the other day, all velvet and tassels, hanging between the parlor and the dining room. Looked like a stage curtain dropped in the middle of a dinner party, just waiting for a troupe of trained squirrels to burst through and perform Hamlet. And the dust! Good heavens, the dust that gathers on these things. It's a veritable museum of bygone days, holding onto every errant mote and stray cat hair. I suspect if you sneezed hard enough in front of one, you'd unearth a pharaoh and his entire tomb.

And the practicality, or lack thereof! A door, now, a door offers a certain…solidity. You can lean on it, slam it (though I wouldn't advise it, unless you're aiming for a divorce), and even nail a wanted poster to it if the occasion arises. But a portier? It flutters and billows with every breeze, revealing glimpses of forbidden rooms and whispering secrets to anyone passing by. It's like trying to keep a secret with a megaphone. I daresay, a sturdy blanket draped across the doorway would serve just as well, and probably wouldn't harbor as much dust. Though, mind you, it wouldn't have that certain...je ne sais quoi that seems to entrance the highfalutin society ladies. Me? I'll stick with a good, honest door. At least I know where I stand with a door. And it won't judge my housekeeping. Not out loud, anyway.
