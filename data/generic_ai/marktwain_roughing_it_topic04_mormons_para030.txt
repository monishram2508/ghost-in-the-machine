The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist religious movement that originated in the United States in the 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith, Jr., its core tenets center around the belief that the Christian church had fallen into apostasy after the death of the original Apostles and that a restoration of the original gospel was necessary. Smith claimed to have received visitations from God and Jesus Christ, as well as an angel named Moroni, who revealed the location of ancient golden plates containing a record of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. Smith translated these plates, publishing them as the Book of Mormon, which members consider scripture alongside the Bible. Central to Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, meaning that God continues to communicate with humankind through prophets today, just as he did in biblical times. They believe that Smith was such a prophet, and that the current president of the church serves as a living prophet who receives divine guidance.

Mormon theology includes a distinctive view of the afterlife, with a belief in three degrees of glory: the Celestial Kingdom (reserved for righteous followers of Christ), the Terrestrial Kingdom (for honorable people who did not accept the fullness of the gospel), and the Telestial Kingdom (for the wicked). They also emphasize the importance of temple worship, where sacred ordinances such as baptisms for the dead and eternal marriages are performed. These ordinances are believed to extend blessings beyond mortal life, uniting families for eternity. Mormons place a strong emphasis on family values, community service, and missionary work. Young men (and increasingly, young women) often serve full-time missions, dedicating 18 months to two years to proselytizing and sharing their faith across the globe. They adhere to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, and encourages a healthy lifestyle. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown significantly since its inception, boasting a global membership of millions. While their beliefs and practices have often been met with scrutiny and misunderstanding, they maintain a strong sense of identity and strive to live according to their understanding of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
