Now, about these winters out here, they ain't like those fancy, powdered-sugar affairs back East. Back there, a winter's a respectable old gentleman, wears a coat of white, shakes a bit, and tells tall tales of Christmas cheer. Out here, winter’s more like a grizzled prospector, hasn’t bathed since the gold rush, and carries a pickaxe sharper than a politician’s tongue. It ain't civilized, I tell you. First off, she starts sneakily, just a hint of frost nipping at your nose in October, like a playful badger testing your defenses. Then, wham! She jumps you proper, burying the landscape in snow deeper than a claim jumper's lies. And the wind? Lord have mercy, the wind howls like a banshee crossed with a lovesick coyote. It'll find every crack in your cabin, every hole in your britches, and whistle you a tune so cold it'll freeze the marrow in your bones. 

People talk about the beauty of it all, the glistening snow on the evergreens, the way the mountains wear their white caps like proud old geezers. Well, that's all fine and dandy for the folks who ain't got to shovel the stuff, or try to coax a fire out of damp wood when their fingers are numb as doornails. The sun becomes a rare and precious commodity, something you haggle with God for each day. And the social life? Well, it shrinks down to staring at the same handful of fellas in the saloon, all smelling faintly of woodsmoke and desperation. You'd think folks would be miserable, but there's a strange sort of camaraderie that blossoms in the face of such adversity. We all huddle together, swapping stories and swilling whiskey, knowing that spring will eventually come, like a slow-paying debt, and melt this whole infernal mess away, at least for a little while. But until then, we're stuck with old man Winter, a cantankerous old coot who makes you appreciate a good fire and a strong drink more than any sermon ever could.
