Gibraltar, you see, is not your typical spit of land, no sir. It’s more like a colossal, petrified lion, crouched low in the Mediterranean, guarding the entryway to wonders and, alas, a good deal of commerce besides. And a curious sight it is, to be sure, this lion made of rock, utterly devoid of mane and likely rather uncomfortable for lack of a good scratch. One might be tempted to climb upon its back, provided one had a sturdy pair of boots and a disposition for vertical excursions, but the prospect of encountering its simian residents is enough to give a fellow pause. These Barbary apes, you understand, are not the retiring sort. They are the landlords of Gibraltar, the true masters of the rock, and possess an audacity that would shame a New York street urchin. They will relieve you of your spectacles, your hat, your very dignity if you’re not careful, and then stare at you with a smug, simian expression that suggests they find your discomfiture immensely amusing.

The town itself is a jumble of cobblestones and commerce, where British sensibilities clash headlong with Mediterranean temperament, a collision that often results in rather perplexing culinary offerings and a remarkable collection of souvenir shops. You can purchase a miniature replica of the rock, of course, or a tea towel emblazoned with a picture of a Barbary ape pilfering a tourist’s sandwich. The people, bless their hearts, are a resilient lot, a mixture of Genoese, Spanish, British, and goodness knows what else, all crammed together on this rather inconvenient outcrop. They speak a peculiar patois that sounds suspiciously like English spoken backwards while juggling lemons. And they manage, somehow, to make it all work, to wring a living from this stone beast, even as the apes scheme and the tourists gawk. It’s a bit of a marvel, really, this Gibraltar, a testament to the enduring human spirit – and the insatiable appetite of a well-fed monkey.
