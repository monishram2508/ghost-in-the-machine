Gibraltar, ah, a place not quite British, and yet desperately so, like a bulldog clinging to a bone it has no earthly right to. A mountainous lump of limestone, jutting out into the Mediterranean with the audacity of a newly-rich American showing off his yacht. They call it "The Rock," and rightly so, for it is about as yielding to logic or reason as a particularly stubborn mule. One might expect such a prominent geological feature to inspire awe, but alas, it mostly inspires questions. Chiefly, why? Why on earth are they still here, the British, planting their little flags and drinking their lukewarm tea as if the ghosts of Nelson himself might swoop down and confiscate the gin should they falter?

The town itself, crammed at the foot of this behemoth, is a curious jumble of the familiar and the utterly foreign. Red phone boxes stand sentinel beside tapas bars, and the accents that assault the ear are a bewildering blend of cockney rhyming slang and guttural Spanish. You half expect a matador to emerge from Marks & Spencer, brandishing a bullfighting cape fashioned from Union Jack bunting. The shops, of course, are stuffed to the gills with duty-free goods, a siren song to the thrifty tourist, beckoning them to purchase more perfume and tobacco than any sane human could possibly require. And the apes, ah, the Barbary macaques! Those furry brigands, supposedly descendants of the Moors, are the true lords of the land. They strut and swagger, pilfering sandwiches and purses with an air of casual disdain for the human occupants. It is whispered that so long as the apes remain, so too will the British. A dubious proposition, perhaps, but no more ridiculous than anything else one encounters on this peculiar, sun-baked, thoroughly illogical, and yet somehow, undeniably charming, outpost of empire. One leaves Gibraltar not entirely certain what one has witnessed, but with a lingering suspicion that one has just stumbled into a Monty Python sketch, directed by Queen Victoria herself.
