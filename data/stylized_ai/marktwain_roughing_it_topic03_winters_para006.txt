Winters in these parts—Lord, they’re a caution! Not the sort of milksop affairs they have back East, mind you, where a fellow can get by with a thin overcoat and a sniffle. No sir, out here, winter arrives like a debt collector with a sawed-off shotgun, demanding every last cent of your warmth and comfort. It’s a blasted, glittering tyranny, I tell you. The wind, that thieving varmint, howls like a banshee with a toothache, snatching at your hat and coat tails, trying to drag you off to its icy dominion. And the snow? Well, now, the snow starts out all innocent-like, a pretty white blanket covering the ugliness of the land. But don't let that fool you. Give it a week, maybe two, and it’ll be piled up to the eaves of your cabin, making you feel like a burrowing mole instead of a self-respecting citizen.

And the cold! A man could swear the very bones in his body were turning to ice. You’d huddle around the stove, feeding it wood like a glutton at a free buffet, and still feel the chill seeping in. Even your thoughts seemed to freeze up, making conversation a slow, laborious process. “Fine weather,” you’d say, even though the thermometer was registering something akin to the temperature of a witch’s heart. The livestock, bless their simple souls, just stood around looking miserable, their breath clouding the air like miniature volcanoes. And don’t even get me started on the joys of chopping wood in sub-zero temperatures. A man could swing an axe all day and still feel like he'd accomplished less than a politician at a town meeting. Then there's the frozen spit; that’s a real annoyance, landing with a crack like a pistol shot. But all in all, if a man can survive one of these winters without losing his mind or a few extremities, he can consider himself well and truly seasoned. Come spring, he’ll appreciate the sunshine and the taste of green things more than a condemned man appreciates a pardon. Though sometimes, come spring, I find myself half-tempted to pack up and move south, just to spite that old man Winter. But then again, where's the fun in that?
