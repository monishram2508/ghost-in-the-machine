The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian denomination founded by Joseph Smith in the United States during the 19th century. Central to their belief system is the Book of Mormon, which they consider scripture alongside the Bible. Mormons believe that the Book of Mormon is a historical record of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas, supplementing and clarifying biblical teachings. Joseph Smith, according to Mormon doctrine, translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates revealed to him by an angel, and it narrates the visitation of Jesus Christ to the Americas after his resurrection. Key tenets of Mormon belief include the importance of continuing revelation, the concept of premortal life, the potential for eternal progression, and the significance of temple ordinances such as baptism for the dead and eternal marriage. These ordinances are performed in temples, which are considered sacred spaces where members make covenants with God and receive blessings not available elsewhere.

Mormon theology differs from traditional Christian doctrines in several significant ways. For example, they have a unique understanding of the Godhead, which they believe consists of three distinct and separate beings: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. They also believe in the potential for human beings to become like God through obedience to his commandments and the attainment of knowledge and righteousness. Family plays a central role in Mormon life, and they emphasize the importance of strong family relationships and raising children in the gospel. Missionary work is also a defining characteristic of the Church, with young adults often serving voluntary missions for a period of 18 months to two years, sharing their beliefs and performing community service around the world. The church has a hierarchical structure, with lay members participating in leadership roles at the local level and a presiding prophet and apostles guiding the overall direction of the Church globally. Through their faith, service, and adherence to the principles outlined in their scriptures, Mormons strive to live a life centered on Jesus Christ and his teachings.
