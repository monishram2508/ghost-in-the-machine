Heidelberg, bless its quaint little heart, clings to the Neckar like a lovesick maiden to a departing swain. One might almost suspect the river of purposely meandering so dramatically just to show off the town’s pretty face to the casual tourist. And pretty it is, I confess, though possessed of a certain calculated prettiness, like a debutante whose dimples are suspiciously well-placed. The Schloss, that grand old ruin presiding over all, is the very picture of romantic dilapidation. They say it was struck by lightning, then ravaged by the French – rather like my Aunt Hildegarde’s complexion, come to think of it. One can wander its crumbling halls, imagining knights and ladies, courtly love and poisoned chalices. Or, more likely, tripping over the uneven cobblestones whilst simultaneously dodging the hordes of camera-wielding Japanese.

The town itself is a delightful maze of cobblestone streets, narrow enough to force one into uncomfortable proximity with shopkeepers eager to sell you cuckoo clocks and beer steins. The beer, by the by, is quite palatable, though I suspect the picturesque surroundings enhance the flavor considerably. I saw one fellow attempt to carve his name into the famous ‘Studentenkarzer,’ the old student prison. He was promptly shooed away by a grim-faced warden, who, I dare say, had seen it all before. The students themselves, I observed, are a merry lot, carousing in the local taverns with an enthusiasm that suggests they have no examinations to fear. Or perhaps, more realistically, they are simply postponing the inevitable reckoning with scholarly pursuits. I overheard one chap declare, in a voice thick with suds, that he was studying “Existential Despair through the Medium of Lager.” A noble pursuit, indeed. All in all, Heidelberg is a place of charming contradictions – a town steeped in history yet overrun with tourists, a ruin of grandeur that still manages to inspire awe, and a den of learning where the pursuit of inebriation seems to be the primary curriculum. A veritable feast for the eyes, the liver, and the mildly cynical soul.
