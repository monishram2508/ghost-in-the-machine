Genoa, ah, a city stacked so high on the hills that it looks like a drunken architect attempted to build a town out of playing cards after a particularly generous serving of grappa. One street so narrow, I swear I saw two men argue for an hour over who should have the right to exhale first. The houses, painted in hues so faded they seem to whisper stories of forgotten empires and sun-drenched sailors, cling to the slopes like stubborn barnacles on a rusty hull. And the smells, good heavens, the smells! A potent cocktail brewed from the brine of the sea, the earthy aroma of pesto being pounded in ancient marble mortars, and just a hint of something suspiciously fishy, enough to make a cat think twice before accepting a handout. The whole affair is a delightful chaos, a picturesque jumble that would drive a surveyor to despair and a painter to ecstasy. You'll find grand palazzi, once the homes of doges with more gold than good sense, now housing laundromats and families who seem to have perfected the art of drying their linens out of windows on lines strung across alleys so narrow a pigeon could barely navigate them. And the Genoese themselves? Sharp-witted as a stiletto blade and just as likely to use it on you if you try to haggle them down a single lira on a slice of focaccia. They navigate their city with a practiced ease, dodging Vespas like seasoned bullfighters and speaking a dialect that sounds suspiciously like cats fighting in a sack. One gets the feeling that they invented the art of 'doing business' long before America thought to put the word 'corporation' into existence. Genoa, a city built on trade, intrigue, and perhaps, a healthy dose of sheer, unadulterated stubbornness. A place where you can both get lost for hours and find exactly what you weren't looking for – and probably get cheated on the price, but with a smile so charming you won’t even mind.
