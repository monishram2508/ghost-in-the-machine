Now, pard, I ain't no naturalist, nor a scientist nor nothin' fancy like that. I'm just a plain ol' prospector, more comfortable with a pickaxe than a microscope, but I've seen things, I tell ya, things that'd curl yer hair somethin' fierce. And among them things, there's this critter called a pard. You might know it as a leopard, or maybe a panther depending on where the yarn's bein' spun, but out here in the territories, we just call 'em pards, keep it simple, like a deck of cards missin' a few aces. These ain't yer garden-variety house cats, mind you. These are ambush artists, painted by the devil himself with spots 'n' rosettes, blendin' into the shadows like a politician at a poker game. They're quiet as a church mouse sneakin' into the cheese, and quicker than a greased pig at a county fair.

I remember one time, camped out near the Humboldt River, sleepin' lighter than a feather in a dust devil, and I heard it. Just a rustle, a crack of a twig. Figured it was just a coyote, probably got his nose stuck in my cookin' pot again. But then I seen it. Two eyes, shinin' like polished obsidian, lookin' at me with a hunger that made my liver quiver. It was a pard, stretched out on a low limb, lookin' at me like I was the main course at a Sunday picnic. Now, I ain't proud, but I commenced to prayin' faster than a revival preacher, hopin' the good Lord would remember I'd donated a dollar or two at the last sermon. Well, that pard, it just watched me. Like I was a show, and it had paid for the ticket. After what felt like a decade of holdin' my breath, it just yawned, stretched, and vanished into the darkness. Likely figured I was too skinny to be worth the effort. Serves 'em right, them fancy felines, expectin' a five-star meal out here in the sticks. Next time, I'm paintin' myself with stripes and pretendin' to be a zebra, maybe that'll fool 'em. Course, that's likely to attract the wrong kind of attention from the Sioux, but hey, a man's gotta try something to keep them pards off his plate.
