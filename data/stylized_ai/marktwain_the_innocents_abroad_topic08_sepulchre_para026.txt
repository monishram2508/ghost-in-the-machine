Now, a sepulchre, you see, is just a fancy name for a tomb, a final address if you will, for folks who’ve cashed in their chips and gone to that undiscovered country, as the poet fellow put it. But oh, they’re not all created equal, not by a long shot. You've got your common-as-dirt graves, simple affairs where a man might be buried next to his horse, or perhaps a neighbor he never particularly liked. Then you got the mausoleums, great hulking things that look like miniature banks, built of granite so thick you could weather a siege inside. These belong to the swells, naturally, the ones who figured their importance in this world would somehow translate to the next, and so require a grander post-mortem residence.

But a sepulchre, a *proper* sepulchre now, that’s a different kettle of fish entirely. It's usually old, for one thing; none of this nouveau riche business. It’s got the smell of damp stone and secrets clinging to it like cobwebs. You might find it in a forgotten corner of a churchyard, or carved into the side of a hill where no sensible person would build a barn. It’s always got some sort of legend attached to it, too. Maybe the fellow buried there was a pirate, or a magician, or perhaps just an eccentric old codger who left all his money to his cat. And the stonework, oh, the stonework! It’s always got carvings, figures twisted in stone, gargoyles with missing noses, angels who look suspiciously like they're judging your fashion choices. It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if you were to scrape away the moss and find some Latin inscription about vanity or the fleeting nature of earthly possessions, something to remind you that even the fanciest sepulchre is just a hole in the ground with extra decoration. Then you got the inside. Now that, my friends, is always the real mystery. You never quite know what you'll find; Maybe there's old bones still hanging on in there. Now ain't that something to ponder on.
