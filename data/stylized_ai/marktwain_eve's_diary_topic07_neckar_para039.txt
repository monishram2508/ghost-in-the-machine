Now, this Neckar River, you see, isn't one of those grand, booming affairs like the Mississippi, threatening to swallow steamboats whole and rearrange the landscape just for spite. No, sir, the Neckar is altogether more…gentlemanly. More like a well-mannered streamlet that’s grown a bit ambitious. It meanders along with a leisurely pace, as if it has all the time in the world and isn’t particularly worried about getting anywhere in a hurry. One might even accuse it of dawdling, were one feeling particularly cranky that morning. It’s flanked by hills, mind you, all draped in vineyards like so many velvet curtains, each row meticulously pruned and fussed over by fellows who seem convinced their particular grapes are the very reason the sun rises each morning. And those hills, they practically leer down at the river, as if daring it to spill over and drown all their precious vines. Which, of course, the Neckar wouldn't dream of doing. It’s far too polite.

It carries boats, these little pleasure craft mostly, filled with stout Germans indulging in sausage and beer, their laughter echoing off the aforementioned hills. One expects to see a gondolier pop out at any moment, but no, it's all rather more…organized. Even the ducks seem to follow a strict timetable, paddling with a certain purposeful air, as if they're late for a meeting of the Duck Society. And the bridges, ah, the bridges! Stone arches reaching across with an almost theatrical flourish, as if each one is determined to outdo the others in architectural pomposity. You can stand on them, watching the river flow by, and convince yourself for a moment that you’re in a proper, civilized place, a place where things make sense, even if they don’t always agree with your particular brand of nonsense. Though, I confess, I did witness a fellow attempting to teach his Dachshund to swim in the Neckar. That, dear reader, was a spectacle that almost redeemed the entire trip, though the poor dog seemed to disagree most vehemently.
