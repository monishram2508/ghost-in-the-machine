Ah, the chamois. A beast of the mountains, they say, though I confess, having never scaled one of those precipitous things myself, my acquaintance with them is purely secondhand. Like a cat, only goat-sized, and preferring altitudes where a sensible person wouldn't dream of building a gazebo, they are forever skipping about as if defying gravity were a parlor trick. They tell me they're hunted, which strikes me as particularly unsportsmanlike. Imagine, a creature contentedly nibbling at sparse vegetation, only to be interrupted by a fellow in tweed, puffing his way up the incline with malicious intent. Seems a bit of a low blow, if you ask me. Though, of course, nobody ever does.

And the chamois leather! Now there's a story, isn't it? From the hide of these nimble mountain goats, they produce a cloth so soft, so absorbent, it is practically indecent. They say it's excellent for polishing carriages, or wiping the noses of small, perpetually sniffling children, but I suspect its true purpose is far more luxurious. I picture some pampered society lady, dabbing delicately at her brow after a particularly strenuous game of croquet, or perhaps a gentleman of leisure, applying it to his spectacles to better admire the latest danseuse. The poor chamois, risking its neck amongst the crags, never suspecting its hide would one day be wielded in the service of such frivolous pursuits. It's enough to make one question the very fabric of civilization, or at least, the fabric of one's dustcloths. Of course, I could be entirely wrong. Perhaps the chamois *yearns* to be reborn as a fine cleaning implement. It is difficult to ascertain the desires of a creature one has never properly met. But even if it's not their preference, as the good people say, one should never look a gifted rag in the mouth.
