Now, pard, let me tell you 'bout a spectacle I witnessed out in the silver hills, a sight that tickled me somethin' fierce, though maybe not in a way a preacher would admire. It concerned a fella, new to the territory and greener than a sagebrush in springtime, who had come west hopin', I reckon, to strike it rich quicker than a fly swattin' a sugar bowl. He arrived, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, totin' a pickaxe that looked heavier than a senator's promises and a shovel shiny enough to reflect the sun clear back to St. Louis. He'd picked himself a claim, bless his naive heart, right smack dab in the middle of what the local buzzards considered their prime real estate – a stretch of dusty ground where the only things that grew were tumbleweeds and skepticism.

He commenced to diggin', that fella did, with a fervor that would have impressed a colony of ants. He’d swing that pickaxe like he was tryin' to cleave the earth in two, and shovel dirt with the dedication of a Mormon workin’ towards celestial marriage. Days turned into weeks, and the sun turned him redder than a boiled lobster, but still, he dug. He consulted maps older than Methuselah and muttered about geological formations like he knew what they were all about, which, judging by the results, he didn’t. We old timers, perched on the porch of the saloon, watchin' him through half-closed eyes and a cloud of tobacco smoke, took to bettin' on how long it would take for him to figure out he was chasin' a fool's dream. Some said a week, some a month, but I wagered on the first good dust storm. Turns out, I was right. After a particularly fierce blow left him lookin' like he'd been dipped in cocoa powder, he packed up his shovel, his pick, and his dreams, and lit out for the east faster than a greased pig at a county fair. Last I heard, he was sellin' watered-down lemonade back in Philadelphia, claimin' he had valuable mining experience. Made me chuckle, pard. Made me chuckle somethin' fierce.
