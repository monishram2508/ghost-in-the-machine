Carson City, you say? Ah, Carson, a town that clings to the eastern slope of the Sierras like a burr on a mule's backside. I reckon it fancies itself a metropolis, what with its grand state capitol building (a noble structure, mind you, though built with a budget that could barely buy a respectable dog kennel in San Francisco), and its smattering of streets laid out with a geometry that suggests the surveyors had perhaps enjoyed a bit too much of the local mountain dew. They call it the capital, and I s'pose that's true, seeing as that's where they gather all the politicians. It's a place where one can witness a legislative body, assembled from all corners of Nevada, debating the burning issues of the day – mostly involving the price of sagebrush and the proper way to spell 'molybdenum.'

It’s a dry place, Carson, drier than a parson’s sermon on temperance. Dust devils dance down the main street like mischievous imps, teasing at the bonnets of respectable ladies and the coattails of the aforementioned politicians. The air itself feels parched, like it hasn’t tasted a good rain in a coon's age, and the sun beats down with a ferocity that could melt a candlestick. Folks there tend to be laconic, not given to much unnecessary chatter, which is a blessing, considering that half of them are likely engaged in some scheme or another to strike it rich. You see, the lure of the Comstock still hangs heavy in the air, a ghostly promise whispering of fortunes to be made and lost. 

And the society there? Well, it's a motley assortment, a regular hodgepodge of miners, lawyers, gamblers, newspaper editors, and a sprinkling of those "enterprising" ladies who could charm the gold right out of a miser’s pocket. There's a certain rough-and-tumble charm to it, a raw, untamed spirit that you won't find in those polished, refined cities back East. But don’t let that fool you. Underneath the dust and the swagger, there’s a heart beating, a stubborn, resilient spirit that keeps Carson City clinging to life, even when it seems like the whole damned mountain is trying to shake it loose. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I'll partake in a small restorative of my own. This desert air is doing a number on my throat, you see.
