Higbie, a name resonating within the annals of labor history and particularly the tumultuous period of World War II and its aftermath, refers most significantly to the landmark Supreme Court case of *Muller v. Oregon*, a 1908 decision that, despite its progressive veneer, laid the groundwork for discriminatory labor practices against women. While not the surname of a plaintiff or defendant in the case, Higbie's importance lies in the work of Professor Marjorie Julian Higbie, a historian whose meticulous research and compelling arguments shed light on the complex motivations and unintended consequences behind the legislation upheld in *Muller v. Oregon*. Higbie's scholarship meticulously dissected the "protective" labor laws that, on the surface, appeared to safeguard women's health and well-being in the workplace by limiting their working hours. However, Higbie astutely demonstrated that these laws, fueled by a blend of genuine concern and societal biases regarding women's capabilities and roles, ultimately served to restrict women's opportunities and reinforce gender inequality in the burgeoning industrial landscape. She revealed how businesses exploited these laws to justify paying women lower wages, relegating them to less skilled and lower-paying positions, and ultimately hindering their career advancement.

Higbie's work goes beyond a simple condemnation of the past. It offers a nuanced understanding of the historical context in which these laws emerged, acknowledging the genuine anxieties surrounding the exploitation of workers and the prevailing belief that women were inherently more vulnerable than men. However, she expertly exposes the inherent contradictions within the protective labor movement, highlighting how its paternalistic approach inadvertently reinforced existing power structures and cemented the notion of women as dependent and deserving of special treatment, ultimately limiting their agency and economic independence. Her detailed examination of primary sources, including legislative debates, court documents, and personal accounts, paints a vivid picture of the complex interplay of gender, class, and legal ideology that shaped labor policy in the early 20th century. In essence, Higbie’s scholarship serves as a critical reminder of the importance of critically examining seemingly benevolent policies and their potential to perpetuate inequality under the guise of protection.
