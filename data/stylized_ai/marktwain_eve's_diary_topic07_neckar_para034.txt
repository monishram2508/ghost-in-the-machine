Well, I swan, if it isn't the Neckar River, that indolent serpent winding its way through Württemberg like a ribbon dropped by a tipsy princess. One might be forgiven for mistaking it for a particularly sluggish creek, what with its habit of dawdling past vineyards so steep they threaten to send grapes tumbling right into the water for a drunken baptism. They call it the “Neckar,” you see, though I'm hard-pressed to figure out why it couldn't have been something more…dramatic. "The Mighty Neckar," perhaps? No, that wouldn't do, the river’s far too modest for such grandiosity. Still, modest as it is, it provides a certain charm, especially when the sun catches those little ripples just right, and the reflections of the castles perched precariously on the bluffs dance like drunken revelers.

I reckon there's something to be said for a river that doesn't try to be too important. Unlike that bombastic Rhine further west, the Neckar doesn't thunder and roar. It just sort of…meanders. It’s like an old fellow telling a story, pausing every now and then to puff on his pipe and admire the scenery. And what scenery it is! Those half-timbered houses, clinging to the riverbanks like barnacles on a ship, each one more crooked and picturesque than the last. And the people! Oh, the good people of the Neckar valley, always ready with a smile and a glass of that surprisingly potent local wine. They say the river's waters have seeped into their very souls, making them as mellow and unhurried as the Neckar itself. Now, whether that's true or just a fancy tale spun by a tipsy vintner, I couldn't rightly say. But, one thing's for sure, a lazy afternoon spent drifting down the Neckar, with a glass of Riesling in hand, is a cure for whatever ails ya. And, if not a cure, at least a pleasant distraction from the inevitable sorrows of life. Just be careful not to fall in, that water looks awfully cold, even in the summer months.
