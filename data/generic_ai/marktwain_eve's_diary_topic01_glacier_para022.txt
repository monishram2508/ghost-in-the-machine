A glacier is a massive, perennial accumulation of ice, snow, rock, sediment, and often liquid water that originates on land and moves downslope under the force of its own weight. These dynamic ice bodies are formed over many years, often centuries, through the gradual compaction and recrystallization of snow. As snowfall accumulates, the overlying layers compress the lower layers, forcing out air and transforming individual snowflakes into denser, granular ice known as firn. With continued pressure, the firn further transforms into glacial ice, a dense, crystalline substance that exhibits a distinctive bluish hue due to the absorption of red light by the tightly packed ice crystals. The immense weight of the ice causes it to deform and flow, a process driven by both internal deformation (creep) and basal sliding. Internal deformation occurs as the ice crystals slip past each other within the glacier's mass, while basal sliding involves the glacier sliding over a thin film of meltwater at its base, which acts as a lubricant. The rate of glacier movement varies greatly, depending on factors such as ice thickness, slope angle, temperature, and the presence of meltwater. Some glaciers flow only a few centimeters per year, while others, known as surging glaciers, can move several meters per day.

Glaciers are powerful agents of erosion, transporting vast quantities of rock and sediment. As they flow, they scour and grind the underlying bedrock, carving out characteristic U-shaped valleys and leaving behind features such as striations, grooves, and polished rock surfaces. Glacial erosion also creates cirques, bowl-shaped depressions at the head of glaciers, and arêtes, sharp, knife-edged ridges formed between adjacent cirques. The debris eroded by glaciers, known as glacial till, is a heterogeneous mixture of unsorted sediments ranging in size from clay particles to massive boulders. This till is deposited in various landforms, including moraines (ridges of till deposited at the glacier's edges), eskers (sinuous ridges of sand and gravel deposited by meltwater streams within the glacier), and drumlins (elongated hills of till aligned in the direction of ice flow). Furthermore, glaciers play a crucial role in the Earth's water cycle, storing vast amounts of freshwater and releasing it slowly through meltwater runoff. They are also sensitive indicators of climate change, as their size and extent are directly affected by temperature and precipitation patterns. The ongoing retreat of glaciers worldwide is a clear sign of global warming and has significant implications for water resources, sea level rise, and ecosystem stability.
