The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian church that was founded by Joseph Smith in the United States in 1830. Central to their beliefs is the Book of Mormon, which they hold to be a companion scripture to the Bible and which they believe narrates the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. Joseph Smith, considered a prophet by Latter-day Saints, is believed to have translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates revealed to him by an angel named Moroni. This foundational text, along with the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, supplements the Bible and provides further doctrinal guidance.

A key tenet of Mormon theology is the concept of continuing revelation, the belief that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets and apostles in the present day. This distinguishes them from many other Christian denominations that believe revelation ceased with the death of the original apostles. Mormons also have a distinctive understanding of the afterlife, including the belief in three degrees of glory in heaven, the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial kingdoms, based on their faithfulness to God's commandments during their mortal lives. Temple worship is another significant aspect of Mormon practice, involving sacred ordinances, such as baptism for the dead and temple marriage (sealing), which they believe are essential for eternal salvation and family unity. Latter-day Saints are known for their strong emphasis on family values, community involvement, and missionary work. Young members, typically men around 18 and women around 19, often dedicate 18 months to two years of their lives to serving full-time missions, proselytizing and performing service in various locations around the world. They adhere to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. The church has grown significantly since its inception and is now a global organization with millions of members worldwide.
