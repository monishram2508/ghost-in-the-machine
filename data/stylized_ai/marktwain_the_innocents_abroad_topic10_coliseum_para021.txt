Now, this Colosseum, or Coliseum as the common tongue has it – a name that sounds suspiciously like some medicinal concoction brewed by a quack – is a spectacle, I tell you, a veritable mountain of brick and stone designed for the express purpose of entertaining folks with blood sports. It’s a grand, crumbling affair, standing there like a weary old gladiator himself, scarred and beaten, yet still radiating a certain undeniable grandeur. You could build a good-sized town within its walls, I reckon, and still have room left over for a dog fight or two. They say emperors sat upon high, giving thumbs up or thumbs down with the gravity of a hanging judge, deciding the fates of poor souls armed with nothing but a sword and a prayer. Makes you wonder what kind of entertainment *they* would offer today, given the advances in our society. Perhaps a particularly dull debate on the merits of the gold standard, or maybe a performance of opera so agonizingly long and slow it could drive a saint to murder.

But, in seriousness, it's a curious thought, isn't it? That a people so advanced, so refined in their architecture and aqueducts, would find such primal joy in watching men and beasts tear each other apart. It strikes me as a bit like admiring the intricate carvings on a butcher's block – a certain appreciation for artistry mingled with the uncomfortable knowledge of the purpose to which it is put. And, of course, the tourists! Lord, the tourists! A veritable plague of them, swarming through the ruins with cameras flashing like fireflies in a summer field. They snap pictures of every crumbling archway and every weed growing from the stones, as if they could somehow capture the spirit of the place in a small square of film. One half expects them to begin chipping off pieces to take home as souvenirs. Perhaps, they think to themselves, if I own a piece of the Coliseum, I too, will embody it's historical value. Ah well, so goes the world.

It’s a reminder, I suppose, that human nature, like a stubborn weed, persists no matter how carefully we cultivate the garden of civilization. And so we stand, gazing upon the ruins of this magnificent, and undeniably savage, monument, and ponder on the strange and often contradictory nature of humankind, a creature capable of both building empires and tearing them, and each other, apart. A most peculiar beast, indeed.
