Slade, now there was a station to curl your lip at. A grim oasis in a howling desert, it was, a spot so lonesome the coyotes likely howled a mournful opera just for company. Built smack-dab on the Overland Stage route, it served as a sort of pit-stop for weary travelers, though "pit" might be the operative word, given the quality of the grub and the general atmosphere. I reckon they called it a station, but “fortified outhouse” might have been closer to the mark. The buildings looked like they were constructed out of spite, the only level surface being the bar, and that was likely achieved by propping it up with old newspapers and broken dreams. 

The inhabitants, well, they were a sight, a collection of grizzled prospectors, gamblers with eyes like chipped flint, and women who’d clearly seen better days… considerably better days. You could smell the whisky and despair radiating from them like heat off a tin roof on a summer’s afternoon. The conversations were brief, usually involving the price of beans or the odds on a horse race that took place three weeks ago. And the flies! Bless my soul, I’ve seen swarms of locusts with better manners. They buzzed about like tiny, winged demons, eager to sample every unguarded crumb and sip. 

The only entertainment to be had was watching the stagecoach arrive, a moment of genuine, if fleeting, excitement. It was like watching a drowning man clutch at a straw – a brief injection of fresh faces and potentially interesting gossip into a sea of stagnant boredom. But even that was fleeting. The horses were changed, the passengers stretched their legs, and then, poof, the stage was gone, leaving Slade to sink back into its customary stupor, like a bear returning to its den after a brief, and utterly pointless, foray into the world. A fella could lose his faith in humanity just by spending an afternoon at Slade, I reckon. I certainly came darn close.
