Now, about this sepulchre business. It's a peculiar thing, ain’t it? Folks spending all this time and treasure on a box to house what's left after the spirit's done flown the coop. Seems a mite extravagant, considering the tenant ain't likely to be too particular about the decor. I reckon they wouldn't object to a good, plain pine box any more than they would a marble mausoleum carved up finer than a bride's wedding cake. But no, we gotta have the pyramids of Giza, or at least a humble imitation thereof, even if the fellow inside was happier tending his garden than contemplating eternity.

I’ve seen 'em, all sorts. Grand sepulchres for fellas who couldn't manage a thank you, and crumbling headstones for the kindest souls you’d ever meet. Makes you wonder if the afterlife has a grading system based on tombstone quality. "Ah, welcome, Mr. Rockefeller! Your splendid sepulchre earns you immediate access to the celestial boardroom!" Meanwhile, poor Aunt Millie, bless her cotton socks, she's stuck in limbo, waiting for someone to weed her humble patch of dirt.

Of course, I understand the sentiment, or I think I do. It's not really for the departed, this sepulchre hullabaloo. It's for the livin'. A grand show of grief, a lasting testament, a desperate attempt to hold onto something solid when all else has dissolved into the ether. Like trying to bottle smoke. You can build the grandest sepulchre this side of the Mississippi, but it ain't gonna bring back that twinkle in yer grandpappy's eye, or the way your mama could make a pot roast sing. It's just a pile of rocks or fancy wood, and no matter how grand, it's always gonna be emptier than a politician's promise. Truth be told, a good memory, a shared laugh, a kindness done, those are the true sepulchres, the ones that house what really matters long after the stone has crumbled and the inscription's faded. And they don't cost a dime, which is a blessed relief to a man with empty pockets and a healthy skepticism about the monument-making industry.
