Well, I’ll be hornswoggled if I ever saw a more peculiar bunch than these Mormons out in Utah. Imagine, a whole city sprouted up in the middle of nowhere, Salt Lake City they call it, lookin’ for all the world like a misplaced piece of New England, only drier and preachier. Brigham Young, that's the fellow running the whole shebang, a regular Caesar in homespun. He's got wives aplenty, they say, enough to populate a small town all by himself. And you see them, bless their cotton socks, meek and mild, walkin' around with that air of quiet resignation, like they’ve misplaced their car keys and can't quite recall where they parked the buggy.

They're industrious, no denying that. Turn the desert into a garden, they did. Irrigation canals snaking all over the place, crops growin’ like weeds, though I suspect some unholy bargain with the devil to make things sprout that quick. And they're hospitable, too, in their own way. Offer you a glass of lemonade even if they think you’re a Gentile sinner destined for the fiery pits. Though, mind you, that lemonade probably has some secret ingredient, like ground-up crickets or maybe a dash of holy water, who knows what all they put in that stuff.

Their religion, now that’s a whole different kettle of fish. Angels dictatin’ books, golden plates buried in the ground, a history of America that's got more twists and turns than a politician's promise. It's enough to make a fella’s head spin. But you gotta hand it to 'em, they believe it, every last word. And they stick together, thicker than thieves, protectin’ their own and lookin' out for each other. Maybe there’s somethin’ to be said for all that, even if I can't quite wrap my head around it. Still, makes for a good yarn to tell back East, that’s for sure.
