Carson City, you say? Lord love a duck, that place! A more barren patch of alkali flats trying to pass itself off as a town I’ve seldom clapped eyes on. You go there expecting something grand, seeing as it's the capital of Nevada, and you find… well, you find a collection of frame houses looking like they lost a fight with a stiff breeze and a couple of saloons that smell faintly of regret and sour whiskey. The legislature, bless their cotton socks, meets there, and judging by some of the laws they come up with, they must be fueled by nothing but bad coffee and the burning desire to make life interesting for everyone else. Why, I once saw a bill proposed that would make it illegal for a jackrabbit to hop across the main street during the hours of noon and one, punishable by a fine of – get this – carrots!

Now, there are folks who'll tell you Carson is a rising star, a phoenix from the ashes of the Comstock, brimming with potential and all that jazz. But I reckon those folks haven't spent much time inhaling the desert air, which carries with it the distinct aroma of dashed hopes and unfulfilled dreams. The streets are wide, mind you, wide enough to drive a whole herd of mules through, side-by-side, but mostly they’re just dusty and empty, save for the occasional stray dog looking as dejected as the town itself. They tried planting trees, I hear, but the poor things just withered up and died, like they took one look around and thought, "Nope, not worth it." Even the politicians seem a little embarrassed to be there. They hold their meetings, pass their laws, and then scramble back to Virginia City or Reno as fast as their horses can carry them, like they're afraid Carson City might somehow rub off on them. Still, it's got a certain… charm. A rough-and-tumble, backwoods, “I’ve-seen-better-days” kind of charm, the kind that makes you scratch your head and wonder how it keeps on truckin', even when it probably shouldn't. Makes a fella think, if Carson City can survive out here, maybe there’s hope for the rest of us after all.
