Heidelberg, bless its ancient heart, is a town seemingly built entirely for the convenience of picture postcards. One might suspect the Almighty, after designing the Rhine Valley with rather more extravagance than strictly necessary, tossed in Heidelberg as a whimsical afterthought, just to give tourists something to sigh over with melancholic glee. The castle, perched atop a verdant hill like a drunken old knight clinging to his helmet, is a ruin, of course. What European castle isn’t? One expects them all to have suffered the indignity of being blown up at some point, usually by a disgruntled neighbor or a particularly ambitious lightning bolt. Still, it’s a delightfully picturesque ruin, allowing one to imagine, with reasonable accuracy, the sorts of noble shenanigans that transpired within its walls – mostly involving bad poetry, over-salted sausages, and clandestine meetings behind tapestries, I imagine. The university, ah, that’s another story. It appears to churn out bright young minds with impressive regularity, though whether they’re pondering the mysteries of the universe or merely scheming to outwit the local baker for the last almond croissant is anyone’s guess. And the Neckar River! So charmingly blue, especially when reflecting the aforementioned castle. One can drift along it in a little boat, serenaded by accordion music and the gentle clinking of beer steins, feeling rather grand and European. Though, I must confess, after a few hours of it, one does start to wonder if there's anything more to do than drift and contemplate. Perhaps a vigorous game of croquet, or a spirited debate about the proper way to fold a napkin? No matter, for Heidelberg, in its own peculiar, postcard-perfect way, is a place where one can happily spend a day, or a week, pretending to be a character in a particularly sentimental fairy tale. Just be sure to pack your sensible shoes, and a healthy dose of skepticism – and perhaps a phrasebook, in case the almond croissant situation becomes truly dire.
