Now, about this glacier, a monstrous slab of ice, if you please, that would make Noah himself shiver in his boots. It sprawls across the landscape like a slumbering leviathan, a frozen testament to the winters of yesteryear, and likely a few more to come, judging by its stubborn demeanor. One imagines it was a tad bit smaller when the Almighty first set it down, but centuries of snow accumulation have certainly padded its figure rather generously. It moves, they say, with the speed of a politician making a promise – imperceptible to the naked eye, yet ever so slowly grinding away at the unfortunate terrain beneath. It’s a patient brute, this glacier, content to reshape valleys and carve out lakes at its own leisurely pace, having learned long ago that haste makes waste, especially when you’re dealing with several tons of frozen water.

Folks come from miles around to gawk at it, and well they should! It's a sight that makes you wonder what sort of cataclysmic shenanigans nature has in store for us next. They peer into its icy depths, hoping, I suppose, to find the frozen remains of a mammoth, or perhaps a disgruntled Viking chieftain who took a wrong turn centuries ago. Mostly they find dirt, and little streams of water, which, let's be honest, are far less exciting. These tourists, bless their hearts, trudge about in their sensible boots and point with their cameras, snapping pictures to show the folks back home. "Look what I saw!" they'll exclaim, conveniently omitting the fact that the glacier looked pretty much the same yesterday, and will likely look the same tomorrow, unless it decides to calve off a chunk the size of Manhattan, which, I suspect, it has every right to do. All in all, the glacier is a grand show, a spectacle that reminds one of the Earth's unhurried power, a power that makes a fella consider wearing wool socks, even in July.
