Now, these Bedouins, bless their wandering souls, they're a curious lot, ain't they? Imagine a fella perpetually moving, with nary a fixed address save for the patch of sand his tent calls home tonight. Their houses are made of goat hair, mind you, not exactly the brick and mortar mansions one finds back in Connecticut. And they call it home sweet home, go figure. They roam about the desert like tumbleweeds with a purpose, driving camels and goats ahead of them. Always searching, it seems, for greener pastures, or at least, less brown ones. One can't help but admire their grit, though, clinging to a life that'd make a banker weep with sheer existential dread. They're wrapped head to toe in cloth that looks like it’s seen better centuries, but they swear it keeps them cool. Cool like a cucumber in the Sahara, that is, which is to say, not very.

They drink camel’s milk. Now, I've tasted some peculiar things in my travels, but camel’s milk... well, let’s just say I suspect they've grown immune to its particular charms over generations. And their coffee? Bitter enough to curdle the devil's blood, and they drink it out of tiny little cups that look like they were designed for Lilliputians. But hospitality? Ah, that's where these desert wanderers truly shine. You could be a stranger, a Turk, or even... heaven forbid... a tax collector, and they'd still offer you a seat by the fire and a cup of that eye-watering coffee. Just don't expect them to understand your complaints about the price of oats, or the intricacies of railroad bonds, unless you happen to run into a particularly well-traveled camel driver who’s taken to reading discarded newspapers from passing caravans. It's a land of mystery out there in that desert, and those Bedouins, they're a part of its ancient and enduring riddle. A riddle best admired from a comfortable distance, preferably with a decent cigar and a glass of something a bit more civilized than camel’s milk.
