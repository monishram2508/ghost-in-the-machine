Baden, ah, Baden! A spot where one can observe humanity at its most gloriously ridiculous, a veritable Noah's Ark, only instead of two of every creature, there are two hundred of every variety of mustache, each vying for supremacy upon the upper lip of some portly Herr Doctor or retired sausage magnate. One goes to Baden, not for the mountain air – which, mind you, is quite passable, if a bit heavy with the scent of money and expensive hair tonic – but for the spectacle. It is a place where grand duchesses, their faces powdered to resemble freshly milled flour, totter along the Lichtentaler Allee, clinging to the arms of gentlemen who look as if they’ve swallowed a billiard table whole. The gentlemen, in turn, sport expressions of strained patience, as if they are waiting for the duchesses to spontaneously combust, thus freeing them to sneak off to the casino and attempt to recoup the morning’s losses by betting on the number of times a waiter will drop a tray of strudel.

The waters, you see, are touted as having remarkable curative powers, capable of healing everything from gout to a bruised ego. I suspect, however, that their primary function is to provide a convenient excuse for copious amounts of leisure. The cure is not in the water, dear Eve, but in the utter lack of anything resembling useful labor. One drinks the water, one promenades, one gossips, one loses a small fortune at cards, one repeats. It is a perpetual motion machine of frivolity, oiled with champagne and fueled by the anxieties of the nouveau riche. And yet, one cannot help but find a certain charm in the whole charade. Like watching a troop of performing monkeys dressed in miniature frock coats, it is absurd, it is pointless, and yet, undeniably diverting. The Germans, bless their methodical souls, have managed to transform indolence into a high art, a veritable science of doing absolutely nothing with the utmost decorum and self-importance. I confess, even I, with my aversion to pretense, found myself strangely drawn into the vortex of elegantly orchestrated boredom. Perhaps there truly is something curative in the air after all, if only the power to forget, for a brief and luxurious moment, that there is anything else in the world besides oneself and one’s next spa appointment.
