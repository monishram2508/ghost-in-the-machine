Chamonix, they call it the "capital of alpinism," which sounds grand enough to put ribbons on a goat and parade it down Main Street. But after enduring a coach ride that jostled my innards like dice in a gambler’s cup, and breathing air so thin a hummingbird would faint, I’m inclined to believe "capital of altitude sickness" would be a more accurate banner. The mountains, bless their snowy hearts, do attempt a show of majesty. Mont Blanc, the big cheese himself, looms like a frosted wedding cake abandoned after the vows, though I suspect his frosting is more ice and less sweet. The place is littered with tourists, naturally; a motley crew of mountaineers flexing their dubious bravado, ladies in impractical heels teetering over cobblestones, and enough Germans wielding cameras to stage a paparazzi convention. One imagines they're all hoping to capture the essence of "the Alps," though I wager they'll find more essence of overpriced fondue and aggressively indifferent waiters. I even saw a gentleman, puffed up like a pigeon with indignation, arguing with a vendor over the cost of a miniature Saint Bernard. The whole affair reeked of the absurd. One moment you’re admiring the sublime peaks, thinking profound thoughts, and the next you’re dodging rogue skis and dodging the spray of a water fountain enthusiastically malfunctioning, while the air is punctuated by the persistent clatter of cowbells. It’s a symphony of the sublime and the ridiculous, played out against a backdrop of unparalleled natural beauty. I’d even say, with a touch of begrudging admiration, that Chamonix manages to be both utterly captivating and utterly exasperating, a feat I suspect requires a special kind of mountain magic... or perhaps just a well-stocked apothecary for altitude-induced headaches.
