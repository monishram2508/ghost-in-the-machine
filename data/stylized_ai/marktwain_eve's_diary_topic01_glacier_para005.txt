Now, this glacier, bless its ponderous heart, it ain't like any iceberg you'd find bobbing about in the ocean, trying to chill the champagne. No sir, it's a landlubber of ice, a fellow chained to the earth, though you’d never know it to look at the speed it moves. Why, a snail with rheumatism could outpace it on a downhill run, no question. This one, they tell me, is called a glacier, a fancy name for a frozen river that hasn’t the good sense to flow with any sort of respectable haste. Imagine, if you will, taking water, the very epitome of fluidity, and slowing it down 'til it resembles a petrified molasses in January! 

The locals hereabout, they treat it with a reverence normally reserved for church socials and prize-winning pumpkins. They’ll tell you stories, long-winded and probably embellished, about how it carved out this valley, grinding rocks and mountains like a giant, frozen coffee mill. Seems a bit boastful for a thing that spends most of its time napping, if you ask me. But then again, I suppose even the laziest among us deserves a little credit for accidents committed in our youth. And it’s got a certain grandeur to it, I’ll give it that. A colossal, blue-tinged majesty that makes a body feel mighty small and insignificant, like a mosquito buzzing around an elephant's behind. Though I can’t help but think it’d be a sight more useful if it melted down and provided some irrigation for these dusty farms. But, then again, a glacier without ice is like a senator without a platform – purely ornamental, and of no earthly good to anyone but itself.
