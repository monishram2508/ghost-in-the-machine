Slade, that one-horse burg huddled up in the Reese River Valley, it weren't exactly a garden of earthly delights, no sir. Claimed it was a town, Slade did, but I reckon a family of jackrabbits could’ve held a convention there without feelin’ crowded. The buildings, such as they were, looked like they'd been slapped together by a blind carpenter with a grudge against right angles. Mostly just a scattering of frame shacks and tents, all lookin’ thirsty and sun-baked, like they were beggin’ for a cloud to pass by and spit on ‘em.

The inhabitants, well, they were a study in rugged individualism, or maybe just plain orneryness. Miners mostly, with faces lookin' like they'd been carved outta granite and personalities to match. A fella could smell the dust and desperation on 'em from fifty yards away. They spent their days clawin’ at the earth, hopin’ to strike it rich, and their nights drownin’ their sorrows and boasts in rotgut whiskey at the "Finest" saloon, which looked about as fine as a coyote’s backside. I saw more than one fistfight break out over a misplaced card or a carelessly worded insult. Seemed like the only entertainment they had was tryin' to rearrange each other's facial features.

The whole place had that “get rich quick or die tryin’” feel to it. You could almost hear the land groanin’ under the weight of all those hopeful dreams and dashed expectations. Even the dogs there looked discouraged, trotting around with their tails between their legs, probably figurin’ they were just as likely to end up bankrupt as their owners. Slade, it was a place where a man could make his fortune, or lose his shirt, or maybe even his teeth. Me, I reckon I preferred to keep my shirt, and my teeth, so I tipped my hat to Slade and kept movin’ on down the trail. Figured my chances were better out there in the wilderness, than tryin' to strike it rich in that den of ambition and grit.
