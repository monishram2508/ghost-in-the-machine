Lucerne, now there's a town fit to make a saint swear off halos and seek out a decent cigar. I reckon Eve herself wouldn't have traded her apple for a view of that lake, shimmering like a misplaced piece of sky. But don’t let the picture postcard fool you, dear. Beneath the charm, there's a humbug of industry, grinding away at souvenirs and cuckoo clocks. The tourists, bless their bewildered hearts, wander about like lost sheep in a shepherd's daydream, snapping photographs of the Kapellbrücke as if it'll vanish come sunset. One can scarce walk without being jabbed by an umbrella or trampled by a fellow desperate to acquire a Swiss Army knife with more attachments than a centipede has feet. The locals, they've seen it all before, of course, their faces as stolid as the mountains that cradle the town. They watch the spectacle with a detached amusement, like theater-goers observing a particularly outlandish play.

The Lion Monument, now that's a sight, I’ll grant you. A carved beast, eternally dying, in a pose that would make a melodramatic actress blush. It's meant to be mournful, I suppose, but to my eye, it looks more like a lion who's had a particularly bad day with his dentist. And the stories they tell! Each guide offers a new and improved version of the tale, each more embellished than the last. One swears the sculptor wept actual tears into the stone, another claims the lion occasionally winks at pretty women. It's enough to make a body wonder if truth ever sets foot in Switzerland. But I wouldn't have missed it for the world, mind you. For all its pretense and inflated sentiment, Lucerne’s got a certain something about it. A stubborn refusal to be taken too seriously, a wink hidden behind a facade of respectability. It’s like a woman who’s spent her life in silks and pearls, but still knows how to tell a good bawdy joke. And that, my dear, is a rare and precious thing indeed.
