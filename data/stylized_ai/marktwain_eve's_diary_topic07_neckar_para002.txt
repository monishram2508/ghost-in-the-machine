Now, about the Neckar. Bless its watery heart, a river it surely is, though some might mistake it for a particularly ambitious creek, especially when the summer sun has had its way with it. A fellow could almost skip across it in places, though I wouldn't recommend it unless you're partial to a mud bath and the attention of several concerned villagers. I’ve seen grander rivers, certainly, rivers that could swallow the Neckar whole and barely burp, but grandeur isn’t everything, is it? It has its charm, this Neckar, the sort of unassuming charm you find in a slightly rumpled traveling salesman with a twinkle in his eye and a tall tale always on the tip of his tongue.

It meanders, you see, through valleys greener than a newly-minted dollar bill, past vineyards clinging to the hillsides like persistent children, and under bridges that look like they've been wearing the same coat of paint since Charlemagne's day. Heidelberg sits upon its banks, pretty as a painted postcard, though some say a little too pleased with its own reflection, which is, of course, the castle shimmering in the water. The river, I suspect, has seen it all before. It has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the loves and losses of generations, and probably a fair share of poorly-aimed fishing attempts. I’ve cast a line in it myself, mind you, and mostly caught reflections of my own increasingly bewildered face.

Folks say the water’s a bit on the industrial side, these days, but who am I to judge? Even the most virtuous river has its secrets, and a little bit of honest industry never hurt anyone, as long as it’s not actively turning the fish into two-headed monsters. All in all, the Neckar is a good, honest river, if a bit unassuming. It may not inspire epic poems or daring voyages, but it provides a pleasant view, a gentle burbling soundtrack to an afternoon stroll, and a constant reminder that even the smallest things can possess a certain quiet dignity. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I hear the siren call of a glass of local wine, which, I’m told, pairs rather well with the view from the riverbank. Though, I suspect, it’d pair well with just about anything after a long day of pontificating on the virtues of slightly underwhelming waterways.
