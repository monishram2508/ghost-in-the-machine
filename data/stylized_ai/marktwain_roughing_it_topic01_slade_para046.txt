Slade, that alkali dust-hole squatting out there where the mapmakers gave up and just wrote "Desolation" – well, she ain't much to look at, I reckon, but a body could do worse than breathe her dubious air. A body could, say, be dangling from a hemp rope six foot off the ground, courtesy of Slade's self-appointed Committee on Public Decorum. Now, I ain't saying they're trigger-happy, mind you. Just enthusiastic in their application of justice, the sort that favors a quick draw and a slower deliberation. The town, she herself, is a study in haphazard architecture, like a drunkard trying to build a card house in a hurricane. One-story shacks lean against two-story saloons which in turn are propped up by optimistic-looking timbers that groan under the weight of accumulated dust and regret.

The inhabitants? A tapestry woven from the threads of desperados, prospectors who've seen better days (and worse luck), and women who learned long ago that charming smiles and a well-placed derringer go further than a needle and thread. You might find a preacher there too, likely holed up in the least drafty corner of the "Last Chance Saloon," trying to save souls between sips of whiskey and shouted poker bets. I saw one there, arguing with a faro dealer about the nature of sin. Last I heard, the dealer was winning, both the argument and the pot.

Food? Ah, that's a subject for another time, perhaps when I've completely forgotten the taste of fried salt pork and beans cooked in what I suspect was repurposed engine grease. The water, bless its heart, runs a peculiar shade of ochre, flavored with just a hint of mine tailings. But it's wet, by gum, and in this neck of the woods, that’s practically a luxury. So, if you ever find yourself headed towards Slade, bring a strong stomach, a loaded pistol, and a generous supply of chewing tobacco. You'll need 'em all. And maybe, just maybe, you'll survive long enough to tell me about it. I, myself, am considering writing a book about it, titled something like "Slade: A Place Where Even the Vultures Carry Luggage," or perhaps something snappier. Haven’t decided yet.
