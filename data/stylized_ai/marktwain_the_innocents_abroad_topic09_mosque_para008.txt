Now, concerning these mosques, edifices dedicated to the Almighty, or at least, so the inhabitants of these lands avow. I reckon you'd find 'em sprinkled across the landscape like so many misplaced chess pieces, each one declaring its presence with a minaret reaching for the heavens – a rather ambitious undertaking, if you ask me, considering the company it's keeping down here. They call the faithful to prayer from these towers, a melodious caterwauling that echoes across the rooftops, prompting fellas to drop their shovels and carpets to unroll like magic, and prostrate themselves facing Mecca. A curious sight, I must confess, especially to a fella like myself, who's more accustomed to facing a good stiff drink at the saloon.

Inside, they're all hushed reverence and intricate designs, carpets softer than a politician's promises. No pews, mind you, just acres of carpet where a body can kneel and beat his forehead against the floor till the good Lord takes notice. There’s no art to speak of, none of your gaudy biblical paintings or graven images, which, frankly, is a darn sight more sensible than some of the artistic abominations I've laid eyes on. Just calligraphy, looping and swirling across the walls like a drunkard’s signature. Makes you wonder if the scribes ever had a bit too much date juice before setting pen to parchment.

You see fellas wander in and out, some weary travelers seeking respite from the desert sun, others devout followers mumbling prayers like they're reciting a laundry list. They remove their shoes at the door, creating a haphazard pile that threatens to topple over like a stack of poker chips after a losing hand. It's a peculiar custom, this shoe-removing business, though I suppose it keeps the carpets a tad cleaner than if fellas were to track in half the Sahara. All in all, these mosques, they're a testament to faith, or perhaps just a fondness for ornate carpets and loud public pronouncements. Hard to say for sure, and I’m not one to judge a man's devotion, unless, of course, it involves cheating at cards. Then, by thunder, judgment shall be passed!
