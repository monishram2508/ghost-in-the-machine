A glacier is a colossal, persistent body of ice, formed over centuries or even millennia by the accumulation, compaction, and recrystallization of snow. Unlike sea ice which forms from frozen seawater, glaciers originate on land, typically in high-altitude or high-latitude regions where snowfall exceeds snowmelt. These icy rivers are not static; they are in constant, albeit often imperceptible, motion, driven by the immense pressure exerted by their own weight and the force of gravity. The internal deformation of the ice, known as creep, allows the glacier to slowly flow downhill or outwards. This movement is influenced by factors such as the slope of the underlying terrain, the thickness of the ice, and the presence of meltwater at the glacier's base, which can act as a lubricant.

Glaciers play a crucial role in shaping landscapes. As they advance, they erode the underlying bedrock through processes like abrasion, plucking, and freeze-thaw weathering, carving out valleys, creating cirques, and leaving behind characteristic features like U-shaped valleys and moraines. Moraines are ridges of unsorted sediment deposited at the sides and terminus of the glacier, marking its former extent. The meltwater produced by glaciers feeds rivers and lakes, providing a vital source of freshwater for many communities and ecosystems. Glaciers also act as natural reservoirs, storing vast quantities of water as ice and releasing it gradually during warmer periods, regulating streamflow and mitigating the effects of drought.

However, glaciers are highly sensitive to changes in climate. Rising temperatures cause increased melting and decreased snowfall, leading to glacier retreat and thinning. The rate of glacier loss has accelerated dramatically in recent decades, particularly in regions like the Arctic and the Himalayas, posing significant threats to water resources, sea-level rise, and ecosystem stability. The melting of glaciers contributes to sea-level rise, threatening coastal communities and infrastructure. Furthermore, the loss of glaciers can alter river flow patterns, impacting agriculture, hydropower generation, and aquatic habitats. Studying glaciers and understanding their response to climate change is essential for predicting future impacts and developing strategies for adaptation and mitigation.
