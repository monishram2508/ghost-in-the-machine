The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian denomination founded by Joseph Smith in the United States during the 19th century. Central to their faith is the Book of Mormon, which they believe to be another testament of Jesus Christ and scripture comparable to the Bible. This book, along with the Bible and other texts like the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, form the core of their scriptural canon. The church emphasizes a literal interpretation of the Bible, coupled with modern revelation, to guide its members in their daily lives. Mormons believe that the original Church established by Jesus Christ fell into apostasy and that Smith was chosen by God to restore it to its original purity. This restoration includes the re-establishment of priesthood authority, which they believe is essential for performing saving ordinances such as baptism and temple sealings.

A strong emphasis is placed on family life, with the belief that families can be eternally sealed together in temples. Temple worship is a significant aspect of Mormon practice, involving sacred ordinances and covenants designed to strengthen faith and promote spiritual growth. The church actively engages in missionary work, with young members often volunteering for two-year missions across the globe, proselyting and providing community service. Mormons adhere to a strict health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, and encourages a healthy lifestyle. Tithing, the donation of ten percent of their income, is a key principle, and these funds are used to support the church's operations, charitable endeavors, and building projects. The church has a hierarchical structure, led by a prophet and apostles, who provide guidance and leadership to the global membership. Latter-day Saints have a distinct cultural identity characterized by strong community ties, moral conservatism, and a commitment to service and education. While historically facing persecution and controversy, the church has grown significantly and is now a global faith with millions of members worldwide, playing an increasingly prominent role in social and political discussions.
