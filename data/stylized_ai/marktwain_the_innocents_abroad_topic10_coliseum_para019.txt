Now, this Coliseum, this grand old ruin in Rome, is quite a sight, I must confess, though rather dilapidated around the edges, as one might expect after a couple of millennia of rowdy spectators and the occasional earthquake or two. Imagine, if you will, a gigantic stone donut, only instead of powdered sugar, it’s coated in centuries of dust and the ghosts of gladiators past. They say that within those crumbling walls, lions and tigers and bears, oh my, used to tear into poor souls while the Emperor, bless his heart (and I use the term loosely), would give a thumbs up or thumbs down depending on his mood. One might think that’s barbarous, and perhaps it was, but let's be honest, folks enjoy a good spectacle, be it a play, a political debate, or a good old-fashioned wrestling match, just as much now as they did back then. Only these days, we tend to swap the lions for lawyers and the gladiators for congressmen; the bloodshed is less literal, but the savagery, I suspect, remains roughly the same.

And the crowds! Oh, the throngs of people that used to pack this place, shouting and hollering. I wager they had a grand time, eating grapes, betting on their favorite combatant, and generally making a ruckus. One can almost hear them, even now, if one strains one’s ears and drinks enough of that local wine, which is itself a bit of a gladiatorial contest for the palate. They were a volatile bunch, those Romans, quick to praise, quicker to condemn. I suppose it’s the Italian temperament, a bit like a simmering pot of tomato sauce, always threatening to boil over. But all things considered, it was quite the show, this Coliseum business, a testament to human ingenuity, and our eternal fondness for watching others suffer for our amusement. A rather morbid fondness, perhaps, but there you have it, human nature in all its glorious, appalling splendor, etched in stone for all eternity.
