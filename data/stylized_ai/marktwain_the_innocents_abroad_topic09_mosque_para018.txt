Now, concerning this edifice they call a mosque – a mighty peculiar construction it is, and no mistake. I’ve seen more plain horse stables, I swear, though some are gussied up fit to make a preacher blush. It’s generally a right imposing affair, often sprouting minarets like petrified asparagus reaching for the heavens, seemingly daring God Almighty to take notice. And notice He must, judging by the racket that emanates from those towers five times a day. A fellow could set his pocket watch by the blaring, a regular summons to prayer, or perhaps a warning to neighborhood cats, depending on your disposition. Inside, it's typically a rather bare affair, compared to, say, a saloon. No spittoons, mind you, or ladies of questionable virtue. Just carpets thick enough to swallow a wagon wheel, and nary a chair to be seen. These fellows seem to prefer prostrating themselves, which, I reckon, saves on furniture costs. They shuffle about, murmuring and bowing like so many clockwork toys wound up by the same unseen hand. One can't help but wonder if they get a crick in the neck, though I suppose the exercise is good for the constitution. The walls, I've observed, are often plastered with flowery curlicues and verses writ in a script that looks suspiciously like hen scratchings. They tell me it’s the word of God, though if God writes like that, I'm sticking with the King James version. I've never quite managed to fathom the whole business, this mosque thing, but I reckon it’s no more bewildering than a Baptist baptism, or a politician’s promise. People cling to their beliefs like ticks on a hound dog, and who am I to argue with a tick? It’s a curious world, filled with curious contrivances, and this mosque, well, it's just another puzzle piece in the grand, eternal jigsaw. A puzzle piece I intend to observe from a safe and respectful distance, thank you very much.
