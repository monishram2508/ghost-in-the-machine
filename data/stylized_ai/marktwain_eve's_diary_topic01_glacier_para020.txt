The glacier, bless its simple heart, is a sight to behold, though a tad slow for my taste. One might think after all these centuries it could pick up the pace a bit, seeing as it’s got a whole mountain practically shoving it along. It lumbers down the valley like a tipsy dowager in a ballroom, all creaks and groans and a general air of impending collapse, leaving a trail of muddy petticoats and shattered glassware (which in this case would be boulders, don’t you know). It’s a wonder to me how something so seemingly permanent can be so undeniably mortal. You see the scratches it leaves on the rocks, like a giant cat testing its claws, and you know it's been here a while, a grumpy old tenant rearranging the furniture to its liking.

But then, the little deceiver starts melting, as any self-respecting chunk of ice should when the sun gets a bit fresh. And that's when the real entertainment begins. The streams that trickle and gush and eventually become roaring rivers, carrying away all sorts of debris – pebbles, sand, the odd tourist who got too close trying to snap a picture. It's a grand cleanup operation, really, like the glacier is finally deciding to do some spring cleaning after a millennium of neglecting its duties. And the colors! You wouldn't believe the shades of blue tucked away in those icy depths, like a miser’s hoard of sapphires suddenly revealed. It makes you wonder what other secrets the old gal is hiding. Probably lost socks and forgotten dreams, same as the rest of us. The only difference is she stores hers for geologic eras, whereas I can't even remember where I put my spectacles last Tuesday. So much for human progress, I suppose.
