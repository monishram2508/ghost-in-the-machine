Now, Damascus, bless its ancient soul, is a city with more stories crammed into its alleyways than a camel has fleas. Why, they say it's the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, a claim I reckon might be true, seeing as how the stones themselves seem to whisper forgotten tales. I wandered through its souks, you see, a regular maze of commerce and clamor, where the air hangs thick with the scent of spices that could wake the dead and the calls of merchants hawking everything from carpets that claim to be flown in from Persia (probably by a particularly ambitious pigeon) to copperware shiny enough to blind a bat. The Damascenes themselves are a curious bunch, a blend of Arab dignity and merchant cunning, perpetually offering you tea and a "special price" that’s likely just a bit more than what the fellow next door is charging. 

The architecture, well, it’s a sight to behold, a hodgepodge of empires layered one atop another like some grand, accidental cake. You've got Roman columns supporting Ottoman balconies, Mamluk arches framing modern storefronts – a veritable history lesson in brick and mortar. And the Great Mosque! Now there’s a place that could make a heathen weep with reverence, or at least admire the sheer audacity of its grandeur. Of course, even paradise has its quirks. The sanitation leaves something to be desired – let's just say I wouldn't recommend drinking the tap water without a strong dose of faith and a stronger stomach. And the traffic! Lord have mercy, the way those fellows drive is enough to age a man ten years in ten minutes. They treat lane markings as mere suggestions and seem to navigate solely by divine intervention and a healthy dose of honking. Still, despite its flaws, Damascus has a certain undeniable charm, a stubborn, ancient beauty that clings to it like dust in the sun. You might leave with a cough, a sunburn, and slightly lighter pockets, but you'll also leave with a pocketful of memories richer than any sheikh's treasure.
