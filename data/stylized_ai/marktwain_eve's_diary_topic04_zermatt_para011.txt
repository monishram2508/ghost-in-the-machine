Zermatt, you say? Well, I’ve seen hamlets smaller than a beetle's waistcoat and louder than a cat concert, but Zermatt…ah, there’s a place that tries its damnedest to be grand, and almost pulls it off, bless its heart. Imagine, if you will, a village nestled 'neath the ponderous shadow of the Matterhorn, looking for all the world like a child hiding behind its mother’s skirts, hoping to not be noticed. But the Matterhorn, that impudent crag, throws the shadow anyway, and the tourists, thick as flies on a summer sausage, descend. No motorcars, you see, not allowed; only electric buggies that whine and whimper like a teething infant, hauling trunks stuffed with enough finery to clothe a small kingdom. I swear, some of these folk travel here just to prove that even atop a mountain, one can maintain the proper attire for a five-o'clock tea. And the shops! Swiss watches glittering behind glass like captured stars, chocolates piled high enough to induce a sugar coma that would last until Christmas, and enough cuckoo clocks to drive a man mad with the ticking. They cater to every whim, every fancy, every preposterous desire that a wealthy soul might harbor in their breast. I saw one gentleman, ruddy-faced and puffed up like a pigeon, haggling over a hand-carved edelweiss, arguing the price down to the very last franc. A franc, mind you! As if saving that measly sum would make him a king. Still, there's a certain charm to the place, a sort of rugged beauty that persists despite the hordes. The air is crisp, the yodeling echoes off the mountainside, and one can, if one squints hard enough, pretend that they are the only soul on Earth enjoying the majestic view...until the next electric buggy whirs past, reminding you that paradise, like everything else these days, comes with a price tag, and usually a hefty one at that. And don’t even get me started on the fondue – a culinary adventure that’s either sublime or an exercise in stomach churning, depending on the establishment, and the tolerance of your innards.
