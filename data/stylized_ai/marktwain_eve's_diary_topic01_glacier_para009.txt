Well, I declare, if there ain't something peculiar and grand about these glaciers! To think, here's a river, but instead of water, it's plumb full of ice. And not the kind you'd find cooling a mint julep on a veranda, no sir, this is the sort that's been laying around since Noah was a lad, probably. Been sitting there, compressing snow for so long, it's turned a sort of blue-ish, like a forgotten bruise on the earth's shoulder. You reckon it remembers the dinosaurs? Probably thinks we're a right bother, what with our steaming engines and our carryings-on.

And slow, good gracious, is it slow! Why, a snail crossing a desert in July has more get-up-and-go than one of these ice mountains. They say it's always moving, but I've sat here a good hour watching, and I ain't seen hide nor hair of movement. Makes you wonder if them scientists ain't just pulling your leg. Though I suppose, if you wait long enough, it'll eventually grind down mountains and carve out valleys, just like a patient old sculptor. Reckon it's the ultimate testament to perseverance, though I confess, I ain't got the patience to watch it through to the end.

And the noise! Now that's a story in itself. It creaks and groans and rumbles like a dyspeptic giant trying to digest a whole herd of buffalo. Every now and then, you'll hear a crack that sounds like the world's biggest pistol shot, and a chunk the size of a small house will break off and go tumbling into the water with a splash that'd make a whale blush. Gives you a proper start, I tell you. And then, after all that ruckus, it just sits there, placid as a cow chewing its cud, as if nothing at all had happened. Just a big, blue, slow, noisy wonder, that glacier is. Makes you ponder on the secrets it's holding, the stories it could tell if it wasn't so busy being frozen stiff.
