Gibraltar, bless its heart, a chunk of rock sticking out of Spain like a stubborn, albeit diminutive, middle finger. They call it a colony, do they? Well, I’ve seen colonies with more charm and less controversy, I tell you. It's British, by thunder, though the Spaniards across the bay glower at it as if it were a particularly offensive pimple on their otherwise sun-kissed face. One can hardly blame them; imagine waking up every morning to see a symbol of another empire planted firmly in your front yard, like a particularly tenacious weed. The town itself? A jumble of duty-free shops selling more whiskey and cheap perfume than one could shake a stick at, interspersed with pubs bearing names that harken back to Nelson and Waterloo. Patriotic, they are, these Gibraltarians, though one suspects a good bit of the patriotism is fuelled by aforementioned whiskey. And the apes! Ah, the barbary apes. They’re the island’s true royalty, I’d wager. They strut about like they own the place, which, truth be told, they probably do. Stealing tourists’ lunches and posing for photographs with a regal disdain that would make Queen Victoria herself envious. Supposedly, as long as the apes remain, so too will British rule. A convenient superstition, if you ask me, and one that ensures the little rascals are treated with a reverence typically reserved for saints and tax collectors. I witnessed one ape relieve a gentleman of his spectacles, then proceed to examine them with an air of scholarly curiosity before flinging them off the cliff like so much bothersome rubbish. Sums up the whole place rather neatly, doesn't it? A blend of the magnificent, the ridiculous, and the just plain exasperating, all perched precariously on a lump of limestone that's been fought over for centuries. Worth a visit, of course, if only to say you’ve been. Just hold on tight to your belongings, and be prepared for a healthy dose of bewildered amusement.
