Slade, now there was a fellow built for rough country and rougher company. Why, I reckon he could’ve swallowed a grizzly bear whole and used its claws for toothpicks afterward. He was division agent for the Overland Stage Company, which basically meant he was in charge of keeping things moving, come hell, high water, or Injuns with a serious hankering for scalps. And he did keep things moving, bless his black heart. He had a way of "persuading" folks – mostly through the liberal application of firearms and a vocabulary that would make a mule skinner blush – to see things his way. I’ve heard tell of him riding into a stage station, finding a man who'd been cheating the company, and calmly proceeding to shoot him full of holes while calmly continuing to eat his dinner. Polite fella, in a terrifying sort of way. 

Now, some called him a murderer, and others called him a necessary evil. I reckon they were both right. Life out West was a brutal affair, and sometimes you needed a brute to keep things in order. And Slade, he was a brute with a capital "B," followed by a whole string of exclamation points. He had this habit of wearing several revolvers at once, not for show, mind you, but because he actually *used* them all. Stories about him circulated like tumbleweeds in a dust storm. One involved him single-handedly defending a stagecoach against a band of robbers, leaving them all scattered across the landscape like discarded playing cards. Another claimed he’d once had a duel with a notorious outlaw, winning with nothing but a bowie knife and a surprising amount of grace for a man his size. He met a sticky end himself, strung up by vigilantes, which just goes to show you that even the meanest dog can have a bad day. But for a spell there, Slade was the law west of the Mississippi, and a fella had to think twice before crossing him, lest he find himself discussing theology with Saint Peter rather sooner than expected. He was a character, that's for sure, a damnably impressive and utterly terrifying one.
