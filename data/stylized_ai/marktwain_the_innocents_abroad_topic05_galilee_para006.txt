Now, Galilee. That’s a place that’s been yapped about for centuries, I reckon, and by folks who probably haven't spent a week there, let alone a lifetime. They’ll tell you of miracles and fish aplenty, of gentle slopes rolling down to a shimmering sea, the Sea of Galilee, if you please, as if the other seas weren’t good enough. Well, I’ve seen it, and let me tell you, it’s a sight, alright, provided you can squint past the present day. The Sea, it's less sea and more oversized puddle these days, though I wouldn’t say that too loudly around a fisherman looking to make a buck. They’ll swear up and down it’s still bursting with the same fish that swallowed Jonah's great-grandpappy, or something of the sort. Don’t believe a word of it. 

The hills are handsome enough, I’ll give them that. Olives cling to the slopes like gossiping old women, their branches gnarled and twisted from centuries of eavesdropping. But the villages, now, those are another matter entirely. Mud-brick huts huddle together like frightened sheep, and the dust! My stars, the dust could choke a camel. I imagine it’s been settling there since the dawn of creation, patiently awaiting its turn to suffocate the next unsuspecting tourist. And the flies! I swear, they’re bigger and bolder than anywhere else on Earth. They swarm around you like politicians around a promise, and about as likely to deliver on anything worthwhile. Folks tell you about the simple life, the pious folk living in peace, well, that sounds like a load of fish fertilizer. I wouldn’t doubt they’re swindling each other and arguing over goat prices same as anywhere else. Still, if you can get past all that, and the persistent vendors trying to sell you "authentic" Roman coins they carved themselves last Tuesday, there's a certain charm, a certain... well, a certain something. Maybe it’s just the weight of all that history, or maybe it's the sun addling my brain. Either way, Galilee, it's something else, alright. Something to see, and something to escape from right after.
