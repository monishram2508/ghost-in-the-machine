Zermatt, you say? A place where the very air crackles with the self-importance of mountains trying to out-majesty one another, each vying for the title of 'Most Photogenic Alp'. I confess, I found myself quite taken with the place, despite the distinct feeling that every cow bell within a five-mile radius was personally appointed to ensure I didn't oversleep past sunrise. The Matterhorn, of course, stands sentinel over the entire charade, a pointy-headed titan judging the pretension below with stony silence. It’s a magnificent brute, I'll grant you that, though I did find myself wondering if it ever gets tired of being the poster child for Swiss perfection.

The village itself is a peculiar arrangement. No gasoline-powered horseless carriages allowed, mind you! Only these buzzing electric carts, scurrying about like metallic beetles, presumably carrying the very weighty luggage of visitors who believe their wardrobes must keep pace with the altitude. One half expects to see a law enacted dictating that only the finest bespoke tweed and cashmere are permitted within the village limits. The natives, bless their industrious souls, seem entirely unfazed by the influx of these high-altitude dandies. They go about their business, presumably counting their francs and wondering if anyone actually buys those miniature cow bells that are omnipresent in every shop window.

The cost of living, naturally, is on par with purchasing a small kingdom. A simple cup of coffee costs enough to finance a modest expedition up a lesser Alp. Yet, somehow, one doesn’t begrudge it quite so much. Perhaps it's the sheer audacity of the place, or the clean, crisp air that makes even the most dubious expenditure feel almost justifiable. Or perhaps, I had simply been thoroughly swindled by the majestic beauty of it all and was too distracted to notice my dwindling funds. Whatever the reason, Zermatt has a way of turning even the most skeptical observer into a temporary convert, convinced that a life among snow-capped peaks and exorbitantly priced chocolates is a life well-lived, at least until the credit card bill arrives.
