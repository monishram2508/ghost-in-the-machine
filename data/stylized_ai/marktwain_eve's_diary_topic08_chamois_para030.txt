Well, now, about these chamois creatures. I encountered one, or rather, a collection of them, high up in the Alps, where the air thins out something fierce and the view makes a man feel about as important as a flea on a mountain goat. They’re a peculiar lot, to be sure. Imagine, if you will, a goat, but one that has been spending entirely too much time in a gymnasium, toning and sculpting until it's a veritable paragon of athletic grace. Except, bless their little cotton socks, they still retain that goatish air of perpetual suspicion, like they're permanently convinced you’re about to ask them to pay for your dinner.

Their coats are the color of dried leaves in autumn, a practical thing when one lives amongst rocks and snow, and their horns, those elegantly curved hooks, are like the devil's own eyebrow trimmers, perfectly designed for a bit of stylish grooming, or perhaps for discouraging overly-enthusiastic wolves. Speaking of wolves, I noticed these chamois were remarkably nimble in their movements. They bounded over the steepest inclines as if gravity were merely a polite suggestion, a feat that put my own clumsy attempts at mountaineering to shame. I confess, I nearly tripped over my own feet just watching them prance about, feeling as dignified as a newborn calf trying to navigate an ice rink.

One fellow, a rather patriarchal-looking chap with a particularly impressive set of horns, caught my eye. He fixed me with a stare so penetrating, I swear he could see clear through to next Tuesday. It was a look that said, "What business do you have here, you lumbering, land-bound creature? Go back to your picnics and your parasols." And, truth be told, I took his advice. I figured arguing with a creature that could outrun, out-jump, and probably out-think me was a fool's errand. So I tipped my hat, or rather, nearly lost it to a gust of wind trying, and left them to their mountainous domain, contented in the knowledge that somewhere up there, a bunch of suspiciously graceful goats were probably having a good laugh at my expense.
