Baden, they call it. Baden-Baden, to be precise, lest one confuse it with some other dreary hamlet afflicted with the same root misfortune. A place so steeped in curative waters and idle aristocracy, you’d think the very air hummed with the sighs of disgruntled duchesses and the rustle of fortunes frittered away at roulette. It’s a grand spectacle, I grant you, this gathering of the European elite, come to soak their weary bones and perhaps, if the fates are feeling generous, win back the cost of their conveyance. The architecture, bless its heart, tries to be impressive – colonnades and marble galore, all designed to make you forget you're essentially boiling yourself like a lobster for medicinal purposes. They speak of the healing properties of the water, of course, claiming it can cure everything from gout to ennui. Though I suspect the only thing it truly cures is the surplus of funds in one's bank account, transferred expeditiously into the pockets of Herr Banker who presides over the Kursaal with the benevolent gaze of a shark circling its prey.

One observes, naturally, the social dances. The ladies, gowned and jeweled to a degree that would make a peacock blush, parade about with an air of weary elegance, their conversations revolving, as far as I can tell, around the precise shade of boredom they’re experiencing. The gentlemen, stiff in their formal attire, discuss matters of import – the latest stock market fluctuations, the scandalous affair of Lady So-and-So, and the utterly devastating hand they suffered at cards the previous evening. It’s a human comedy, I tell you, played out against a backdrop of manicured gardens and simmering sulfurous fumes. One almost expects a character from a Molière play to come bursting forth, declaiming dramatically about lost love and borrowed money. Yet, for all its pretense and posturing, there’s a certain melancholy charm to the place. Perhaps it’s the quiet admission, implicit in every mineral bath and promenade, that even the wealthiest among us are ultimately mortal, seeking solace and perhaps a glimmer of hope in the face of the inevitable. Or maybe it's just the free eau-de-vie they offer after the soaking. One never knows for sure.
