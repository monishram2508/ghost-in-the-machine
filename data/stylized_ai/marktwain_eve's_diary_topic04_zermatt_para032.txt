Zermatt, you say? A village clinging to the foot of the Matterhorn like a lovesick leech to a debutante’s skirt. Bless my soul, it's a spectacle, I tell you! A place where the air is so crisp, it could sharpen a dull spoon, and the silence so profound, you can hear the clinking of francs in a Swiss banker's vault miles away. Carriages, mind you, are the fashionable conveyance – horseless ones, quite unheard of, as if Mr. Benz never troubled the good folk of Zermatt with his infernal combustion contraptions. One can imagine the consternation such a machine would cause; the horses, I dare say, would stage a coup d’état! The inhabitants, sturdy mountain folk they are, tanned like well-worn leather and weathered like granite gargoyles, possess a look that suggests they've seen glaciers retreat and tourists advance with equal indifference.

And the tourists, oh, the tourists! A motley crew if ever there was one, draped in enough fur and tweed to clothe a regiment of bears, all puffing and panting their way up the inclined streets, armed with alpenstocks and a determination to conquer the slopes, or at least conquer the nearest chocolatier. They venture forth, these courageous souls, in pursuit of the sublime views and the elusive perfect photograph, only to return at dusk, rosy-cheeked, a trifle frostbitten, and clutching a Swiss Army knife that boasts enough gadgets to dismantle the Eiffel Tower. As for the Matterhorn, well, it stands there, aloof and majestic, a craggy old patriarch observing the whole fandango with an air of weary amusement. One half expects it to chuckle, a rumble like distant thunder, at the human ants scurrying about its base, each convinced they’re having an awfully important adventure. All in all, Zermatt is a place that tickles the funny bone while simultaneously reminding you of the sheer, breathtaking indifference of nature. A most peculiar and captivating combination, wouldn't you agree?
