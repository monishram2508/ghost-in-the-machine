Higbie, now there was a specimen. Looked like he'd been poured into his clothes and forgot to say when. A man whose face was so furrowed, you could plant potatoes in it, and get a decent crop, too, provided the sun decided to shine on his disposition. Higbie had a claim, naturally, because in this neck of the woods, even the jackrabbits had claims. This one was about as promising as a wet firecracker, a sandy little patch that coughed up more alkali dust than gold. But Higbie, bless his optimistic heart, was convinced it was just a matter of time. "Patience, lad," he'd say, wiping the sweat and grime from his brow with a rag that had seen better days, "Patience, and the mother lode will reveal itself." He'd say that every morning, afternoon, and evening, generally after a swig from his jug, the contents of which, I suspected, had more to do with bolstering his belief than any actual geological survey.

He had this contraption, too, a contraption he called "The Gold Sniffer 3000," which was essentially a forked stick with some wires and bells dangling off it. Claimed it was a divining rod of unparalleled accuracy. Only time I saw it find anything, it led him straight to a gopher burrow, much to the gopher's bewilderment and Higbie's subsequent cussing. But Higbie, he wouldn't be deterred. He was a man driven by the dream, a dream fueled, no doubt, by more than a little bit of wishful thinking and that mysterious liquid in his jug. He'd toil away, day in and day out, humming off-key tunes and swatting at flies, convinced that fortune was just around the corner. And you know, I never had the heart to tell him different. In a land full of hard luck and dashed hopes, a little bit of delusion was often the only thing keeping a man from packing it all in and heading back East, tail between his legs. Higbie, he was a monument to the human spirit, or at least a monument to stubbornness, which, in these parts, was pretty much the same thing.
