Baden, they call it. Baden-Baden, for emphasis, lest ye think ye stumbled into a mere backwater of bathhouses. And bathhouses it has, in abundance, enough to drown a regiment of Prussians, I dare say. Though drowning them would be a chore, what with their insistence on bobbing about in the lukewarm waters like so many corks. It's a place, Baden, where the aristocracy gather, much like flies to a particularly ripe melon. Dukes and duchesses draped in more diamonds than one sees at a jeweler's convention, all murmuring inanities about the latest opera or the price of asparagus. They come to "take the waters," which as far as I can tell, involves sitting, soaking, and stewing in the aforementioned tepid bath, then emerging, pink and prune-like, convinced they've somehow cheated death of a few more years. The Kurhaus is the grandest of the lot, a veritable temple to idleness, with its gilded ceilings and hushed roulette tables where fortunes are won and lost with a blasé air that suggests it's all terribly tiresome. The air itself hangs heavy with the scent of floral perfume, expensive cigars, and the faint, lingering aroma of damp wool bathing suits. One sees more pampered poodles than one sees honest working folk, and those poodles, I suspect, are better fed. The Germans, bless their industrious hearts, have built it all with a Teutonic thoroughness, but even they can't disguise the underlying truth – Baden is, at its heart, a carefully orchestrated charade, a stage upon which the wealthy perform their elaborate pantomime of leisure, all the while hoping no one notices they're slowly turning into human raisins. And yet, and yet... there's a certain undeniable charm to the whole ridiculous spectacle. Like watching a finely crafted clockwork toy, one can’t help but be amused by the intricate, pointless precision of it all. Besides, the Black Forest isn't half-bad.
