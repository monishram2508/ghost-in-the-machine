Carson City, you say? Well, I reckon I've seen towns with more allure in a horse trough. A man could spend a lifetime there and never feel the itch to stay past suppertime, unless he was chained down, of course. It sprawls out on the sagebrush plain like a dropped handkerchief, wrinkled and forlorn, about as exciting as watching paint dry on a fence post. Now, don't get me wrong, it ain't ugly, just... beige. The buildings are respectable enough, mostly brick, all trying hard to look important, puffing out their chests like they're frontin' the gold rush. But you can't fool old Mark. I can smell desperation a mile off, and Carson City was practically bathed in it. 

They've got their government buildings there, naturally, full of fellows with starched collars and grim faces, all busy as beavers building empires of paperwork. I’ve heard tell they spend more time deciding what color to paint the flagpole than actually runnin’ the state. And the silver mines, once the lifeblood of the place, now they just cough up a little dust and a lot of memories. The saloons, though, ah, the saloons are a different matter. There, a man can still find a bit of honest revelry, drown his sorrows in rotgut whiskey, and gamble away his future with a smile. That, I confess, is where I squandered a considerable amount of my own precious time and resources. But who's counting? Not I. 

I remember one particular dance hall queen there, name of Sadie something-or-other, she was pretty as a painted sunset and about as honest as a politician on election day. I wager she extracted more gold from lovelorn miners than the Comstock ever did. But such is life in a town built on dreams and dust. Still, Carson City, with all its blandness, held a certain charm. It was a place where a man could be left alone to ponder the mysteries of the universe, or at least, the mysteries of why he just lost his last dollar at the poker table. And sometimes, that's all a fellow needs.
