Now, this bucksheesh, as they call it out in the Orient – Egypt being a prime breeding ground, mind you – is a marvelously elastic institution. It clings to you like the desert dust, insinuating itself into every corner of your existence. It’s a lubricant for the gears of life, a necessary oil for the squeaky wheels of progress, or at least, that's what they’d have you believe. You might fancy yourself a man of principle, above such petty bribery, but try getting your trunk unloaded at the Cairo station without a little something greasing the palm of that porter. You'll find yourself stranded amidst a sea of fez-topped fellows, each mysteriously afflicted with a sudden and debilitating deafness.

It ain't just a simple transaction, neither. Oh no, bucksheesh is an art, a dance, a delicate negotiation conducted with winks and nods and the subtle rustle of papyrus currency. It's never outright demanded, understand, but rather, delicately hinted at, like a shy maiden hinting at her affections with downcast eyes and a strategically placed handkerchief. You inquire about the swiftness of service, and the fellow replies with a mournful sigh about the exorbitant price of bread and the number of hungry mouths he has to feed. You offer a modest sum, and he eyes it with the disdain of a sultan inspecting a beggar's offering. More is clearly needed, friend.

And it's a contagious thing, this bucksheesh business. You start by slipping a piastre to the boatman to secure a prime seat for a sunset cruise on the Nile, and before you know it, you're doling out baksheesh to the doorman, the donkey boy, the fellow who sweeps the dust off your hat, and even, I swear, to the sand itself, just to keep it from blowing into your face. It makes a man wonder if the pyramids weren’t built more with generous tips than with slave labor. One thing is sure: you’ll leave Egypt lighter in the pocket and heavier in the knowledge that every human interaction, from the sublime to the ridiculous, has a price tag discreetly tucked beneath its robes. And that, my friends, is a truth that ain't confined to the land of the Pharaohs. It merely flourishes there, like a particularly tenacious weed in a fertile, well-watered garden.
