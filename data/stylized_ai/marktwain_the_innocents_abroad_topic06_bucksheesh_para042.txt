Now, about this bucksheesh. A curious custom, is it not? Though, “custom” might be too grand a word for what amounts to a rather ingenious, if somewhat brazen, form of legalized, or at least tolerated, extortion. One travels to these exotic lands, full of minarets and dusty bazaars, expecting the Orient of storybooks, and, well, you mostly get it. Except the storybooks conveniently forget to mention the outstretched palm, always open, always expectant.

One might be inclined to call it bribery, and indeed, some of the more substantial transactions likely qualify. However, the truly captivating thing about bucksheesh lies in its omnipresence. It’s the gatekeeper expecting a "little something" for opening the gate he was already paid to open. It's the luggage porter insisting upon a "tip" for carrying your valise the twenty feet he's supposed to carry it, and with an expression on his face suggesting you are personally responsible for the famines of the last decade. It is, in essence, a universal lubricant, smoothing the gears of commerce and social interaction – albeit with a rather gritty sound.

It's a system cleverly designed, if I may say, to extract tribute from the gullible tourist. One haggles fiercely for a carpet, managing to whittle the price down to what seems a bargain, only to find oneself surrounded by a chorus of eager hands demanding their share of the supposed "victory." The guide, the donkey driver, the fellow who held the donkey's tail, all lining up like vultures at a forgotten picnic. It’s enough to make one suspect the whole transaction was orchestrated from the beginning, with the tourist cast as the unknowing star of a poorly written farce. And yet, one pays. One pays with a sigh, a chuckle, and a mental note to inflate future travel expenses by a substantial margin. After all, one wouldn’t want to be accused of failing to adequately grease the wheels of the Orient. And besides, as one quickly learns, sometimes a small offering of bucksheesh can accomplish wonders – like securing a decent table, bypassing a bureaucratic hurdle, or simply eliciting a rare, genuine smile. Worth the price, you see, for just a hint of human kindness.
