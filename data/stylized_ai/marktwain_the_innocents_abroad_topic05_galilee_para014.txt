Now, Galilee, bless its heart, is a land that tries its darndest to be impressive, but ends up more like a well-meaning aunt who’s bought you a sweater three sizes too big. You see, it's touted as this place where miracles just sprout like weeds, and where every stone has a story etched into it by the very finger of Providence. And while I wouldn’t dare scoff at tales whispered down through the ages – especially when a good fish dinner hinges on believing them – one can’t help but feel a bit like he's been swindled when the reality hits. The Sea of Galilee, for instance, ain’t no roaring ocean like those back home. It's more like a particularly glum puddle, though prettier, I grant you, than a cow pond in Missouri. Folks row about on it in boats so brightly painted they'd give a peacock a run for its money, hawking trinkets and telling tales taller than the cedars of Lebanon (which, I might add, ain’t as impressive as the pamphlets claim).

The hills, oh, the hills! They heave and roll like a tipsy sailor, dotted with villages that look like they’ve been glued together with mud and hope. The locals are a sturdy lot, mind you, their faces as tanned and weathered as an old saddle, their tongues as quick and lively as a hummingbird’s wings. They'll sell you a rock from Nazareth as a genuine piece of the birthplace (for a small consideration, of course), and you'll buy it, because well, you’ve come this far, haven’t you? One can’t help but suspect that the entire economy of Galilee is based on selling relics to tourists, and a cleverer business plan I’ve yet to see. Still, there's a certain charm to the place, a dusty, sun-baked serenity that seeps into your bones. You’ll leave Galilee feeling a bit disappointed, perhaps, but also strangely…touched. Like that slightly off-key hymn your mother used to sing - not perfect, but undeniably sweet. You’ll remember it long after you’ve forgotten the exorbitant price of that "authentic" Galilean fishing net.
