Now, a sepulchre, you see, ain't just your run-of-the-mill grave, the kind you stumble over in any backwoods churchyard. No sir, a sepulchre is a grave dressed up in Sunday clothes, a tomb that’s put on airs. It's got ambition, that thing, aiming for a grandeur that’s mostly just stone and pretension. I saw one once in Italy, built for some Pope or other, I disremember which – and I wouldn't trust my memory on a thing like that anyway. It was a monstrous affair, all marble curlicues and winged angels frozen mid-sneeze. You could fit a decent-sized saloon inside, and I wager it’d be more comfortable than laying six feet under it, what with the perpetual damp and the whispering ghosts grumbling about the rent.

They say these sepulchres are built to honor the dead, but I reckon they're mostly built to flatter the living. Think about it: who's going to appreciate all that fancy stonework? The corpse? He's too busy fertilizing the worms to care about a Corinthian column. No, these things are for the relatives, the friends, the rubbernecking tourists who come to gawk and whisper about the deceased’s importance, and the family’s wealth. It's a monument to ego, built to last longer than the reputation it attempts to preserve. You ever notice how often the names of the deceased are carved in letters so big and bold, they practically shout? As if the louder they shout, the more likely they are to be remembered. Trouble is, time has a way of quieting those shouts, covering them in moss, and leaving only the stone, a silent testament to a vanity long turned to dust. And some future generation will come along, tourists again, and say, “Well, ain’t that something? I wonder who that feller was?” and then they'll go off for gelato. The sepulchre remains, a lonely, self-important pile, while the memory of the man inside gets swallowed by the ever-hungry maw of history. It's a grand thing, a sepulchre, but mostly grand in its futility, ain’t it? A fancy address for a fella with no forwarding.
