Genoa, bless her barnacled bottom! A city, you say? More like a labyrinth dreamed up by a drunken cartographer with a penchant for staircases and a morbid fear of wide-open spaces. They’ve piled houses upon houses, like so many carelessly stacked playing cards, until the whole shebang threatens to slide into that inky, grasping sea. One might imagine Noah himself, after weathering forty days of Biblical plumbing, would have taken one look at those narrow, twisting alleys and muttered, “Enough water already!” and steered clear. And the smells! Ah, the smells of Genoa could curdle milk at fifty paces. A heady perfume of brine, frying fish that expired yesterday, and something vaguely floral trying valiantly to mask the unmaskable. 

One wanders through these crooked lanes, dodging darting Vespas ridden by fellows who appear to have learned their driving from a particularly aggressive swarm of bees, and you can’t help but feel a bit like a lost tourist in the digestive tract of some enormous, ancient beast. The palazzi, mind you, are grand enough, though often begrimed with the soot of ages and the droppings of pigeons who clearly hold the place in utter contempt. They stand shoulder-to-shoulder, crammed together like anxious gentlemen awaiting their turn at the barber, their facades adorned with faded frescoes that hint at a glorious past, a past now mostly hidden behind lines of laundry flapping in the breeze like distress flags. One catches glimpses of courtyards choked with potted plants and old women gossiping with the ferocity of dockyard parrots. And the Genoese themselves? Sturdy folk, weathered by the sea and suspicious of anyone who smiles too readily. They’ll haggle with you over a handful of olives as if their very lives depended on it, then turn around and give a crust of bread to a mangy stray cat with a tenderness that would melt the heart of a stone gargoyle. A curious people, these Genoese, clinging to their sliver of land between the mountains and the waves, a defiant, pungent, and utterly unforgettable lot.
