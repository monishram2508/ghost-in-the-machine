Gibraltar, bless its stubborn little heart, is a spectacle that fairly shouts, "Look at me! I am a rock, a very important rock, and furthermore, I am British, dash it all!" One approaches it by sea, of course, unless one is some sort of subterranean mole, and the first impression is akin to seeing a colossal, grey lion couchant, guarding the entrance to the Mediterranean. Only this lion has fortifications bristling from its mane like quills on a fretful porcupine. Indeed, it is a veritable geological absurdity, sticking out its chin at Spain as if daring the Iberians to just *try* and reclaim it. And Spain, bless their passionate souls, seems forever on the verge of doing just that, a diplomatic dance of will they/won't they that provides endless amusement to the detached observer.

Inside the town, one finds a charming hodgepodge. Narrow streets that seem barely wide enough for a determined donkey cart, buildings painted in cheery, if somewhat faded, colors, and shopkeepers who somehow manage to speak English with a Spanish lilt and a Cockney disregard for vowels. The place is chock-a-block with tourists, naturally, all eager to be photographed next to a red telephone box with the Rock looming in the background like a disapproving headmaster. And the monkeys! Ah, the Barbary macaques, those impudent little rascals! They are the true lords of Gibraltar, fearlessly snatching sandwiches from unsuspecting travelers and generally conducting themselves with the brazen confidence of creatures who know they are the main attraction. One is told that if the monkeys ever leave Gibraltar, so too will the British. A clever bit of superstition, that, though I suspect the monkeys, shrewd as they are, would be perfectly content to be ruled by anyone who keeps the peanut supply flowing. The whole place, I tell you, is a glorious, improbable, and thoroughly entertaining bit of stagecraft played out on a very large and very stubborn rock. A right rum do, as they say.
