Winter in these here parts, why, it's a thing to behold, I reckon, a regular performance put on by Mother Nature herself, though she ain't exactly known for her subtlety, more like a stagecoach driving through a china shop. You see, the first thing that happens, predictable as a politician's promise, is this snow. It comes down in flakes so big, you'd think the angels were having a pillow fight up yonder. At first, it's pretty, mind you, all glittery and fresh-like, covering up the ugliness of the world like a fresh coat of paint on a dilapidated saloon. Folks get all sentimental and start talking about "winter wonderlands" and "picturesque landscapes." Give it a week, though.

Then that "picturesque" snow turns into a dirty, slushy mess, the color of a miner's wash water. The horses, bless their thick hides, slip and slide like they're auditioning for a low-comedy act, and the sidewalks become a treacherous obstacle course, best navigated with crampons and a prayer. And the cold? Why, it's a cold that'll seep right into your bones and settle in for the duration, like a freeloading relative you can't shake loose. You try wrapping yourself in enough layers to resemble a stuffed bear, but that wind, that ornery cuss, finds a way to sneak in and nip at you anyway, turning your nose redder than a drunkard's and your ears so numb you could lose 'em without noticing. The days shrink shorter than a gambler's luck, and the nights get longer than a preacher's sermon. Folks huddle by their fires, grumbling about the woodpile and the price of flour, dreaming of the day when that blasted sun decides to make a comeback and thaw out this frozen purgatory. Yep, winter, she's a character, all right – a long, drawn-out, frostbitten character, and I swear, some years she overstays her welcome like a traveling salesman with a tall tale and an empty wallet.
