Winters in Nevada, bless their frosted whiskers, are a spectacle worthy of a ten-cent opera, only without the melodious screeching. You wouldn’t think much of 'em at first blush, just a bit of nip in the air, a sprinkling of sugar-dust on the mountains, and a general hushing of the wind like a bored gambler finally folding his hand. Then BAM! Like a mule kicking you square in the suspenders, it hits. Suddenly, that “nip” is a biting, snarling beast, tearing at your whiskers and leaving you looking like a frosted scarecrow. The “sugar-dust” has become a six-foot blanket of the stuff, burying everything prettier than a politician’s promise. And the wind? Well, the wind howls like a banshee who’s just lost her rent money, carrying snowflakes sharp as glass and cold enough to freeze the very words in your mouth.

Now, some folks wax poetic about the “serene beauty” of a winter landscape. Serene? Tell that to the poor jackrabbit trying to dig himself out of a snowdrift! Tell it to the miner whose claim is now buried under more white stuff than a baker's convention! No sir, there ain’t nothing serene about it unless you're the hibernating sort, and even then, I reckon you'd be dreaming about spring. The towns get quiet, except for the occasional crash of a snow-laden roof caving in, and the saloons get busier, filled with fellas swapping tall tales about blizzards past, each one bigger and more ferocious than the last. It’s a time for cabin fever and questionable beard-grooming choices, a season where the only thing moving faster than the snow is the dwindling supply of whiskey. It's a grand old time, I suppose, if you've got a good fire, a strong constitution, and a healthy sense of the absurd, because Lord knows, you'll need it.
