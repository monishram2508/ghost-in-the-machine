Now, this glacier, bless its heart, it's a sight to behold, if you've got a geological sort of leaning, which Eve hasn’t much of, truth be told. It's like a river, see, only instead of water, it's made of ice, and instead of rushin' and frothin' and gettin' into mischief like any self-respectin' river should, it’s pokin' along slower than Adam tryin' to figure out the difference between a turnip and a rock. It does move, mind you, but you wouldn't notice it unless you marked it with a particularly stubborn pebble and then came back a week later, just to find the pebble had finally given up the fight and let itself be lugged down the hill a foot or two. 

The local folk, they say it's been crawlin' down that mountain for centuries, which, considerin' the speed, ain't hard to believe. Adam thinks it's a grand spectacle of nature's handiwork, says it’s carving valleys and depositing rocks hither and yon, like a giant, if particularly sluggish, sculptor. I reckon nature's got better things to do than spend eons pushin' rocks around, but I keep that to myself. Point is, it’s a big, blue, frozen thing, and it's leakin' water like a sieve with a head-cold. All that meltin' water is runnin' down and creatin' a lake, which Adam is currently tryin' to convince me is a fine place to try out his new raft. Now, I told him, I said, "Adam, darlin', you go right ahead and build your raft, but I ain't settin' foot on anything that close to that chilly behemoth until it's at least shed a layer or two." I've got a hunch, that glacier is gonna be around for a while, and I'm in no particular hurry to catch a cold just to admire it a little closer. A woman's got to have some sense about these things.
