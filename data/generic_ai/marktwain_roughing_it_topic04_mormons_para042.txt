The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian faith that began in the United States in the 19th century. Central to Mormon belief is the Book of Mormon, which they believe to be another testament of Jesus Christ and a companion scripture to the Bible. It recounts the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who received visits from Jesus Christ after his resurrection. The faith's origins trace back to Joseph Smith, who, according to Mormon doctrine, received divine visitations from God the Father and Jesus Christ, as well as angelic ministrations from figures like Moroni, who revealed the location of the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. These foundational events led to the organization of the church in 1830.

Mormon theology diverges from traditional Protestant and Catholic doctrines in several key aspects. They believe in continuing revelation, the idea that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets today, with the church president regarded as the living prophet. Temple worship plays a significant role in Mormon religious life, with temples considered sacred houses of the Lord where specific ordinances are performed, including baptisms for the dead, sealings of families for eternity, and endowments that provide members with greater understanding of God's plan. A strong emphasis is placed on family, and members are encouraged to marry and raise children within the faith. Missionary work is another defining characteristic, with young men and women often serving full-time, voluntary missions, typically for two years, to share their beliefs with others worldwide. The church also promotes a health code known as the Word of Wisdom, which encourages abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, and emphasizes a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The church is organized hierarchically, with local congregations overseen by bishops, and regional and global leadership provided by apostles and the First Presidency.
