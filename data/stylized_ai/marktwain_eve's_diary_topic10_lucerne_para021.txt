Lucerne, you see, is one of them Swiss towns, nestled alongside a lake so blue it makes a robin’s egg look positively jaundiced. And picturesque? Good heavens, the word itself practically crawls on its knees to be associated. Why, if scenery were currency, Lucerne could buy up all the rest of Europe and have enough left over for a vacation in the Sandwich Islands. They’ve got mountains poking at the sky like impatient children demanding attention, and a bridge, the Kapellbrücke, painted all over with pictures of fellas doing brave deeds and dames looking forlorn – history, I suppose, though I reckon half the stories are made up whole cloth after a stein or two of that local lager. It’s the sort of place that makes a body want to sigh dramatically and ponder the mysteries of the universe, though I generally prefer to ponder the mysteries of a well-cooked trout.

The town is plumb full of tourists, naturally. Seemingly everyone with a hankering for cuckoo clocks and yodeling has gravitated there. They stroll around with maps the size of bedsheets, looking perpetually lost and occasionally stopping to snap a photograph of a particularly impressive pigeon. The local merchants, bless their conniving hearts, are more than happy to accommodate their needs, selling overpriced souvenirs and charging enough for a cup of coffee to finance a small principality. But you can't fault 'em; a body’s gotta eat. The women, bless their generous souls, adorn their shop windows with all kinds of irresistible trinkets and treasures; which a fella always has to pretend he isn't the slightest bit interested in. I suspect a lot of it is just window dressing, meant to lure you in and then sell you something you don’t need but feel obliged to purchase anyhow. And, as for the men, they keep the wheels of industry turning, polishing the already pristine streets and muttering about the price of cheese under their breath. All in all, it's a sight to behold, Lucerne, even if half of it’s as contrived as a politician’s smile. Still, sometimes a fella just needs a little contrived beauty in his life, even if it cost him a small fortune.
