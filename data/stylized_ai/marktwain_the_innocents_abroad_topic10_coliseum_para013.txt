Ah, the Coliseum, that venerable old ruin – a monstrous, circular absurdity, to be sure. I’ve seen barns in Missouri with more architectural grace, though I concede they lack the certain panache that comes with having been soaked in enough blood to float a respectable riverboat. One imagines the Romans, those fellows with their togas and questionable plumbing, gathered here with a bloodthirsty glee that would make a Mississippi gambler blush. They’d come, not to admire the craftsmanship (which, let’s be honest, ain’t exactly the Sistine Chapel), but to watch some poor devil of a gladiator get his clock cleaned by a lion with a rather obvious case of indigestion.

And the crowds! One can almost hear them now, a baying mob of humanity, their thumbs pointing hither and yon, deciding who lived and who ended up as a lion’s midnight snack. A democracy of death, you might say, though I reckon the gladiators themselves had precious little say in the matter. I suppose, in a way, it's a grand testament to human depravity – a monument to the fact that a fella will pay good money to watch another fella get mauled, especially if he's had a bit too much wine. The echoes of those roars still linger, you know, a ghostly chorus of bloodlust that hums in the very stones.

Nowadays, it's all tourists, of course, snapping pictures and dropping ice cream wrappers, a far cry from the lions and the lances of yore. They stand there, blinking in the Italian sun, trying to imagine the carnage. I daresay, most of them fail. They see the picturesque ruin, the romantic decay, but they miss the point entirely. They forget that this wasn't just a stage, it was a meat grinder, a lesson in the ephemeral nature of fame, and a rather persuasive argument against challenging a lion to a wrestling match. Still, it makes for a mighty fine backdrop for a selfie, don’t it?
