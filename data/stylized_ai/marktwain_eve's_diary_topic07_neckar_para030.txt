The Neckar, you see, is a river with a name that sounds suspiciously like a cough a consumptive might produce, a point I’ve made to many a good German, earning me only glares and muttered pronouncements about American humor being… different. But I maintain, a river deserves a name that doesn’t remind one of a lingering demise. Still, the Neckar it is, and a rather agreeable river at that, if one can overlook the occasional barge chugging past with the grace of a walrus attempting ballet. I floated down it myself some years back, in a contraption that resembled more a leaky bathtub than a proper vessel, and nearly ended up as carp fodder near Heidelberg. The currents, while not precisely Niagara-esque, possess a certain slyness, a trickery that delights in nudging the unwary toward the shallows, where the mud clings to one's boots with the tenacity of a lovesick maiden.

And Heidelberg, ah, Heidelberg! A picture postcard town, I confess, though overly fond of its castle. One would think they had single-handedly invented the thing, the way they harp on about it. Pretty ruin it is, to be sure, but ruins are ruins, and I’ve seen better crumbling edifices in my day, thank you very much. The river itself reflects the castle’s grandeur, or what’s left of it, in a way that is either deeply poetic or merely a convenient way for the townsfolk to avoid cleaning their windows. Upstream, the valley opens into vineyards that appear to have been planted on the side of a cliff by goats wearing tiny sombreros. The wine produced from these precarious grapes is, naturally, deemed exceptional, though I suspect half the flavor comes from the sheer terror of harvesting the wretched things. All in all, the Neckar's a decent sort of river, full of character, even if its character is sometimes a bit… damp. Just try not to fall in, unless you have a particular fondness for mud and the company of bottom-feeding fish.
