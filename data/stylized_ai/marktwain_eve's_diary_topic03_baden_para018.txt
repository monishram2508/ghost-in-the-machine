Baden-Baden, you say? Ah, yes, the haunt of dukes and dubious countesses, a place where the air itself smells of perfume and promissory notes. I spent a bit of time there, some years back, attempting to decipher the allure of a place that seemed dedicated to gilding the lily. The grand promenade, the Lichtentaler Allee, stretched out like a silken ribbon, perpetually crowded with the best-dressed folk in Europe, all apparently engaged in a silent competition to see who could look the most bored. And the waters, those famed thermal springs! One would think bathing in hot, sulfuric water would be a penance, but no, here it was a luxury, something to be discussed with breathless reverence as if one were describing the nectar of the gods. I even attempted a soak myself, though I emerged smelling vaguely of rotten eggs and feeling only slightly cleaner than before. But the Kursaal, now that's a sight to behold. A glittering palace dedicated to the worship of Lady Luck, where fortunes are won and lost with alarming ease. I observed a gentleman, looking as though he had just inherited the entire continent, stake his wealth on a single spin of the roulette wheel, his face a mask of nonchalance. He lost, of course, and his face promptly resembled a spoiled custard. One could almost feel sorry for the poor chap, but there was a certain theatricality to it all that made it difficult to take too seriously. And the restaurants! Ah, the endless parade of courses, each more elaborately constructed than the last, a culinary ballet performed by armies of waiters. One could spend an entire day simply eating, and I confess, I came dangerously close to doing just that. Baden-Baden, a place for the idle rich, the health-obsessed, and anyone who enjoys watching other people’s money evaporate into thin air. A glittering facade, perhaps, but underneath, a place that understands the delightful absurdity of the human condition.
