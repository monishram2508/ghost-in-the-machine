Lucerne, bless its heart, is one of those places that sits right pretty on the postcard, all framed by those Alps that look like they've been dusted with confectioner's sugar by a particularly enthusiastic giant. And mind you, the town itself ain't ugly either. The buildings are all prim and proper, like they're perpetually dressed for church. There's a covered bridge there, the Kapellbrücke, and they say it’s the oldest in Europe, though I reckon they've patched it up so many times it’s probably got more new wood than old. Still, it’s a fetching thing, unless you get to thinking too much about all the heads they lopped off on that Rathausquai. The stories that stones could tell, eh?

Now, the lake, that’s a beauty. Clear as gin on a winter’s day and ringed with steamboats puffing around like busy little beetles. You can take a ride on one, and I recommend it. If you don't, you’re liable to get run over by all the tourists, and you'll be wishing you were on the boat. Speaking of tourists, I do believe half the population of Japan has spent an afternoon snapping photographs of that lion carved into the rock face. The Löwendenkmal, they call it. It's supposed to be a monument to some Swiss Guards who got themselves killed in France. Pathetic looking thing, really, all mournful and stuck. I did chuckle to myself, thinking about the poor chaps having their sacrifice permanently immortalized, petrified in stone like a very expensive paperweight.

But all in all, Lucerne is charming enough. Not quite the heart of Switzerland, more like the frilly petticoat, if you catch my drift. A body could happily waste a few days there, sopping up the scenery and trying not to think too hard about the price of fondue. Just don’t expect to find any real adventure. Lucerne is the kind of place where the biggest excitement is spotting a cat napping in a window box. And you know, sometimes, that’s exactly what a body needs. A bit of peace, a bit of pretty, and a whole lot of cheese.
