The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian denomination that originated in the United States during the 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith, the church posits that the Bible is not the only divinely inspired scripture, but that other texts, particularly the Book of Mormon, are equally important and provide further insight into God's will and humanity's purpose. This foundational text, according to Mormon belief, recounts the history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. Mormons believe that the original Christian church fell into apostasy, losing its original doctrines and authority, and that Joseph Smith was chosen by God to restore the true church through divine revelations and angelic visitations, including receiving the gold plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon. A key aspect of Mormon theology is the concept of continuing revelation, suggesting that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets in the present day, guiding the church and its members. Mormons adhere to a unique set of doctrines concerning the nature of God, the plan of salvation, and the afterlife. They believe in a God who is a tangible, glorified being, that individuals existed as spirits before birth, and that families can be eternally sealed together through temple ordinances. Missionary work plays a crucial role in the church, with young men and women serving voluntary missions worldwide, spreading the message of the restored gospel. Mormon temples are sacred structures distinct from regular meetinghouses, where members participate in ordinances such as baptisms for the dead and eternal marriage ceremonies. Community and family are highly valued within Mormon culture, fostering a strong sense of belonging and mutual support among members. The church encourages a strict moral code, emphasizing honesty, chastity, and abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. While once controversial for its practice of polygamy, the Church officially discontinued it in 1890, though splinter groups who still practice it do exist. Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a global organization with millions of members worldwide, actively engaged in humanitarian efforts and promoting its religious beliefs through various channels.
