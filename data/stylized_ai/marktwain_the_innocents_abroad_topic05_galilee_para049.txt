Now, Galilee. A region, I tell you, so fertile it practically jumps into your basket of its own accord. A fellow could trip over olives there if he wasn't careful, and figs practically beg to be eaten, plump and juicy as a politician’s promises before an election. They call it the "Jewel of the North," and bless my soul, they ain't far wrong. 'Course, jewels get you robbed these days, and Galilee has seen her share of thievery and rascality throughout history, much like any other place where folks got something worth stealing. I rode through the valleys, you see, and even the hillsides seemed to hum with stories – some whispered on the wind, others shouted from the crumbling stones of old synagogues. Nazareth, a sleepy little village, is there, where, if the stories be true, our savior spent his boyhood; hard to imagine such a place producing such a figure, it's so quiet you could hear a locust clear its throat a mile away. The Sea of Galilee, though, that's another matter entirely. A body of water so blue it could make a sapphire blush, and so teeming with fish, why, you could practically walk across its surface on the backs of the silver fellows. I saw fishermen there, tough as nails and brown as walnuts, hauling in nets brimming with their bounty. But don’t you go believing everything you hear about them walking on the water; I assure you, no matter how holy the fisherman, he’s got a boat. I tried my hand at angling, naturally, but the fish of Galilee, bless their finny little hearts, were far too sophisticated for my simple bait. They likely took one look at my efforts and swam off, chuckling to themselves at the absurdity of it all. Still, it was a pleasant enough day, watching the sun glint off the water, the air thick with the smell of fish and the faint scent of orange blossoms. A man could do worse than to spend his days in Galilee, even if he couldn’t catch a single fish. The only trouble is, I've a suspicion that all the best stories have already been wrung out of that place. Still, if you listen carefully, you might just hear the echo of a miracle or two.
