Now, Morgan, there was a specimen. Not a rare one, mind you, not like finding a nugget the size of your fist, but a common enough variety, like dust devils across the alkali flats. Morgan was a mule-skinner, of the sort that could swear a blue streak that’d curdle milk ten miles downwind, and then turn around and sing hymns at a revival meeting like an angel – a fallen one, perhaps, given the aforementioned swearing. He weren’t much to look at, neither; all elbows and knees, with a face like a dried apple and a beard that looked like it’d been assembled by birds out of stray bits of twine and tumbleweeds. But bless my boots, that man could handle a team of mules like nobody’s business. Why, I saw him once, with a string of stubborn critters dug in deeper than a tick on a hound dog, and he didn’t raise his voice above a polite suggestion. He just looked at them with those squinty eyes of his, like he knew every single one of their dirty little secrets, and those mules, shamefaced as you please, just straightened up and hauled.

He claimed he learned the trick from an old Paiute shaman, though I suspect it was more likely he simply had the stubbornness beat out of him as a boy and figured he might as well put it to use. Morgan wasn't much for conversation, preferring the company of his mules and a plug of tobacco, but when he did speak, it was usually something dry and humorous, like a lizard warming itself on a sun-baked rock. One time, a tenderfoot asked him how to tell the difference between a mule and a jackass. Morgan just squinted, spat a brown stream into the dust, and drawled, "Well, son, the mule's the one pulling the load, and the jackass is the one telling him how to do it." And that, I reckon, summed up half the population of Nevada right there. A peculiar character, Morgan, but a man you could depend on, which, out in the wilderness, was worth more than all the gold in the Comstock Lode.
