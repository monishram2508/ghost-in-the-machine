Well, I reckon I've seen glaciers aplenty in my time, though perhaps not so many as Adam, who, bless his simple heart, seems to think the entire world is made of ice and populated by penguins with a fondness for philosophical debates. A glacier, you see, ain't just a big lump of ice like you might find floating in your lemonade – though a glacier in one’s lemonade would certainly be a spectacle to behold, wouldn't it? No, a glacier is more like a river that's taken a notion to lie down and have a good long nap, a nap that might last a few thousand years or so. It moves, mind you, ever so slow, like a snail with a serious case of the gout. It grinds along, carving valleys and leaving behind all sorts of mess – rocks, dirt, the odd woolly mammoth bone, whatever struck its fancy as it shuffled past.

And the color of it! Some folks say it's blue, and I suppose if you squint just right and catch the sun at a particular angle, it might be. But mostly it's just dirty. Disappointingly so, if you ask me. One expects something so grand and ancient to be a bit more presentable, perhaps with a little spit and polish. But no, it’s all mud and gravel clinging to its sides like a lovesick bulldog. But then again, maybe that’s its charm. It’s honest. It doesn’t pretend to be anything it isn't. It's just a big, slow, messy, and rather grumpy river of ice, doing its thing. And I suppose there's a certain poetry in that, even if Adam doesn't see it. He’s too busy trying to invent ice skates out of dinosaur ribs, which, by the way, strikes me as an entirely unnecessary expenditure of effort, considering he can barely stand upright on dry land. The man has ideas, I'll give him that. Just not always good ones.
