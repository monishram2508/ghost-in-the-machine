Naples, ah, Naples! A city that looks as though it were designed by a drunken architect with a penchant for the Baroque and a deep, abiding affection for haphazardness. One half expects Mount Vesuvius to clear its throat and declare the whole enterprise a jest, and perhaps it is, but a most entertaining jest indeed. I've seen streets narrower than a politician's promise, and as crooked as their dealings, choked with a teeming mass of humanity, donkeys piled high with produce, and swarthy fellows hawking wares that looked suspiciously like things they’d only just liberated from some unsuspecting tourist. The laundry, bless its heart, hangs strung across these lanes like victory banners celebrating perpetual disarray. One wonders if the Neapolitans ever actually enter their houses, for they seem to exist exclusively in the street, gesticulating wildly, arguing with the passion of operatic tenors, and somehow managing to conduct commerce, family dramas, and religious observances all at the same time, and all within the confines of a space barely large enough to accommodate a well-fed cat.

The city is layered like an onion, peel back one stratum and you’ll find another, each redolent with the aroma of antiquity, decay, and Vesuvian ash. One stumbles across ancient Roman ruins whilst dodging speeding Vespas, a juxtaposition so ludicrous it quite took my breath away, almost as much as the driving. And the food! Ah, the food of Naples! One could write a book thicker than Gibbon’s on the subject, detailing the pizzas, the pastas, the pastries that seem to spring forth from the very cobblestones. Though I confess, I developed a healthy respect for their method of judging ripeness in tomatoes – a robust squeeze followed by a shouted proclamation that could shatter a glass. But fear not, the tomato survived the indignity, and found its way into a sauce so heavenly it made me briefly consider renouncing my American citizenship and becoming a Neapolitan myself, though I suspect they already have enough citizens to be getting on with. All in all, Naples is a magnificent spectacle, a glorious mess, a city that seems determined to defy logic and charm you into submission, and by Jove, it succeeds rather admirably.
