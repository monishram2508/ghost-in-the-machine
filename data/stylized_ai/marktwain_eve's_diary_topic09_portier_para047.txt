The portier, now, there’s a thing that’s just begging for a good ribbing, wouldn’t you say? A curtain, essentially, pretending to be something more. Calling itself a ‘portier’ instead of a ‘door-drape,’ as if a fancy name can hide the truth of its flimsiness. It hangs there, all heavy velvet or some such frippery, trying to lend an air of Importance to the space it guards – as if it were barring entry to the Queen of Sheba herself, rather than the draft from the hallway or, more likely, Cousin Mildred's dreadful singing practices. I swear, I’ve seen more resistance from a wet napkin clinging to a washboard.

And the purpose! Ah, that's where the true comedy lies. The portier is meant to keep out the cold, they say. And I suppose, in theory, it manages to do just that, about as effectively as I keep out the temptation to sample the gingerbread cookies when cook isn't looking. It's a grand illusion, you see, because the air, being no fool, simply goes around the sides, or under it, or even right through it, if the weave is loose enough. The only thing the portier effectively keeps out is a decent view of the other room, which, come to think of it, might be its most noble purpose after all. Perhaps it's hiding something ghastly, like Uncle Silas trying to dance the polka again after far too much dandelion wine. 

Then there’s the sheer pretension of it all! Imagine, a curtain thinking itself worthy of replacing a proper door! Why, it’s as ridiculous as a cat trying to conduct an orchestra, or a Congressman telling the truth. It sways and rustles in the breeze, trying to convey an air of mystery and elegance, while all the while, it’s just a piece of fabric doing its darnedest to look useful. It reminds me of a fop, all puffed up with self-importance, who can't light a fire to save his life. I wager, give me a choice between a stout oaken door and a portier, and I'd take the door every time. At least, the door knows its place.
