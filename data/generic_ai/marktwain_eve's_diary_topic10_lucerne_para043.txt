Lucerne, also commonly known as alfalfa, stands as a globally significant forage crop revered for its exceptional nutritional value and versatility in agricultural systems. This perennial legume, scientifically classified as *Medicago sativa*, is distinguished by its deep root system, which allows it to access water and nutrients from significant depths within the soil profile, contributing to its drought tolerance and soil-improving qualities. Typically growing to a height of one to three feet, lucerne boasts trifoliate leaves and characteristic purple flowers, although variations in flower color ranging from blue to yellow can occur. Its cultivation is widespread across diverse climates, from temperate regions to semi-arid landscapes, reflecting its adaptability and resilience. Farmers prize lucerne for its high protein content, making it an ideal feed source for livestock, particularly dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, and horses. It’s regularly conserved as hay, silage, or processed into lucerne meal, providing a consistent and readily available feedstuff throughout the year.

Beyond its nutritional benefits for animals, lucerne contributes significantly to soil health. Its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, achieved through a symbiotic relationship with *Rhizobium* bacteria in the root nodules, enrich the soil with essential nitrogen, reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. The deep root system further enhances soil structure by improving aeration and water infiltration, mitigating soil erosion and promoting overall soil fertility. As a result, lucerne is often incorporated into crop rotations as a green manure crop, preceding other crops like cereals or vegetables, to improve yields and reduce reliance on synthetic inputs. Furthermore, lucerne plays a vital role in sustainable agriculture by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil, mitigating the effects of climate change. Its importance extends beyond the agricultural realm, as lucerne sprouts are consumed by humans as a nutritious addition to salads and sandwiches, offering a source of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. The multifaceted benefits of lucerne make it an indispensable component of modern agricultural practices, contributing to both animal nutrition and environmental sustainability.
