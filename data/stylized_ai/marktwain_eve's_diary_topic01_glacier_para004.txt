Now, concerning glaciers, a body of ice that's seemingly got all the time in the world, I must confess, they hold a certain fascination for a simple creature like myself. Adam, of course, being ever the practical one, deems them “cold rocks what melt slow”. Men! He has no poetry in his soul, that one. I wouldn’t be surprised if he thought the Milky Way was just spilled milk from some celestial cow. But I digress. A glacier, you see, it's like a river, but instead of rushing along all boisterous and showing off, it moves with the pace of a snail on a Sunday picnic. Why, I swear I’ve seen dandelions grow faster.

They tell you glaciers are mighty sculptors of the land, carving out valleys and leaving behind great heaps of gravel, which Adam calls “more rocks”. It's all very impressive, I suppose, if one is impressed by something taking millions of years to achieve what a good thunderstorm could manage in an afternoon. But the sheer bulk of them! Like a giant blue tongue sticking out from the mountains, tasting the sun. And they do taste the sun, for all their cold demeanor. I’ve seen little streams running across them, crystal clear and singing a song only the rocks can understand, all thanks to the sun's flirtations. It’s a bit scandalous, if you ask me, this carrying on with the sun, but I suppose a glacier gets lonely after a few millennia of the same scenery. They also have this habit of dropping great chunks of themselves into the water with a boom that scares the fishes half to death. Adam assures me it's just physics, not some display of glacier pique at the sun's advances, but I'm not so sure. Perhaps, just perhaps, they're throwing a bit of shade, if you will, in the form of a very large ice cube. In any case, they're rather majestic, even if they are taking their own sweet time about everything. One has to admire such dedication, even if it’s dedicated to being exceptionally slow.
