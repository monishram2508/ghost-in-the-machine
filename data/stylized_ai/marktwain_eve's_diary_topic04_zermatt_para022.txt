Zermatt, you say? Well, bless my spectacles, I reckon I've seen fleas on a dog with more going on than that little hamlet. Picture this, if you will: a postcard come to life, all snowy peaks and chalet rooftops jammed so close they're practically gossiping with one another about who's got the fanciest window boxes. And the air! So clean, it fair tickles your lungs and makes you want to apologize for ever breathing in anything less pure. The only trouble is, that purity comes at a price. Every conveyance is electric, mind you, those little buggies buzzing about like angry bumblebees powered by lightning bugs. It’s a clever idea, I suppose, all in the name of keeping the air pristine for those dainty tourists, but it does rather take the fun out of things. Where's the charm, I ask you, without the belching smoke of a good old steam engine?

And the Matterhorn! Oh, the Matterhorn. It’s there, alright, looming over the town like a grumpy old grandfather who disapproves of all the merry-making. Majestic, they call it. I say it’s just a big rock, though a big rock that's seen more sunsets than you or I ever will. The villagers are quite proud of it, naturally, and have built the whole confounded town around making sure you get a good view from every conceivable angle. One might think they invented mountains, the way they carry on. But frankly, after you’ve seen one mountain, you’ve seen 'em all, give or take a stray goat or two. And the tourists, bless their simple hearts, they flock to it like moths to a lamp, snapping pictures and uttering hushed reverences. They look so pleased with themselves, as if they’ve personally discovered the wonders of nature. It's enough to make a body chuckle, I tell you, just watching the human comedy unfold against the backdrop of that oversized pointy rock. All in all, Zermatt's a pleasant enough place, if you've a fondness for perfectly ordered scenery and a strong constitution for avoiding anything remotely resembling excitement.
