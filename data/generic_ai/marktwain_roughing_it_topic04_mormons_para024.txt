The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, emerged in the United States during the 19th century under the leadership of Joseph Smith. Smith claimed to have received visitations from God and Jesus Christ, as well as an angel named Moroni, who directed him to a set of golden plates. These plates, translated by Smith, became the Book of Mormon, considered scripture alongside the Bible. This foundational text narrates a history of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection. A central tenet of Mormon belief is the doctrine of continuing revelation, the idea that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets in modern times. This distinguishes them from many other Christian denominations that believe revelation ceased with the early apostles. Early Mormons faced significant persecution due to their unique beliefs and practices, including polygamy, which was publicly practiced for a time but officially discontinued in 1890. This led to a series of migrations, most notably to the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah, where they established a thriving community and built their central temple. Today, the Church is a global organization with millions of members worldwide. They are known for their strong emphasis on family values, missionary work, and community involvement. Mormon theology encompasses a belief in a pre-mortal existence, the importance of ordinances and covenants in achieving salvation, and the potential for eternal progression. The Church operates a vast welfare system to assist members in need and actively participates in humanitarian efforts globally. While adhering to core Christian principles such as the divinity of Jesus Christ and the importance of the Atonement, Mormon doctrine diverges from traditional Christian theology in its understanding of the Godhead, the nature of humanity, and the plan of salvation. The Church also has a strong emphasis on temple worship, where sacred ordinances are performed for the living and the dead.
