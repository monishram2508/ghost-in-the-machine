Baden, ah Baden, that place of waters and whispers. One could fancy it a gilded cage for the gouty, a retreat designed solely for the purging of over-indulgent livers and the rattling of jewelry. The Kurhaus, a veritable temple to idleness, sprawls like a bored cat in the sun, its frescoed ceilings gazing down upon a perpetual parade of powdered faces and dubious mustaches. One witnesses fortunes won and lost at roulette tables faster than a vicar can mispronounce the Nicene Creed – fortunes, mind you, often gained by the same unscrupulous methods they were lost. The air hangs thick with the scent of floral perfume, mingled with the faint, yet undeniable, odor of sulfur. For even the roses here seem to be attempting to mask something, though I can't rightly say what.

The townsfolk, bless their industrious hearts, are ever eager to separate the wealthy visitor from his coin. Little shops line the streets, overflowing with trinkets and baubles of questionable artistry, each one hawked with an enthusiasm that could launch a steamboat. And the waiters! Those paragons of attentiveness, they hover like vultures above a wounded gazelle, ready to swoop in with a bill that could rival the national debt of a small, struggling kingdom. The very pigeons, plump and insolent, seem to be in on the game, strutting about with an air of entitlement, daring you to begrudge them a crumb.

Still, I confess a certain fondness for the place. There's a peculiar charm in watching the wealthy attempt to appear bored amidst such orchestrated opulence. And the Black Forest, lurking just beyond the manicured gardens, offers a welcome escape from the gilded cage. One can wander amongst its ancient trees, and almost, but not quite, forget that one is merely a cog in the great, glittering, and slightly absurd machine that is Baden. And besides, even Eve herself would appreciate the opportunity to try on a new bonnet, and perhaps, just perhaps, win back a few marks at the roulette table before the sun sets.
