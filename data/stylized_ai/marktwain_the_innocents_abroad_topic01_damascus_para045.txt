Now, Damascus. A city they call ancient, and bless my soul, I reckon they ain't lying. Why, they claim it's been inhabited since Methuselah was cutting his teeth, and while I haven't personally interviewed old Methuselah to confirm, I wouldn’t put it past ‘em. They say even Cain, after that unfortunate incident with his brother, might have popped in for a bit of couscous. Of course, back then I imagine the couscous wasn’t quite as…reassuring.

The air, thick as molasses in January, hangs heavy with the perfume of jasmine, the aroma of roasted lamb, and just a wee whisper of something vaguely unpleasant that I charitably attribute to ancient drainage schemes. Mind you, it adds character, just like a few well-placed wrinkles add charm to a seasoned gambler's face. The streets, now they're something else. A tangled web of alleys narrower than a miser’s heart, teeming with merchants hawking everything from shimmering silks to suspiciously cheap spices. I swear, I saw a man selling what he claimed were genuine Roman coins, but the wear and tear suggested they'd been minted just last Tuesday, and aged with a hammer and a handful of dirt.

The people, ah, the Damascenes. Sharp as tacks, they are, and just as likely to stick you if you’re not paying attention. They haggle with the ferocity of a cornered badger, and a smile can mean anything from genuine warmth to a cunning plan to fleece you blind. But they possess a hospitality that’ll shame a Southern gentleman. Offer you tea even if they’re about to debate with you the price of something, in a way where you're not sure if they're inviting you in for tea, or using it as a means to soften you up for the inevitable sale of a carpet.

And then there's the Damascus steel. Now, that’s a legend in itself. They say they know the secret to making blades strong enough to cleave a silk scarf floating in the air. Though, between you and me, I reckon that scarf had been dipped in something considerably stiffer than the average lady's fan before being sent airborn. I imagine the secret is locked away in the tomb, guarded by a djinn and a particularly grumpy camel, never to be revealed to us clumsy folk. Still, a man can dream, can't he? As long as he remembers to hold onto his purse while he’s dreaming it.
