Slade, now there's a town that could make a mule trader blush. Situated on the banks of the Kentucky River, it ain't exactly what you'd call a metropolis, more of a scattering of shacks and saloons flung together like a drunken card player's discarded hand. I reckon a stray dog could navigate the main street faster than a politician making promises. The mud there is thicker than molasses in January, and if you ain't careful, you'll find yourself sunk to your ankles, wishing you'd invested in a pair of stilts instead of that questionable-looking whisky at O'Malley's.

The folks there, well, they're a peculiar bunch, hardy as hickory and suspicious as a cat near a hound dog. You could tell them a snake oil salesman had started dispensing gold bricks for a nickel apiece, and they'd likely just squint, chew on their tobacco, and ask if the bricks were properly assayed. Not easily fooled, these mountain men, though prone to a good yarn and a tall tale around a crackling fire. Their humor is dryer than a dust storm in the Sahara, and their hospitality is as warm as a wool blanket on a cold night, provided you ain't wearing shoes that cost more than their entire cabin.

I saw one fella there, name of Jedediah, tried to sell me a "genuine" dinosaur tooth he claimed he'd found while plowing his field. Said it belonged to a "Tyrannosaurus Rex," though I suspect he'd never even heard of such a critter, let alone excavated its choppers. I told him I'd give him two bits for it, figuring it might make a decent paperweight, but he huffed and puffed, declaring it was worth at least a dollar, maybe even two if I was feeling generous. I left him to his palaeontological pursuits, figuring the tooth was probably just a chipped bit of limestone, and he'd be better off selling it as a cure for gout to some unsuspecting city slicker. Slade, you see, is a place where opportunity knocks, but often it's wearing a false beard and selling questionable merchandise.
