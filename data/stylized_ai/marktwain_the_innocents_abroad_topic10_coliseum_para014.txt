Now, about this Coliseum, or as the Romans, in their flamboyant way, called it, the Amphitheatrum Flavium – fancy names they had for everything, didn't they? More syllables than sense, I always say. A colossal affair, this thing, enough to make a prairie dog feel insignificant, which, considering the prairie dog’s usual posture, is saying something. They claim Vespasian started it, and Titus finished it, though whether they were working together or just arguing about the placement of the vomitoria (essential exits, you see, for a hasty retreat after a particularly dull gladiatorial bout), history conveniently omits. 

They say it could hold fifty-thousand Romans, all jostling for the best view of a chap getting skewered by a trident. Makes you wonder what they did for entertainment before such civilized pursuits came along, probably just arguing over who had the largest toga, I reckon. Imagine the vendor's market, though! "Get your lion-flavored ices, folks! Souvenirs of suffering! Freshly sharpened swords, buy one, get a gladiator free!" I daresay the noise alone was enough to rattle your teeth. 

They staged everything here, from the killing of Christians – a rather unsporting affair, if you ask me, considering they were mostly pacifists – to mock naval battles, for which they flooded the entire arena. Flooding Rome seems a bit much just for some watery entertainment, but I suppose they had slaves aplenty to bail it all out afterward. The whole place reeks of spectacle, of an empire showing off, like a feller with a brand-new gold watch waving it in your face every five minutes. It's impressive, aye, but also a tad vulgar. After all, a fellow doesn't need to see blood and guts to know he's alive, does he? Or perhaps, back then, they did. Humanity, you see, has always found rather imaginative ways to confirm its own mortality. A bit morbid if you think about it, but as I always say, better to laugh than to cry...especially when faced with a ravenous lion.
