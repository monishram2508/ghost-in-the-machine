Now, Pard, that’s a peculiar word, ain't it? "Pard." Sounds like something you'd scrape off your boot after a particularly unfortunate stroll through a cow pasture. But out here in Nevada, see, back when civilization was still tiptoeing across the Rockies like a skittish mule, "pard" was a word tossed around more freely than a gambler's luck. It meant partner, friend, compadre, the fella you'd share a swig of rotgut whiskey with after a long day of chasing fool's gold or getting chased by even bigger fools who’d already found the real stuff. 

Thing about pards, though, they came in all shapes and sizes, just like the nuggets you hoped to find in that gulch. Some were honest as the day is long, though the days out here could be suspiciously short come winter. Others, well, they’d skin you quicker than a prairie dog could dive into its hole, given half a chance. You had to keep your wits about you, that's for sure. Couldn't just go trusting every fella who slapped you on the back and offered you a share of his claim – especially if he kept glancing nervous-like at the six-shooter strapped to his hip.

I recollect ol' Jebediah, used to call himself a "pard" of mine. Looked like a badger that had lost a fight with a tumbleweed. Jebediah swore he knew the location of the Mother Lode itself, hidden somewhere in the desolate wastes beyond Virginia City. Promised me riches beyond imagination if I'd just grubstake him. Well, I grubstaked him alright, bought him enough beans and bacon to choke a horse. He disappeared into the desert like a raindrop in the sun, and I never saw hide nor hair of him again. The only thing I got out of that "pardnership" was a persistent craving for bacon and a healthy dose of skepticism. So, "pard," you see, was a word that could mean a whole heap of things, from a handshake and shared dream to a good ol' fashioned rip-off. Out here, you learned to read the man, not just the word.
