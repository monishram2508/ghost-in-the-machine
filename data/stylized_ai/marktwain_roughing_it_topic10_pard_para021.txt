Well, pard, let me tell you about this Pard fellow I met out in the Nevada Territory, a specimen peculiar enough to make even a buzzard squint. He weren't no ordinary coyote, neither, mind you. Pard, as he insisted on being called, claimed to be a prospector, though the only prospectin' he ever seemed to do involved squinting at the horizon and philosophizin' about the nature of gold and the folly of honest labor. He was built like a scarecrow after a dust storm – all elbows and knees, with a beard that looked like it’d been woven by tumbleweeds and a smile that could curdle milk at fifty paces. He carried this contraption, see, he called a "divining rod," though it mostly divined dust and the occasional sidewinder. Said it was a secret ancient instrument, handed down from pharaohs or Druids or maybe just a particularly ambitious gopher, I never could rightly tell.

Now, Pard swore he was just one lucky strike away from payin' off the national debt with his own personal gold mine. He'd spin these yarns 'round the campfire – epic sagas of lost treasures, guarded by rattlesnakes the size of small oxen and spirits lookin' to lead you astray. He'd go on for hours, fuelled by cheap whiskey and the burning conviction that he was about to be richer than Croesus. You'd almost start believin' him, too, until you saw him try to pan for gold using his hat as a sieve. The results were less than impressive.

He never struck it rich, far as I know, just kept on plodding along, divining rod twitching and eyes gleaming with that crazy gleam. I reckon he was happier chasin' the dream than he ever would have been catchin' it. And you know what, pard? Maybe that’s the real gold in this life – that foolish, eternal hope that keeps a man stumblin' forward, even when his boots are full of sand and his pockets are empty. Or maybe he was just plum loco. Hard to say, out there in the Territory. Hard to say.
