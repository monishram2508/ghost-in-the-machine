Naples, ah, Naples! A city that makes a pigsty look organized. I’ve seen sunsets prettier on a dustbin lid, and smelled fragrances more alluring emanating from a stable. But confound it all, there's a charm to the place, a devil-may-care swagger that grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go. It's a city built on layers, mind you. Layers of history, of course, but also layers of refuse, of scams, and of enough shouting to wake the dead – and probably does, considering the number of catacombs lurking beneath your feet. The streets are a frightful tangle, no wider than a donkey’s backside, and crammed tighter than a politician's promises. You’ll dodge Vespas driven by lunatics who treat traffic laws as mere suggestions, and peddlers hawking wares that range from suspiciously cheap silk scarves to icons that have clearly seen better centuries.

And the people! Lord love 'em, they are a spectacle in themselves. Animated as a marionette show, they gesticulate with a fervor that could launch a thousand ships, arguing over the price of tomatoes like their lives depend on it. You might find yourself, as I did, being pulled into a philosophical debate about the best way to cook pasta, even if you can barely tell spaghetti from fettuccine. The Neapolitans, you see, have an opinion on everything, and they’re not shy about sharing it, often at the top of their lungs. But beneath the bluster and the chaos, there's a heart of gold, or at least a heart plated in gold. A generosity of spirit that appears at the most unexpected moments, like a sudden burst of sunshine on a cloudy day. They'll share their meager meal, their outlandish stories, and their unfiltered opinions with a stranger, simply because, well, because that's just what they do. So, Naples. It’s a maddening, beguiling, thoroughly exasperating city, and if you’re not careful, it'll steal a piece of your heart while you’re busy trying to keep your wallet from being stolen. I'd wager you wouldn't have it any other way.
