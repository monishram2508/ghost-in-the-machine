Mormonism, formally known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a distinct Christian religion that originated in the United States during the early 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith, who claimed to have received divine revelations, the faith centers around the Book of Mormon, a scripture that Mormons believe to be a companion volume to the Bible, containing accounts of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. This scripture, along with the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, forms the basis of their theological framework. A key tenet of Mormon belief is the concept of continuing revelation, meaning that God continues to communicate with humanity through prophets, similar to the biblical prophets. This belief sets them apart from many traditional Christian denominations who believe that revelation ceased with the death of the apostles.

Mormon theology also incorporates unique views on the nature of God, humanity's pre-mortal existence, and the potential for exaltation to become like God. They believe in the importance of family and hold the family unit as central to both earthly life and eternal progression. Temple worship is a significant part of Mormon practice, where sacred ordinances, including baptisms for the dead and eternal marriage sealings, are performed. These ordinances are believed to extend blessings and opportunities for salvation to both the living and the deceased. The Church emphasizes strong moral values, including honesty, integrity, and service to others. Members are encouraged to abstain from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, adhering to a health code known as the Word of Wisdom. Missionary work plays a prominent role in spreading the faith, with young adults often dedicating two years of their lives to serving as missionaries, sharing their beliefs and serving communities around the world. The Mormon Church has a hierarchical structure, led by a president and a quorum of apostles, who oversee the global operations and spiritual direction of the Church. Over time, the Church has grown significantly, establishing a presence in numerous countries and becoming a prominent force in both religious and social spheres.
