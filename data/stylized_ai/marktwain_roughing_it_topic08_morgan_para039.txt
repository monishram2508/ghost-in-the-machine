Morgan, now there was a specimen. A fellow you could spot a mile off, even if you were squinting through a Nevada dust storm, which, incidentally, is a feat best left to coyotes and desert rats with a particular fondness for grit. He hailed from – well, nobody quite knew where, and Morgan wasn’t volunteering the information. Suspected he’d outrun a posse or two, or perhaps a particularly persistent bill collector. He possessed a face like a topographical map of the Sierra Nevada, all rugged peaks and deep, shady canyons, carved, no doubt, by years of hard living and questionable decisions. His hands, though, were something else. Huge they were, like hams dangling off his wrists, and calloused something fierce. Said he used to be a blacksmith, though I reckon he could’ve single-handedly dismantled a locomotive with those mitts if he took a mind to. 

He weren't much for conversation, mind you. Grunted more than he spoke, and what words did escape his lips usually concerned the price of whiskey or the sorry state of the Denver & Rio Grande. But he had a dry wit about him, like a desert spring that trickles just enough to keep you from dying of thirst, but not enough to wash your face. Once, I saw him watching a dog trying to bury a bone in the rocky ground outside the saloon. The poor critter kept digging and scratching, only to unearth another rock. Morgan watched for a good five minutes, then let out a low chuckle and said, "That dog's got more determination than sense. Reminds me of half the fellas I know prospectin' for gold." Now, that was a profound observation, ain't it? You could write a whole book on that one sentence, and likely sell it for a fortune back east where folks get paid to ponder such weighty matters. Morgan, though, he just spat a stream of tobacco juice and went back to staring into his whiskey, likely contemplating the profound idiocy of humanity, one bone-burying dog at a time. A curious fella, that Morgan.
