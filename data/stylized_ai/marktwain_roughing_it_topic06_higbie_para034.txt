Higbie, you ask? Well, now there's a specimen for you, ripe for pickling in the brine of human eccentricity. Higbie was a man who could make a mule look graceful, and a fortune in the Comstock would simply turn to dust in his grasp, though I reckon the man never saw one. He came west, not for silver veins, you see, but for, he claimed, a 'change of scenery' and 'spiritual renewal.' Though a man who calls sleeping off a bender in a livery stable 'spiritual renewal' is in need of more than a new landscape, I wager. He had the look of a plucked chicken about him, all skin and bone and nervous twitches. His mustache, a pathetic wisp of ginger struggling for survival, looked like it had lost a fight with a particularly persistent caterpillar.

He arrived in Virginia City, of all places, with nothing but a carpetbag full of dented tin cups and a Bible he claimed he'd read cover to cover, though his interpretations were as wild as a jackrabbit on a moonless night. Higbie had a way of speaking that resembled a confused auctioneer, bidding on phantom lots. He'd start a sentence on Tuesdays and only finish it come Thursday, leaving you to guess what in tarnation he was going on about in the meantime. He tried his hand at mining, of course, like every other poor fool who thought a pickaxe was a magic wand, but his claim yielded more rattlesnakes than ore. Then he tried selling patent medicine, guaranteeing eternal youth to folks who looked older than Methuselah, but his concoctions seemed to have the unintended effect of making hair fall out. The last I saw of Higbie, he was headed east, claiming he'd found the 'true vein' in a different kind of soil and promising to return with a machine that could turn tumbleweeds into gold bricks. Lord help the poor souls that crossed his path then; a fella could believe just about anything in those days.
