Now, about this chamois creature, bless its woolly little heart. Seems to me, the Creator was having a bit of a lark the day He conjured up this mountain goat relative. A dash of goat, a sprinkle of antelope, and maybe a pinch of deer for good measure – and there you have it, a chamois! Folks call 'em graceful, bounding across crags and precipices like they're strolling on a Sunday promenade. Me, I suspect they've just got a healthy fear of falling. Gravity, you know, has a way of keeping one’s movements… deliberate. I reckon if you gave 'em a comfortable sofa and a decent cup of tea, they'd stay put like the rest of us.

These critters, they live up high, where the air's thin and the company's even thinner. Must be lonely work, perpetually perched on a precarious ledge, contemplating the existential dread of a misplaced hoof. And their horns, oh, those horns! Like dainty little question marks perpetually etched into the sky. Are they questioning the wisdom of their lifestyle? Are they pondering the meaning of marmots? Or are they simply wondering where they left their spectacles? It’s a conundrum, I tell you! 

They are hunted, of course. Man, in his infinite wisdom, deems it necessary to chase after these creatures with a rifle and a thirst for… well, for whatever it is that possessing a chamois hide fulfills. Perhaps it's a symbolic conquest of the mountains themselves, a chance to shout, "I climbed it, I shot it, I tanned it!" I have no desire to participate, for me the chamois's true beauty comes from watching its curious prancing in the distance, a spectacle far more satisfying than any rug, no matter how supple. Besides, I’m fairly certain a well-fed housecat provides just as much warmth and considerably less existential angst.
