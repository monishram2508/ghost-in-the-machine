Slade, now there was a fella who could curdle your blood faster than a jug of sour milk left out in the sun. A stage station keeper, you understand, a sort of landlord out in the God-forsaken wilderness where the only entertainment was watching tumbleweeds engage in a high-stakes chase. He kept the stage station at Cold Springs, Nevada, and while the name suggested refreshment, you were more likely to find cold steel staring you down than cold water quenching your thirst. They say he was a pistol-shot to reckon with, but I reckon a venomous rattlesnake ain't too shabby in a gunfight neither. Same principle: both ain't got no moral compass.

I saw him myself, a bulky hombre with eyes that could bore through a granite mountain. He looked like he’d been carved from a particularly unforgiving piece of desert scenery, all hard angles and sun-baked leather. Story goes he'd once shot a man for not addressing him as "Mr. Slade." Or maybe it was for whistling off-key. Accounts varied, you see, but the common thread was usually a corpse and Slade standing nearby, looking like he was trying to remember where he parked his horse. 

Folks whispered tales about him; how he’d once killed a bear with his bare hands (then forced it to cook him breakfast), how he'd won a fortune at cards by reading minds (or more likely, by having the largest pistol in the territory). Probably more hot air than truth, but in that desolate land, a good story was worth more than gold dust. And Slade, bless his devilish heart, was a walking, talking, shooting-iron-wearing story. You could feel the fear roll off the place like a palpable fog. He owned that station, and maybe, just maybe, a good portion of the surrounding souls as well. Made me mighty glad to be riding through, not planning on settling down. Some landscapes are best admired from a distance, and Slade, by thunder, was one of them.
