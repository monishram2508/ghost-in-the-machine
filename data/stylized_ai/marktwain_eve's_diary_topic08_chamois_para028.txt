Now, about this Chamois creature, I must confess, I observed one such specimen – or rather, a picture of one, for the Alps being a touch out of my usual strollin’ grounds – and found it to be a right queer affair. Looks a bit like a goat who’s gone and gotten himself all fancied up for a ball, horns curved back like a disgruntled gentleman’s mustache, and a coat of fur that seems tailored for maximum stealth amongst the crags. They say these beasts live up high, where the air is thin enough to sober up a bishop and the scenery breathtaking enough to make a poet forget his rhyming. Apparently, they prance about on these precipices with an agility that would shame a hummingbird, leaping from rock to rock like so many woolly sprites. 

It strikes me as a rather inconvenient lifestyle, this clambering about on cliffs for a living. I imagine mealtime consists of cautiously nibbling on whatever scrubby plant life has dared to grow at such precarious altitudes, all while trying not to become a sudden snack for a passing eagle. And courting! Goodness gracious, imagine trying to woo a fair chamois lass with the wind howling and the potential for a fatal tumble ever present. One can only assume that courtship rituals amongst chamois involve a great deal of synchronized leaping and head-butting, a truly romantic ballet performed on nature’s most unforgiving stage. But perhaps that's what makes them such sought-after quarry for hunters, these agile mountain goats. It’s the challenge, you see. A man’s gotta prove he’s cleverer than a creature that spends its days defying gravity and dodging avalanches. Or, perhaps, it’s simply that they’re mighty tasty roasted over a campfire, I wouldn’t know, having yet to taste this so-called "game" and would frankly be too worried that, between bites, it would hop right out of my stomach!
