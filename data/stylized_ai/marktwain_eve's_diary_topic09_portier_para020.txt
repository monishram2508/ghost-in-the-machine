Now, a portier, that's a thing you don't see every day, unless you happen to be frequenting them grand establishments what think a bit of cloth can hold back the very breeze itself. I encountered one such creature—the portier, mind you, not the establishment—while visiting a fellow named Peabody, whose parlor was draped more richly than a sultan’s camel. This portier, it weren't no ordinary curtain, oh no. It was a tapestry woven with more grapes and cherubs than Noah's Ark had animals. Peabody, he claimed it kept out the drafts, as if a draft would dare intrude upon such a display of opulence. But I suspected it were more about showing off, much like a peacock fanning its feathers at a hen that's seen it all before.

The thing was heavy, near on tore Peabody's gilded rod from the wall every time he swept it aside to offer me a ginger ale, which I suspect he only had on hand to further impress. I couldn't help but think of all the other things that cloth could be doing, like providing warm blankets for orphans or patching the leaky roof of the poor widow down the street. But no, here it hung, a silent sentinel against the elements, guarding a room already as warm as a summer's day and containing nothing more valuable than Peabody's collection of porcelain thimbles, each more ridiculous than the last. I reckon if a burglar were to break into that house, he'd be more likely to be suffocated by the sheer abundance of velvet and lace than apprehended by the law. That portier, it stood as a testament to the peculiar human habit of accumulating things we don't need, simply because we can. A grand, useless, and undeniably humorous commentary on the vanity of man, hung right there on Peabody's wall.
