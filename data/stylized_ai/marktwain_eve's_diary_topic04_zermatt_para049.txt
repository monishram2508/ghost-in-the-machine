Zermatt, you see, is a place that clings to the side of the Matterhorn like a lovesick leech to a barmaid’s affections. And bless my soul, but it’s a sight to behold, that Matterhorn, all pointy and proud, like a bishop’s mitre after a particularly good sermon. The village itself, though, is a curious affair. They say it’s car-free, which is a fine thing, I suppose, unless you happen to enjoy the satisfying rumble of an internal combustion engine, or the particular delight of scattering pigeons with a well-timed backfire. Instead, you have these electric carts, putt-putting about like oversized, geriatric golf carts, driven by fellows who look as though they’ve spent their entire lives ferrying luggage and the occasional excessively-goggled tourist.

The air, of course, is bracing – so bracing, in fact, that it could curdle milk at fifty paces. The higher you climb, the thinner it gets, until you find yourself gasping like a stranded trout at a temperance rally. And the altitude, well, it plays tricks on the mind, I tell you. One minute you’re admiring the view, the next you’re convinced that the yodeling coming from down the valley is actually a coded message from the Swiss Confederation. The shops, naturally, are filled with the usual tourist trinkets - cowbells that clang with the fervor of a lovesick blacksmith, pocket knives with more implements than a Swiss Army surgeon, and chocolate that costs more than a small mule. But the real amusement, you see, comes from observing the other tourists. There’s the gentleman in full climbing gear, who clearly hasn’t seen a mountain since his youth, puffing and panting like a steam engine about to explode. And the ladies, decked out in their finest furs, tottering about on heels entirely unsuitable for cobbled streets, looking for all the world like penguins trying to navigate a particularly uneven ballroom floor. Zermatt, you see, is a spectacle, a comedy, a grand, overpriced, and thoroughly delightful farce played out against the backdrop of a truly magnificent mountain.
