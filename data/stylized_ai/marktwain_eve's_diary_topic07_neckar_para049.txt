The Neckar, now there’s a river to give a body pause, ain't it? Not as puffed up and self-important as that Rhine, all full of castles and legends and tourists thick as flies on molasses. No, the Neckar, she’s more like a shy country girl, content to meander through valleys and vineyards, not making a whole lot of fuss about herself. She ain’t trying to be dramatic, she just *is*. And bless her heart, she's got a certain quiet charm about her, a kind of unassuming grace. You see, I once watched a goose, a particularly plump and opinionated specimen of the feathered persuasion, try to navigate the Neckar near Heidelberg. Now, that goose, he thought he was something special, squawking and paddling like he owned the whole river. But the Neckar, she just kept on flowing, unimpressed by his bluster. He ended up getting tangled in some reeds, looking for all the world like a feathered prune, his dignity completely deflated. That’s the Neckar for you – subtle, but she’ll put you in your place if you get too big for your britches. And speaking of britches, I reckon she's seen a few changes in her day, what with the Romans mucking about and building bridges, and then those university students scribbling poetry about her banks. Oh, she’s a witness to history, that Neckar, but she ain’t one to gossip. She just keeps on flowing, year after year, carrying along the reflections of castles and the dreams of young lovers, all the while humming a quiet tune only the willow trees seem to understand. And you know, sometimes, when the sun is just right and the water is sparkling, you can almost hear her chuckle to herself, a low, secret laugh at all the foolishness she's seen. And you can’t help but smile along with her, because that’s the thing about the Neckar – she’s got a way of making you feel like you’re in on the joke.
