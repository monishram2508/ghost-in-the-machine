Genoa, ah, a city that clings to the Ligurian coast like a barnacle to a forgotten galleon! One approaches it, preferably by steamer, lest the coach road send one tumbling down a ravine or two, and discovers a place that's a veritable warren of streets, so narrow and winding a self-respecting dog would get lost in five minutes flat. Why, a body could swear the architects laid them out after a particularly potent dose of that local pesto they seem so fond of. And the buildings! They stand shoulder to shoulder, painted in every hue imaginable, from faded rose to a sickly chartreuse that would make a chameleon blush. One wonders if they hold each other up out of neighbourly obligation, or if they are simply too stubborn to fall down.

The Genoese, now there’s a study for the naturalist! A hardy bunch, they are, weathered and shrewd, with eyes that could spot a counterfeit lira at fifty paces. They bustle about with a purpose that suggests either a pressing appointment with a merchant prince or a desperate need to escape the scrutiny of a particularly persistent tax collector. They speak a dialect that sounds, to the untutored ear, like a particularly agitated cat arguing with a rusty hinge, but beneath the harsh syllables lies a spirit of independence and a deep-seated pride in their maritime heritage.

One wanders through the Caruggi, those infamous alleyways, at one's own peril, dodging scooters driven by youths seemingly possessed by demons and narrowly escaping the occasional deluge of water flung from a window by some irate housewife. One might find, tucked away in a shadowed corner, a tiny trattoria serving up a plate of trenette al pesto that could convert a vegetarian to pasta worship in a single bite. And, if one has the good fortune to stumble upon the Piazza De Ferrari, one might be struck dumb by the sheer audacity of the fountain, a monument to civic pride that seems to say, "Yes, we are Genoese, and we have water, so what?" All in all, Genoa is a city of contrasts, a place where beauty and chaos intertwine, and where one can find both delight and bewilderment in equal measure. A most singular and unforgettable place, I assure you.
