Chamonix, bless its heart, is what one might call a town attempting desperately to be something it isn't, rather like a parvenu lady dripping in borrowed diamonds and affecting a Parisian accent after a fortnight spent reading novels in the Bois de Boulogne. The mountains, mind you, are genuine enough – great, hulking brutes of rock and ice, the sort that would make even Moses think twice about scaling them. Mont Blanc, particularly, looms over the place like a disapproving aunt, forever reminding everyone that they are, at best, insignificant gnats buzzing around her skirts.

The village itself? Well, it's chock-full of shops selling items of such utter superfluity that one suspects their sole purpose is to lighten the wallets of tourists more easily parted with their francs than their common sense. One can purchase, for instance, a miniature ice axe encrusted with what I suspect are simply highly polished pebbles, for a price that would feed a family of four for a month in Geneva. Then there are the restaurants, each vying to outdo the other in terms of exorbitant prices and incomprehensible menus, where the waiter looks upon you with an air of barely concealed pity should you dare to order something as plebian as, say, a simple steak.

And the people! Ah, the people of Chamonix! A curious mix of hardened mountaineers, tanned to the texture of old leather and possessing a taciturnity that could curdle milk, and pasty-faced city dwellers attempting to look equally rugged, though failing miserably, often sporting brand new climbing gear that's never seen so much as a pebble outside the shop. They strut about with an air of bravado, these urban climbers, regaling anyone who will listen with tales of their simulated daring, their heroic struggles against… well, against the moderately steep slope behind the village, mostly. One can almost see the mountain, old Mont Blanc herself, chuckling to herself in amusement at their antics. Yes, Chamonix is a curious place, indeed. A place where nature shows her splendor with a wink and a smile, while the human inhabitants, well, they simply try to make a living off of it, bless their hearts. And charge you handsomely for the privilege.
