Now, about these mosques, these towering structures that dot the landscapes of, well, just about everywhere but my backyard, wouldn't you know it. A body'd think, judging by the hullabaloo kicked up by some folks, that they were fixing to sprout up overnight and turn the whole blessed country into some kind of... well, some kind of miniature Constantinople. But hold your horses, friend, because what I've seen is more like a particularly ambitious pigeon coop gone wild. 

They do cut a rather impressive figure, I'll grant you that. All those domes and minarets reaching for the sky, like they're trying to out-argue the clouds. Reminds me of a fellow I once knew who built a chicken coop so fancy, the chickens refused to roost in it, claiming it was too drafty and pretentious. These mosques, though, they seem to have a steady stream of folks bustling in and out, bowing and scraping and muttering things that I, being a heathen of the first water, couldn't make heads or tails of. Seemingly, these folks are dead serious about their devotions.

Now, some say these buildings are hotbeds of sedition, plotting the overthrow of the American way of life and whatnot. But, speaking as a man who's seen more conspiracies hatched over a game of poker than in any religious institution, I reckon that's mostly hogwash. Sure, there might be a few bad apples in the bunch, just like there are in Congress, or the Elks Club for that matter, but to paint the whole lot with the same brush is about as fair as claiming all cats are lazy just because Garfield exists. Besides, from what I can gather, they mostly spend their time praying and reading and trying to be better people, which, if you ask me, is a darn sight more productive than half the things I see happening in this town on a Saturday night. So, let them have their fancy buildings and their mumbled prayers, I say. It ain't hurting anybody, and who knows, maybe a little more piety wouldn't do this country any harm, after all.
