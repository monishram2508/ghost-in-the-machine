Well, I reckon I've seen a thing or two in my time, but this glacier business takes the cake, don’t you know? It’s a mountain o' ice, slow as molasses in January, but don’t let that fool you into thinkin' it ain’t got a mind of its own. Why, it’s just creepin’ and crawlin’ down the valley, grumbling like a dyspeptic old man after a bad oyster. They say it's carving out these valleys, but seems to me it's doin' it more out of spite than any real industriousness. I swear, it looked like I've caught it glancing sideways at the poor little trees, like it's sizing them up for a chew.

Now, some folks get all excited about the science of it – "erosion," they call it, and "glacial till" this and that. Sounds like a fancy remedy for a sore throat, if you ask me. But I reckon the main thing to understand about a glacier is that it's a powerful, ponderous brute, and it does what it pleases, when it pleases. And what it pleases most is to rearrange the landscape without so much as a "by your leave." You could build a whole town in its path and it wouldn't give it a second thought, just plow right through, leaving a pile of splinters and a new lake where Main Street used to be.

And the colour! It’s like staring into a cat’s eye, only the cat's the size of Rhode Island. The light just seems to dance inside, and the blue? Well, I never saw a blue that deep or that cold outside of a politician's heart. And here's the catch of the whole thing: people will come from all over the globe to see it, to gawk at it, to wonder at it, like it’s something magical when it's really just a big frozen river that's bound to melt one of these days. Reminds me a bit of men paying fortunes to see a woman who will wrinkle in time. But I guess there's something impressive about that brute force that the good Lord let loose on the world. Makes a body feel mighty small, right down to his socks.
