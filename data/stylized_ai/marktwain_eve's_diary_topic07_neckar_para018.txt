The Neckar, now there's a river for you, a proper German sort of river, all business and castles and a peculiar shade of green that I swear you couldn't find replicated in any artist's palette. I wouldn’t call it beautiful, mind you. Beautiful is for the ladies and maybe the Arno if it's been particularly well-behaved, but the Neckar is more…picturesque. Like a well-worn boot, it’s seen some things. One can practically hear the echoes of Roman legions marching along its banks, or the clang of hammers building those impossibly perched castles that seem to sprout directly from the rock, daring gravity to do its worst.

I reckon old Father Neckar has witnessed enough feuding and beer-drinking to write a history book twice the size of Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” – and twice as entertaining, I suspect. Heidelberg sits there, all university and romantic ruins, looking down on the river with an air of learned indifference, as if to say, "Oh, that old thing? We've had it since Charlemagne, don't you know?" And down yonder it winds through Tübingen, where the students are always punting about and looking dreadfully serious, probably debating the finer points of existentialism whilst nearly capsizing into the murky depths.

One could almost imagine the river chuckling to itself as it carries along all the modern contraptions - tour boats crammed full of camera-wielding tourists, barges laden with who-knows-what, and the occasional solitary kayak wobbling uncertainly against the current. Seems a bit incongruous, doesn’t it? All this modern bustle overlaid on such an ancient landscape. But there it is, a testament to the fact that even the most stubborn of rivers can't resist the relentless march of progress, though I'd wager it secretly prefers the days when the only thing disturbing its waters was the reflection of a knight in shining armour, or maybe a particularly large, inebriated fish. And of course, the echoes of Eve’s laughter in the distance.
