It seems to me that the Chamois, bless its woolly little heart, is a creature that occupies a most peculiar position in the grand menagerie of life. One might say it’s akin to finding a particularly stubborn button on a coat, always threatening to pop off and vanish into the ether. I first encountered the chamois—or rather, I attempted to—whilst traversing the Alps with my dear, if somewhat dramatically inclined, companion. We were assured that the view from the pinnacle was akin to gazing upon the face of paradise, a prospect which, naturally, she couldn’t resist. I, being of a more pragmatic nature, was more concerned with not tumbling down a ravine.

Anyways, there it was, perched on a ledge that looked about as stable as a politician’s promise. A chamois, mind you, not paradise. It regarded us with an air of utter disdain, its little beard twitching as if it found our mere existence an affront to its delicate sensibilities. It hopped and skipped with a nonchalant grace that suggested it'd been practicing ballet since birth on a stage made of ice and loose gravel. We, on the other hand, scrambled and wheezed, leaving a trail of dropped handkerchiefs and muttered curses in our wake. Its eyes held a spark of amusement, a look that said plainly, “You silly humans and your ridiculous ambitions!” I considered firing my pistol to scare the creature, but my darling friend insisted on preserving what she called the 'Serenity of nature'. I suspected she just wanted a portrait of it for her mantelpiece. As it was, the chamois simply leaped across another chasm and disappeared into the mist, leaving us to ponder the wisdom of chasing after creatures who were clearly better equipped for the task than ourselves. All I can say is, next time paradise calls, I'm bringing my own stepladder and a healthy dose of skepticism.
