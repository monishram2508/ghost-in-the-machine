Lucerne, also widely known as alfalfa, stands as a globally significant forage crop, celebrated for its exceptional nutritional value and versatility in agricultural systems. This perennial legume, scientifically named *Medicago sativa*, is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to access water and nutrients from considerable depths within the soil profile, making it remarkably drought-tolerant compared to many other forage species. This deep root system also plays a crucial role in soil health, improving structure, aeration, and water infiltration, contributing to the overall sustainability of agricultural practices. Lucerne is highly valued for its high protein content, digestible fiber, and a rich array of vitamins and minerals, making it an ideal feed source for livestock, particularly dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, and horses. It can be grazed directly in pastures, harvested as hay, ensiled for silage, or dehydrated into lucerne meal, offering farmers a range of options to cater to their specific livestock management needs and climatic conditions.

The nitrogen-fixing capabilities of lucerne are another key aspect of its ecological and agricultural importance. Through a symbiotic relationship with *Rhizobium* bacteria in its root nodules, lucerne converts atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by plants, enriching the soil and reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. This natural fertilization process not only lowers input costs for farmers but also minimizes the environmental impacts associated with excessive fertilizer use, such as greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution. Lucerne's adaptability extends to various climates, although it thrives best in well-drained soils with a neutral pH and ample sunlight. However, breeders have developed cultivars adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including colder regions and areas with slightly acidic soils. Cultivation practices typically involve careful seedbed preparation, inoculation with *Rhizobium* bacteria to enhance nitrogen fixation, and regular cutting to promote regrowth and maintain forage quality. Efficient weed control is crucial during establishment, and proper fertilization, particularly with phosphorus and potassium, is essential for optimal growth and yield. Lucerne's persistence, nutritional density, and soil-enhancing properties collectively contribute to its enduring popularity as a cornerstone of sustainable livestock production systems worldwide.
