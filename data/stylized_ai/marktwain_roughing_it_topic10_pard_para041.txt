Now, pard, let me tell you about the peculiar animal that calls itself a "pard." Some fellers call 'em leopards, others panthers, but out here in the territory, a pard's a pard and that's good enough for government work, as the sayin' goes. They're catamounts of a spotted persuasion, see, fancy patterned hides that’d fetch a pretty penny back East if you could wrestle one off 'em without gettin' your innards rearranged. I ain't never been much for fancy clothes, but I reckon a pard's got a natural elegance, the sort that makes a fella feel like he's accidentally walked into a high-falutin' ballroom in his dust-covered boots.

They're built low to the ground, like a politician avoidin' scrutiny, and they glide through the underbrush quieter than a church mouse robbin' the collection plate. And quick? Lord have mercy, they can cover ground faster than a rumor spreadin' through a gold camp. I once saw one go from sleepin' in a tree, lookin' as lazy as a hound dog on a Sunday afternoon, to chasin' a jackrabbit across the flats in the blink of an eye. The rabbit, poor thing, hadn't a prayer. 

These ain’t your domesticated house cats, mind you. A pard’s got a temper sharper than a newly honed bowie knife, and they ain't afraid to use it. They’ve got teeth like little daggers and claws that could etch your tombstone before you even knew you were headin' that way. Respect a pard, is what I'm sayin', and keep a healthy distance. I knew a feller once, name of Jed, who thought he could pet one. Said it looked “kinda cute.” Jed ain't around to admire no more cuteness. He learned that a pard's "cute" is about as harmless as a rattlesnake convention. They're solitary creatures, mostly, preferrin' their own company to the blatherin' of humans, and I can't say I blame 'em. Seems like a sensible choice, given the options. A man can learn a thing or two from a pard, if he’s got the sense to keep his mouth shut and his eyes peeled.
