Now, about this business of portieres, or, as some fancy-pants folk call 'em, "door curtains." Seems like a right silly notion, at first blush, hanging a whole swath of cloth where a perfectly good door used to be. Reminds one a mite of Adam's fig leaf – only grander, and less about shame, more about keeping out drafts and showing off. Why, I recall seeing one in Mrs. Vandergelt’s parlor – a veritable tapestry woven of peacock feathers and what I suspect were the teeth of endangered beasties. It was so heavy it near pulled the doorframe off its hinges, and gave a body the distinct impression they were entering a sultan’s tent, not a respectable widow’s abode. She claimed it kept out the winter chill, but I suspected it was mostly to keep out the less desirable sort of callers, like yours truly.

Then there's the practicality of the thing. Imagine, if you will, attempting to make a hasty exit during a parlor game gone wrong (say, a particularly cutting round of charades involving bicarbonate of soda and a surprised cat), and finding yourself tangled in a veritable jungle of embroidered roses and velvet fringe. You’d be a sitting duck, I tell you! Bound to be caught, and sentenced to another cup of Mrs. Higgins' atrocious tea.

Still, I grant you, they do lend a certain air of… theatricality to a room. Like stepping into a stage play where the drama is mostly about choosing the right sherry and avoiding Aunt Mildred's pronouncements on spiritualism. And, I daresay, they’re quite useful for concealing a multitude of sins. A poorly patched wall, a collection of taxidermied squirrels that might embarrass the average visitor, or perhaps a secret passageway leading to the liquor cabinet – all conveniently hidden behind a strategically placed portiere. So, while I remain skeptical of their ostentatious nature, I confess there's a certain charm to these dangly draperies. Just try to remember which side you entered from, or you might find yourself wandering around in circles, muttering about lost souls and peacock feathers until the rooster crows.
