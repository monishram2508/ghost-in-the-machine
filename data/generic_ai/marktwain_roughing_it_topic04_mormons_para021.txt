The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, is a restorationist Christian denomination that originated in the United States during the 19th century. Founded by Joseph Smith Jr., the church's foundational scripture is the Book of Mormon, which Smith claimed to have translated from golden plates revealed to him by an angel named Moroni. This text, alongside the Bible, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, form the scriptural canon for Latter-day Saints. The Book of Mormon narrates the story of ancient inhabitants of the Americas who were visited by Jesus Christ after his resurrection, offering an account of salvation history distinct from traditional Christian theology.

Central to Mormon belief is the concept of a "restoration" of the original church established by Jesus Christ. Latter-day Saints believe that after the death of the apostles, the true gospel was lost due to apostasy, and that Smith was chosen to restore the fullness of the gospel to the earth. This restoration includes the reestablishment of priesthood authority, the power to act in God’s name, through a lineage traced back to the apostles Peter, James, and John. The church emphasizes the importance of personal revelation, encouraging members to seek direct guidance from God through prayer and scripture study.

Family is also a cornerstone of Mormon life, with a strong emphasis on eternal families and temple ordinances. Latter-day Saints believe that families can be sealed together for eternity through temple marriage, a sacred ceremony performed in dedicated temples throughout the world. These temples are considered houses of the Lord, where members perform sacred ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, allowing deceased ancestors the opportunity to accept the gospel. Missionary service is another significant aspect of Mormon culture, with young men and women often serving voluntary two-year or eighteen-month missions, respectively, sharing their faith with others around the globe. The church maintains a lay clergy, with members volunteering their time and talents to lead and serve in local congregations, fostering a strong sense of community and shared responsibility.
