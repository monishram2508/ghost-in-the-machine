Zermatt, ah yes, that quaint little flyspeck clinging to the foot of the monstrous Matterhorn like a barnacle to a whale. They tell you it's charming, idyllic even, with its horse-drawn carriages clip-clopping along cobblestone streets and nary a motorcar to offend the delicate sensibilities of the alpine air. And I'll grant you, there's a certain picturesqueness to it, like a meticulously constructed cuckoo clock village sprung to life. But charming? Well, that depends on your definition of charm. I'd wager a good dollar that half the inhabitants are Swiss bankers disguised as rosy-cheeked shepherds, silently counting their fortune as they trudge past loaded with wood. And the other half? Likely descendants of William Tell, still nursing a grudge about that confounded apple.

The Matterhorn itself, of course, is the main attraction, a geological exclamation point rising above it all, forever judging the inadequacies of man. They say it’s majestic. I say it’s a colossal rock, forever covered in a dusting of snow, reminding me that I forgot to wear my galoshes. And the tourists! Heavens to Betsy, the tourists! They swarm the place like locusts, snapping photographs with the fervor of mad scientists documenting a new species of cheese. They come clad in their finest ski attire, which, mind you, seems to consist entirely of neon colors and enough zippers to launch a small dirigible. They stand about squinting up at the Matterhorn, mouths agape, occasionally uttering profound statements like "Wow, it's tall!" or "Do you think it's real?" One almost expects them to attempt to climb it in their brightly colored ski boots, armed with nothing but a selfie stick and a thirst for adventure. And then, of course, there are the shops, brimming with cuckoo clocks, cowbells, and enough chocolate to induce a diabetic coma in a herd of yaks. One can’t help but wonder if the whole town is secretly a factory designed solely to produce overpriced souvenirs for gullible foreigners. But still, one must admit, even a cynic like myself can find a sliver of beauty in it all. If only they'd install a proper saloon and a far more comfortable chair to observe the whole shebang from.
