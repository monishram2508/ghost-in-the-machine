Baden, ah, Baden! A place so exquisitely boring it could make a bishop contemplate arson. A gilded cage, some call it, where the elite of Europe come to preen and parade, much like peacocks who’ve swallowed a dictionary. They flock here, these lords and ladies, countesses and coronets, drawn by the mystical healing properties of the waters, which, if you ask me, smell suspiciously like boiled cabbage and diluted despair. One can hardly stroll along the Lichtentaler Allee without tripping over a baroness lamenting her dwindling fortune or a duke bemoaning the inadequacies of his chef. And the gambling! Don't even get me started. The Casino is a veritable den of iniquity, disguised as a rococo palace, where fortunes are made and lost with the casual flick of a wrist. I've seen more tears shed there in an evening than in a year's worth of sentimental novels.

The conversation, mind you, is hardly more stimulating. The topics revolve almost exclusively around lineage, land holdings, and the unbearable tedium of being rich. One poor fellow, a newly elevated marquis, regaled me for a solid hour on the intricacies of his ancestral coat-of-arms, which, from what I gathered, consisted mainly of a particularly grumpy looking badger. It was about as fascinating as watching paint dry, only with significantly more pretensions. And the dinners! Course after course of elaborately prepared dishes, each one seemingly designed to impress rather than nourish. I swear, I once saw a pheasant stuffed inside a duck, which was then nestled inside a goose, all swimming in a sauce so rich it could fund a small war. By the end of the meal, one feels less like a nourished human and more like a foie gras goose, ready for a forced vacation to the digestive system. So, yes, Baden is a beautiful place, draped in luxury and teeming with nobility. Just don't expect to find your soul there, unless your soul happens to be exceptionally fond of boredom and badger heraldry.
