Zermatt, you say? Why, it's a village clinging to the hem of the Matterhorn like a lovesick swain to a particularly stony-faced lass. A place of such preposterous prettiness, it's almost indecent. You expect any moment for Dame Nature to blush and pull a cloud down as a veil. The air up there, thinner than a politician's promise, goes straight to your head, compelling you to acts of impulsive generosity, like buying a round of Glühwein for the entire population of the Bahnhofstrasse, and then, regretting it heartily the next morning when your purse feels lighter than a Swiss watchmaker’s scruples. They say there are no automobiles allowed, which is a grand notion until you discover the hordes of electric carts whizzing about with a silent, sinister efficiency, like oversized beetles on a caffeine bender. These contraptions, driven by youths with expressions as blank as a fresh snowdrift, nearly mow you down every ten paces. One begins to suspect they’re part of a plot, hatched by disgruntled hotel proprietors, to thin out the tourist ranks.

And the Matterhorn itself! It looms, a gigantic, jagged molar extracted from the very jaw of the earth. People stare at it, mouths agape, as though waiting for it to perform some kind of parlor trick. Days I spent tracking the darn mountain, sketching from one of the many viewing points, I would be distracted every so often, by the hordes of brightly dressed tourists who come armed with selfie sticks longer than climbing ropes, attempting to capture not the mountain’s majesty, but their own grinning faces superimposed upon it. Vanity, it appears, can summit even the most imposing peaks, while I am left to ponder the mysteries of the universe or to simply find a new viewing point before it’s too late. The whole business, I assure you, is enough to drive a sane man to drink… another round of that Glühwein, perhaps? For what, I ask you, is the purpose of witnessing the sublime if one cannot dull the nagging awareness of one's own utter insignificance with a bit of fermented grape juice?
