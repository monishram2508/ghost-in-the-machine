Baden-Baden, they call it. A place where the wealthy congregate, like flies to a particularly ripe… well, never mind. I arrived with Eve, of course, a creature whose curiosity about the world and its trappings is matched only by her innocence regarding their true worth. One might think this a flaw, but bless her heart, it keeps life interesting. We observed the grand promenades, wide enough to accommodate a regiment of peacocks showing off, though mercifully, only the human variety paraded there. One fellow, puffing himself up like a poisoned toad, tried to impress Eve with tales of gambling fortunes won and lost. I confess, I chuckled, for Eve’s only experience with games of chance involves throwing pebbles at squirrels. She listened politely, though, her eyes wide with wonder, undoubtedly imagining the squirrels suddenly flush with pebbles, building miniature fortresses of ill-gotten gains. The air itself seemed perfumed with money and anxiety, a most peculiar combination. The ladies, God bless them, were adorned with more jewels than a Sultan’s treasure chest, yet their faces wore expressions that suggested they were awaiting a bill from the milliner for thrice the worth of those baubles. The waters, purported to have healing properties, smelled strongly of sulfur and disappointment, prompting Eve to ask if they also cured melancholy, judging by the long faces dipping into them. We partook, naturally, because one must sample all experiences, even those that resemble the contents of a dragon’s breath. I suspect a bit of bracing dishonesty would do more good than all the mineral water in Germany. Even the birds seemed to sing in a minor key, as if lamenting the futility of riches in the face of the inevitable. All in all, Baden-Baden is a diverting spectacle, a sort of elaborate play put on by fortune’s favorites, though I suspect the backstage workings are far less glamorous, and involve a great deal more perspiration and frantic wig adjustments.
