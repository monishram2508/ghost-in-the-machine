Slade, now there was a station fit to curdle milk at fifty paces. A lonesome, God-forsaken place clinging to the side of the mountain like a tick on a dog's ear. You wouldn't catch me living there if they offered it free, furnished with solid gold chamber pots. Why, the only thing thriving in Slade was the tumbleweeds and the general feeling of being utterly forgotten. They had a stage station, naturally, and a saloon, naturally; because what's a mining town without a place to drown your sorrows and pick a fight over a queen that's been dead nigh a century? The saloon was a long, low affair, smelling perpetually of stale beer and desperation, the kind of place where the piano player looked like he’d lost his soul at a poker game thirty years ago and was still paying off the debt, note by excruciating note. I recall once watching a fella try to order a glass of milk there. The barkeep looked at him like he'd just asked for a date with his mother. I thought the man would faint on the spot. He ended up taking a swig of whiskey, just to save face.

The inhabitants, well, they were a breed apart, hardened by the elements and suspicion. They looked at you like you owed them money, and probably, you did, if you lingered too long near their claim. I saw more grim faces in Slade than I’ve seen tombstones in a cemetery. A fellow could write a book about the different shades of distrust on display there. One old coot, had a beard long enough to trip over, warned me that the only things worth a damn in Slade were the views and the whiskey and the less you looked at the views or drank the whiskey, the longer you were likely to live. He probably had a point. I heard tell they'd had a preacher come through once, hoping to save some souls. He left the next day, claiming he’d had a revelation that the souls in Slade were already damned beyond redemption. And I, having spent a whole day there, couldn’t say I disagreed much with the fella.
