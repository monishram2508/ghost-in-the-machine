Heidelberg! A town draped in ivy like a lovesick swain, clinging to the ruined castle with an ardor that would make Romeo blush. One half expects to see a troop of operatic students, brandishing dueling scars and bellowing out questionable ballads, emerge from behind every wisteria-laden trellis. And indeed, one is rarely disappointed. The young men of this burg, they seem to take as much pride in the acreage of disfigurement upon their cheeks as they do in their studies – which, if the whispers I’ve overheard are to be believed, is not saying much. The castle itself, oh, it's a spectacle! A grand, glorious mess, like a drunken giant attempted to build a palace after a particularly potent vintage. One can wander through the broken halls, imagining the grand balls and revelries of yore, all whilst dodging the errant tourist and the even more errant pigeon. I suspect, in fact, that the pigeons of Heidelberg are the true heirs to the throne, so thoroughly have they colonized the place. The Great Vat, ah, the Great Vat! An object so ridiculously oversized, one can’t help but suspect that the Electors Palatine anticipated hosting a party for the entire population of Europe, or perhaps intended to ferment the entirety of the Rhine into a single, potent brew. One pictureque spot followed another, and the locals never let you forget the town's history. They are always ready with a longwinded telling of old stories and past rulers. Still, there's a certain charm to the place, a romantic allure that even the most cynical amongst us – and I count myself among their ranks – cannot deny. Heidelberg is, in short, a delightful absurdity, a place where history and student shenanigans collide in a chaotic yet strangely compelling ballet. It is a place that reminds you of the world's beauty, in its decay.
